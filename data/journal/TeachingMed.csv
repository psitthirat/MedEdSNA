Even physicians can be misled by biased health information; however, medical students and physicians are not taught some of the most effective techniques for identifying bias and misinformation online. Intervention: Using the stages of Kolb’s experiential learning cycle as a framework, we aimed to teach 117 third-year students at a United States medical school to apply a fact-checking technique for identifying bias and misinformation called “lateral reading” through a 50-minute learning cycle in a 90-minute class. Each student’s concrete experience was to independently read a biased article and rate its credibility, demonstrating their baseline skills at identifying bias. Students were given structured opportunities for reflective observation through individual and large group discussion. Students were guided through abstract conceptualization to determine techniques and frameworks utilized by fact checkers, specifically “lateral reading”—utilizing the internet to research the background of the author, organization, and citations using independent sources before exploring the article itself in depth. Students’ active experimentation included re-rating the credibility of the same article and discussing further implications with classmates and instructors. Context: In January 2020, sessions were offered to third-year medical students during their required, longitudinal transition-to-residency course. Impact: Compared to baseline, when using lateral reading, students deemed the article less credible. Students’ active experimentation changed whether they identified the organization and sources behind the article as credible. Notably, 86% (53/62) of students who viewed the organization positively pre-intervention did not describe the organization positively post intervention. Similarly, 66% (36/55) of students who cited the sources as positive pre-exercise changed their assessment after the exercise. While three students mentioned the author negatively pre-intervention, none of the 21 students who described the author in a negative fashion post-intervention described the author negatively pre-intervention. Positively describing the organization, author, or sources pre-intervention correlated with differences in credibility rating after the intervention. These findings indicate that teaching students to read laterally may increase their ability to detect bias in online medical information. Lessons Learned: Further research is needed to determine whether students who learned lateral reading via experiential learning will apply this skill in their education and career. Additionally, research should assess whether this skill helps future physicians counter bias and misinformation in ways that improve health. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205058577"

Simulation-enhanced interprofessional education merits more empirical exploration particularly in terms of experiences from different perspectives. Approach: The study aims to provide a multi-perspective in-depth understanding of students’ engagement in a simulation-based interprofessional learning environment. Ninety students and thirteen facilitators participated. We analyzed data from examination sheets of medical and nursing students in a simulation-enhanced interprofessional education course and from a facilitator survey, using manifest inductive content analysis. The analysis was informed by actor network theory and Schön’s reflection on action model. Findings: Students reflected on their performance in relation to (1) personal attributes, such as systemization skills; (2) other team members, such as communication skills; and (3) the surrounding environment, such as efficient employment of resources. They also reflected on the consequences of their actions and future professional growth. We observed group differences in conceptualizations of performance and knowledge enactment. Facilitators’ and students’ perceptions of performance were mostly aligned. Leadership enactment in the learning environment was problematic for students as well as facilitators. Insights: Students’ engagement in the learning environment helped them develop a prototype of their professional identity and explore potential domains or tools for further learning and professional growth. Features of the learning environment fostered teamwork skills and allowed students to learn from each other, thus improving performance. Our findings have several implications for education, and professional practice, including the need for meticulous planning of learning environments and the importance of more intensive pedagogical efforts for soon-to-be health professionals regarding workplace dynamics and potential conflicts. It is also important to consider that an interactive learning environment can invoke reflection on action not only among students but also among facilitators and that this can contribute to the development of clinical praxis. © 2023 The Author(s).

ApproachWe interviewed faculty members, faculty members of medical education departments, and medical students from both public and private medical schools in Türkiye between October 1 and December 31, 2020. Working in pairs, we analyzed the transcripts of 49 interviews using open qualitative coding methods with satisfactory levels of coefficients of agreement. FindingsWe defined six major themes from the qualitative analysis: 1) Fear and concern were the most common reactions when first encountering the pandemic; 2) Teaching methods during the pandemic were primarily unidirectional from faculty to students. This largely one way transmission of information occurred both synchronously and asynchronously; 3) Technological support during the pandemic shutdowns was found to be challenging for both faculties and students; 4) Evaluation of learning during the pandemic was opportunistic and had questionable rigor; 5) Healthy communication was valued by both faculty and students using an array of different tools including social media; and 6) The pandemic had both negative and positive impacts on the educational processes experienced by students and provided by faculty and resulted in recommendations for new approaches to teaching and learning in the future. Medical students were primarily concerned about the susceptibility to COVID-19 of themselves and others, and how the pandemic would affect their progress toward completing their studies. Faculty were primarily concerned about the capacity of online learning to provide clinical learning opportunities and the difficulties of assessing student clinical skills using online modalities. Medical education specialists were primarily concerned about the quality of educational opportunities offered online. InsightsOur findings were similar to other studies conducted in the USA, China, United Kingdom, and other countries. However, the interviews revealed interest among faculty and medical education specialists for further investigation of experiential or active learning models that could be applied in medical education regardless of whether the delivery mode is face-to-face, online, or most likely, blended. In the next stage of our larger scale EDR study, we will design and construct prototype learning environments that incorporate experiential, active, and authentic learning design principles. © 2023 The Author(s).

Until recently, research and intervention development have been limited by the lack of comprehensive theoretical frameworks. A multi-dimensional conceptual model of the medical school environment, developed by Gruppen and colleagues in 2019, provides a useful framework for guiding research and interventions in this area. Approach: Using Gruppen et al’s model, this study investigated experiences of the LE from the perspectives of both URM and non-URM students at a medical school in New York City. In examining experiences of the organizational, social, and physical domains of the LE, we sought to explore the symbolic and experiential links across domains and identify concrete needs for improvement. Findings: Institutional structures and policies, features of the built environment, and social relationships that put learning first and generated a sense of community were highly valued. Although both URM and non-URM students shared many perceptions and experiences, URM students expressed heightened vulnerability to the experiences of devaluation and exclusion. Insights: All participants in the study greatly appreciated aspects of the LE that made them feel like valued members of the community. Medical schools should approach the task of improving the LE for URM students using a comprehensive, multi-dimensional approach. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165297776"

As such, we begin with a narrative grounding in our personal stances. Phenomenon: While there are a growing number of empirical studies of Black physicians’ and trainees’ experiences of racism, there are still few accounts from a first-person perspective. Black authors of these personal commentaries or editorials, who already experience microaggressions and racial trauma in their work spaces, must put on their academic armor to further experience them in publishing spaces. This study seeks to understand the stances Black physicians and trainees take as they share their personal experiences of racism. Approach: We searched four databases, identifying 29 articles authored by Black physicians and trainees describing their experiences. During initial analysis, we identified and coded for three sets of discursive strategies: identification, intertextuality, and space-time. Throughout the study, we reflected on our own stances in relation to the experience of conducting the study and its findings. Findings: Authors engaged in stance-taking, which aligned with the concept of donning academic armor, by evaluating and positioning themselves with respect to racism and the norms of academic discourse in response to ongoing conversations both within medicine and in the broader U.S. culture. They did this by (a) positioning themselves as being Black and, therefore, qualified to notice and name personal racist experiences while also aligning themselves with the reader through shared professional experiences and goals; (b) intertextual connections to other related events, people, and institutions that they—and their readers—value; and (c) aligning themselves with a hoped-for future rather than a racist present. Personal insights: Because the discourses of medicine and medical publishing interpellate Black authors as Others they must carefully consider the stances they take, particularly when naming racism. The academic armor they put on must be able to not only defend them from attack but also help them slip unseen through institutional bodies replete with mechanisms to eject them. In addition to analyzing our own personal stance, we leave readers with thought-provoking questions regarding this armor as we return to narrative grounding. © This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

Through intense residency training and supervision, these learners gradually develop self-assurance in their newfound skills and ways of practice. What remains unknown, however, is how this confidence develops and on what it is founded. This study sought to provide an insider view of this evolution from the frontline experiences of resident doctors. Approach: Using an analytic collaborative autoethnographic approach, two resident physicians (Internal Medicine; Pediatrics) documented 73 real-time stories on their emerging sense of confidence over their first two years of residency. A thematic analysis of narrative reflections was conducted iteratively in partnership with a staff physician and a medical education researcher, allowing for rich, multi-perspective input. Reflections were analyzed and coded thematically and the various perspectives on data interpretation were negotiated by consensus discussion. Findings: In the personal stories and experiences shared, we take you through our own journey and development of confidence, which we have come to appreciate as a layered and often non-linear process. Key moments include fears in the face of the unknown; the shame of failures (real or perceived); the bits of courage gained by everyday and mundane successes; and the emergence of our personal sense of growth and physicianship. Insights: Through this work, we–as two Canadian resident physicians–have ventured to describe a longitudinal trajectory of confidence from the ground up. Although we enter residency with the label of ‘physician,’ our clinical acumen remains in its infancy. We graduate from residency still as physicians, but decidedly different in terms of our knowledge, attitudes, and skills. We sought to capitalize on the vulnerability and authenticity inherent in autoethnography to enrich our collective understanding of confidence acquisition in the resident physician and its implications for the practice of medicine. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153340464"

Clinical reasoning is a complex, evolving, non-linear, context-driven, and content-specific construct which arguably cannot be assessed at one point in time or with a single method. This has posed challenges for educators for many decades, despite significant development of individual assessment methods. Evidence: Programmatic assessment is a systematic assessment approach that is gaining momentum across health professions education. Programmatic assessment, and in particular assessment for learning, is well-suited to address the challenges with clinical reasoning assessment. Several key principles of programmatic assessment are particularly well-aligned with developing a system to assess clinical reasoning: longitudinality, triangulation, use of a mix of assessment methods, proportionality, implementation of intermediate evaluations/reviews with faculty coaches, use of assessment for feedback, and increase in learners’ agency. Repeated exposure and measurement are critical to develop a clinical reasoning assessment narrative, thus the assessment approach should optimally be longitudinal, providing multiple opportunities for growth and development. Triangulation provides a lens to assess the multidimensionality and contextuality of clinical reasoning and that of its different, yet related components, using a mix of different assessment methods. Proportionality ensures the richness of information on which to draw conclusions is commensurate with the stakes of the decision. Coaching facilitates the development of a feedback culture and allows to assess growth over time, while enhancing learners’ agency. Implications: A programmatic assessment model of clinical reasoning that is developmentally oriented, optimizes learning though feedback and coaching, uses multiple assessment methods, and provides opportunity for meaningful triangulation of data can help address some of the challenges of clinical reasoning assessment. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194550895"

An understanding of how teaching in an LIC model differs from teaching trainees in more traditional models is critical to ensuring curricular innovation success through faculty development. Approach: A qualitative approach was used to describe the teaching practices of faculty and learning experiences of student participants in longitudinal integrated clerkships in different clinical and community settings. Forty-five faculty and 20 students participated in focus groups. Thematic analysis of focus group data was used to identify differences and similarities between groups, sites, and specialties. Findings: Two groupings of themes emerged in thematic analysis: (1) precepting strategies distinctive to the longitudinal integrated clerkship model and (2) precepting strategies enhanced when employed in the LIC model. Distinct to the LIC model, preceptors and students described the importance of understanding the curricular structure and supporting students in longitudinal care of patients. Enhanced in the LIC model are the strategies of relationship-based teaching, support of autonomy, feedback, and support of longitudinal growth in skills. Insights: Students and faculty across LIC sites were broadly aligned in their opinions of best practices for teaching in an LIC model. The longitudinal relationship between student and faculty in an LIC distinguishes this model from traditional block rotations and a distinctive approach to successful teaching is demonstrated. Preceptors use time afforded to build trusting relationships with students, which created opportunity for novel teaching approaches and enhanced otherwise effective teaching strategies. A focus on orientation to the curricular model and support of longitudinal relationships with patients may serve as an anchor for faculty development efforts in the development of an LIC. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189516120"

However, without considering the connection between the pedagogical-curricular and the foundational philosophically-defined educational aims of medicine and medical education, critical system reform is unlikely. The transformation of medical education requires leaders uniquely prepared to view medicine and medical education critically as it is and as it ought to be, and who have the capacity to lead changes aimed at overcoming the identified gaps. This paper proposes a five-level topology to guide leaders to develop this capacity. Evidence: Without reference to a shared understanding of a larger, more profound philosophical vision of the ideal physician and of the educational process of “becoming” that physician, efforts to change medical education are likely to be incremental and insufficient rather than transformative. Such efforts may lead to frequent pedagogical-curricular reforms, shifting evaluation models, and paradigmatic conflicts in medical education systems across contexts. This paper describes a leadership program meant to develop transformational educational leaders. The leadership program is built on and teaches the five-level topology we describe here. The five levels are 1) Philosophy 2) Philosophy of Education 3) Theory of Practice 4) Implementation and 5) Evaluation. Implications: The leadership development program exemplifies how the topology can be implemented as a framework to foster transformation in medical education. The topology is a metaphor exemplified by the Mobius Strip, a continuous and never-broken object, which reflects the ways in which the five levels are inherently connected and reflect on each other. Medical education leadership requires deeper engagement with paradigmatic thought to transform the field for the future. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161611343"

Given the constantly evolving nature of social media use, research is needed to explore the attitudes and behaviors of current medical students, for most of whom social media has been a central facet of interpersonal communication and society since they were born. The goal of the current study is to examine students’ social media use and attitudes related to online professionalism. Approach: Two-hundred-twenty-two medical students completed a mixed-methods cross-sectional online survey assessing perceptions of professionalism on social media. The survey was informed using the theory of planned behavior and included validated measures of attitudes, norms, and perceived behavioral control related to social media use and online professionalism. We analyzed data using thematic analysis and descriptive statistics and t-tests were conducted using SPSS 26. Qualitative and quantitative data were integrated during the data interpretation phase. Findings: Quantitative results revealed that students had a positive attitude toward having a social media presence as medical students and future physicians. Students reported: positive attitudes toward sharing positive thoughts, posting photos with family members, and posting photos in white coats or scrubs; neutral attitudes toward posting personal and political opinions; negative attitudes toward posting photos with alcohol, commenting about colleagues or the workplace, using profanity, connecting with patients, and commenting about patients. T-tests revealed significant differences between what students consider to be professional online behaviors for themselves as medical students versus what they believe society will expect of them as a physician. Students reported strong perceived behavioral control regarding professional social media behavior. While students reported they would face some difficulty “cleaning up” some previous content, students strongly disagreed that people’s opinions of their online professional image were beyond their control. The qualitative analysis revealed students’ perceptions of (a) what it means to demonstrate “online professionalism,” (b) the challenges they face related to social media, and (c) training and standards related to social media use. Insights: Overall, our study confirms that students would benefit from e-professionalism training that is not merely disciplinary, but offers them evidence-based recommendations for maintaining medical professionalism while also embracing their personal identity and the benefits of social media as a (future) physician. Policies, guidelines, and training programs should constantly evolve as social norms regarding online communication and online identities evolve. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161571754"

In addition, professionalism silences trainees, forcing them not to question anything that looks or feels wrong in their eyes. Socialization in medicine, in both the undergraduate and postgraduate training spaces, poses challenges for contemporary medical professionals who are expected to fit the shape of the ‘right kind of doctor.’ Intersectionality seems to impact how medical trainees experience professionalism, be it intersections of gender, race, how they dress or adorn themselves, how they carry themselves and who they identify as. Although there is literature on the challenges pertaining to professionalism, not much has been written about the weaponization of professionalism in medical training, particularly in the South African context. There is also a paucity of data on experiences of professionalism during or after social upheaval. Approach: This is part of a study that explored the experiences of professionalism of five medical trainees during protests and after protests, extending into their postgraduate training. The main study had 13 participants, eight students and five graduates, who were all interviewed in 2020, five years after the #FeesMustFall protests. For the five postgraduate participants, we looked at how gender, race, hairstyles, adornment, and protests played out in the experiences of professionalism as medical trainees at a South African university. We employed a qualitative phenomenological approach. An intersectional analytical lens was used in analyzing the transcripts of the five graduate participants. Each transcript was translated as the story of that participant. These stories were compared, looking for commonalities and differences in terms of their experiences. Findings: The participants, four males (three Black and one white) and one Black female, were victimized or judged based on their activism for social justice, gender, and race. They were made to feel that having African hairstyles or piercings was not professional. Insights: Society and the medical profession has a narrow view of what a doctor should look like and behave–it should not be someone who wears their hair in locks, has body piercing, or is an activist, least of all if she is a woman, as professionalism is used as a weapon against all these characteristics. Inclusivity should be the norm in medical education. © 2023 The Author(s).

However, many URM students experience overt and passive marginalization throughout their training and this may be related to how matriculants from URM streams are perceived by their peers. Approach: We conducted a discourse analysis of online discussion forums to explore how URM streams across Canada and the United States are perceived. We analyzed 850 posts from 13 discussion threads published between 2015 and 2020. We used inductive content analysis to develop a data-driven coding scheme from which we identified common themes. Findings: Despite an overall appreciation of the benefits of a diverse workforce, participants engaged in prominent discussions surrounding the merits of URM streams. We identified perceptions that students admitted from URM streams are less academically and clinically competent, with URM applicants reporting feeling unworthy for admission in the eyes of non-URM applicants. Users felt that the influence of socioeconomic status was under-appreciated, and that admissions officers inadequately addressed this barrier. There were some applicants who perceived the admissions process as “broken” with non-URMs displaying a fear of social change, and URMs fearing that the system defines them by their racialized status. Insights: Online discussion forums provide unique insight into perceptions surrounding URM streams. We identified potentially harmful misconceptions about URM students applying to these streams and highlight that actionable measures to reduce marginalization against URM matriculants must begin before medical school. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142201719"

Increasingly, the need to better prepare medical students for uncertainty has been recognized. Our current understanding of medical students’ perspectives on uncertainty is primarily based on quantitative studies with limited qualitative research having been performed to date. We need to know from where and how sources of uncertainty can arise so that educators can better support medical students learning to respond to uncertainty. This research’s aim was to describe the sources of uncertainty that medical students identify in their education. Approach: Informed by our previously published framework of clinical uncertainty, we designed and distributed a survey to second, fourth-, and sixth-year medical students at the University of Otago, Aotearoa New Zealand. Between February and May 2019, 716 medical students were invited to identify sources of uncertainty encountered in their education to date. We used reflexive thematic analysis to analyze responses. Findings: Four-hundred-sixty-five participants completed the survey (65% response rate). We identified three major sources of uncertainty: insecurities, role confusion, and navigating learning environments. Insecurities related to students’ doubts about knowledge and capabilities, which were magnified by comparing themselves to peers. Role confusion impacted upon students’ ability to learn, meet the expectations of others, and contribute to patient care. Navigating the educational, social, and cultural features of clinical and non-clinical learning environments resulted in uncertainty as students faced new environments, hierarchies, and identified challenges with speaking up. Insights: This study provides an in-depth understanding of the wide range of sources of medical students’ uncertainties, encompassing how they see themselves, their roles, and their interactions with their learning environments. These results enhance our theoretical understanding of the complexity of uncertainty in medical education. Insights from this research can be applied by educators to better support students develop the skills to respond to a core element of medical practice. © 2023 The Author(s).

The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requires programs to provide education about health care disparities so residents can contribute to and lead work in this area. However, the literature includes few examples, frameworks, or strategies for preparing residents to develop the knowledge and skills needed to promote health equity, including in their role as clinical teachers. Evidence: In this article, the authors propose leveraging Resident-as-Teacher training to support residents in learning and teaching for health equity. Gorski’s conceptualization of equity literacy provides an evidence-based framework for four main abilities (recognizing, responding, redressing, and cultivating/sustaining) residents and medical students can develop through co-learning about health equity in the clinical learning environment. The authors discuss preconditions, example activities, and assessments strategies for effective health equity education. Based on the principles of social learning theory, the authors recommend that Resident-as-Teacher training be part of an institutional strategy to cultivate a community of practice for health equity education. Implications: Incorporating health equity education into Resident-as-Teacher curriculum offers a potentially transformative part of the broader strategy needed to prepare the next generation of physicians to enact anti-racism and advance health equity. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142443888"

This requires healthcare staff to provide individualized, culturally competent care for autistic people (AP). However, staff are underprepared since disability curricula are not universally implemented, which may exacerbate health disparities for AP. The Alliance for Disability in Health Care Education (ADHCE) delineated staff competencies to address disparities. The purpose of this review was to describe what is known about disability education initiatives and health-related outcomes for AP. The review included published literature on disability education for any health personnel providing services to AP in any setting where healthcare services are delivered. In June 2023, six databases were queried. Of 3,396 screened reports, 42 were extracted. Most articles originated in the United States and reported various instructional strategies on child-focused educational content for small interprofessional groups in various settings. The biomedical and biopsychosocial disability models were prominent. The training covered few, if any, ADHCE competencies and rarely involved collaboration with AP. Positive outcomes included improved functional health, behavior, and communication. Patient-reported outcomes and physical and psychosocial health were underreported. Future initiatives should involve scaled-up global efforts, address core competencies for care across the lifespan, and establish community partnerships to ensure meaningful outcomes. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209690885"

Physicians have not typically received training in how to be effective advocates for systemic change and individuals in policy fields are not usually equipped to understand the complex issues of health science and their intersection with the health system and society. To address this gap, medical school faculty partnered with school of public policy faculty on a collaborative learning model that engaged MD and Master of Public Policy students together to strengthen their collective knowledge of the healthcare landscape, and to build skills to work for health justice. Intervention: We hypothesized that pairing medical students with public policy students to learn about the intersections of health justice and advocacy could enhance the efficacy of each group and provide a new model of collaboration between medical and policy professionals. The students collaborated on a health justice advocacy project through which they provided consultation to an established community organization. Context: The 8-week course took place in the spring of 2021 in Los Angeles, California. Due to Covid-19 the course was taught online and included asynchronous learning modules and live Zoom sessions. The project also served as a pilot for the post-clerkship phase of a new longitudinal health justice curriculum for MD students that launched in August 2021. Impact: Analysis of student work products, course evaluations, partner interviews, and student focus groups showed that students valued learning through their interdisciplinary collaborative work which gave them new perspectives on health justice issues. The community partners indicated that the students consultative work products were useful for their initiatives, and that they found working with MD and MPP students to be a valuable way to think about how to build stronger and more inclusive coalitions to advocate for health justice. This project has the potential for national impact as it aligns with the Association of American Medical Colleges’ renewed focus on the responsibility of academic medicine to partner with communities for health justice. The project also contributed to the national conversation on how to align health systems science education with the aims of health justice through our participation in the American Medical Association Accelerating Change in Medical Education Consortium. Lessons Learned: Leveraging faculty relationships with community partners was crucial for developing meaningful projects for students. Cultivating and expanding community partner networks is necessary to sustain and scale up this type of intervention. Centering the needs of communities and supporting their on-going work for health justice is essential for becoming an effective advocate. Learning communities that bring interdisciplinary students, healthcare providers, policy professionals, and community partners together to learn from one another can create key opportunities for ameliorating health inequities. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144203933"

The purpose of this survey was to determine the remediation and academic performance reporting practices of United States (U.S.) allopathic medical schools in the pre-clerkship phase of their curricula. Approach: After an extensive literature search and feedback from curriculum deans and learning experts, we developed a survey that we sent in the Spring of 2022 to pre-clerkship curriculum officials at all 154 accredited U.S. allopathic medical schools. It addressed curriculum content and structure; pre-clerkship remediation (e.g., course retakes) and reporting (e.g., permanency of transcript notation) practices; documentation and reporting of nonacademic competencies; and participant opinions and recommendations regarding reporting, transparency, and equity. We generated descriptive statistics and did manifest coding of open-ended responses. Findings: We had a response rate of 40% (62/155), with over 71% indicating mainly organ systems-based curricula. Depending on the situation, there were a wide range of remediation approaches for single- and multiple-course failures, including tutoring or learning support, re-exams, and referrals to a promotion board. Professionalism concerns were a top priority to report to residency directors, with significant variability in respondent opinions and practices in reporting remedial activities. Respondents were concerned about equity, both in terms of flexible grading practices and transparency of reporting practices. Insights: The variability in reporting practices across schools, while allowing holistic and individualized approaches to academic support, also creates potential inequities. More work is needed to understand how different reporting practices across institutions may disadvantage marginalized and minoritized student groups at different points in their preparation. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197604752"

The Syrian war has exacerbated the situation, creating obstacles such as destroyed infrastructure, inflated clinical workload, and deteriorated medical training. Poor scientific writing skills have ranked first among perceived obstacles that could be modified to improve Syrian research conduct at every academic level. However, limited access to personal and physical resources in conflict areas consistently hampers the implementation of standard professional-led interventions. Intervention: We designed a peer-run online academic writing and publishing workshop as a feasible, affordable, and sustainable training method to use in low-resource settings. This workshop covered the structure of scientific articles, academic writing basics, plagiarism, and the publication process. It was also supplemented by six practical assignments to exercise the learned skills. Context: The workshop targeted healthcare professionals and medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy trainees (undergraduate and postgraduate) at all Syrian universities. We employed a systematic design to evaluate the workshop’s short- and long-term impact when using different instructional delivery methods and assignment formats. Participants were assigned in a stratified manner to four groups; two groups attended the workshop synchronously, and the other two groups attended asynchronously. One arm in each group underwent a supervised peer-review evaluation for the practical writing exercises (active), while the other arm in each group self-reviewed their work on the same exercises using exemplary solutions (passive). We assessed knowledge (30 questions), confidence in the learned skills (11 questions), and the need for further guidance in academic writing (1 question) before the workshop and one month and one year after it. Impact: One-hundred-twenty-one participants completed the workshop, showing improved knowledge, confidence, and need for guidance. At one-year follow-up, participants showed stability in these gains. Outcomes for the synchronous and asynchronous groups were similar. Completing practical assignments was associated with greater knowledge and confidence only in the active arms. Participants in the active arms engaging in the peer-review process showed greater knowledge increase and reported less need for guidance compared to those who did not engage in the peer-review. Lessons learned: Peer-run interventions can provide an effective, affordable alternative to improving scientific writing skills in settings with limited resources and expertise. Online academic writing training can show improvements regardless of method of attendance (i.e., synchronous versus asynchronous). Participation in supplementary practical exercises, especially when associated with peer-review, may improve knowledge and confidence. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189616639"

As a result, policies and practices reflect dominant historical norms of the medical profession, which can cause tension for trainees from marginalized groups. One such group comprises those who identify as first-generation physicians - those whose parents have not earned an associate’s degree or higher. This group is highly diverse in terms of gender, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status; however, their experiences with institutional professionalism policies and practices has not yet been fully explored. In this study, our aims were to understand the ways in which these participants experience professionalism, and to inform how professionalism can be more inclusively conceptualized. Approach: In November 2022-March 2023, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 first-generation medical students, residents, and physicians and analyzed select national and institutional professionalism policies in relation to key themes identified in the interviews. The interviews were designed to elicit participants’ experiences with professionalism and where they experienced tension and challenges because of their first-gen identity. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis through a critical perspective, focused on identifying tensions because of systemic and historical factors. Findings: Participants described the ways in which they experienced tension between what was written, enacted, desirable, and possible around the following elements of professionalism: physical appearance; attendance and leaves of absence; and patient care. They described a deep connection to patient care but that this joy is often overshadowed by other elements of professionalism as well as healthcare system barriers. They also shared the ways in which they wish to contribute to changing how their institutions conceptualize professionalism. Insights: Given their unique paths to and through medicine and their marginalized status in medicine, first-generation interviewees provided a necessary lens for viewing the concept of professionalism that has been largely absent in medicine. These findings contribute to our understanding of professionalism conceptually, but also practically. As professionalism evolves, it is important for institutions to translate professionalism’s complexity into educational practice as well as to involve diverse voices in refining professionalism definitions and policies. © This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

Research about stress in healthcare typically examines stress as an individual psychological phenomenon, but stress is not only a person-centered experience. Team stress also affects the team’s performance. Unfortunately, research into team stress is limited and scattered across many disciplines. We cannot prepare future healthcare professionals to work as part of IHTs in high-stress environments (e.g., emergency medicine, disaster response) unless we review how this dispersed literature is relevant to medical education. Approach: The authors conducted a narrative review of the literature on team stress experienced by interprofessional teams. The team searched five databases between 1 Jan 1990 and 16 August 2021 using the search terms: teams AND stress AND performance. Guided by four research questions, the authors reviewed and abstracted data from the 22 relevant manuscripts. Findings: Challenging problems, time pressure, life threats, environmental distractors, and communication issues are the stressors that the literature reports that teams faced. Teams reacted to team stress with engagement/cohesion and communication/coordination. Stressors impact team stress by either hindering or improving team performance. Critical thinking/decision-making, team behaviors, and time for task completion were the areas of performance affected by team stress. High-quality communication, non-technical skills training, and shared mental models were identified as performance safeguards for teams experiencing team stress. Insights: The review findings adjust current models explaining drivers of efficient and effective teams within the context of interprofessional teams. By understanding how team stress impacts teams, we can better prepare healthcare professionals to work in IHTs to meet the demands placed on them by the ever-increasing rate of high-stress medical situations. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146230632"

There are limited, if any, options to learn about historical figures in medicine and how they can inform our future in clinical medicine. Evidence: There is an apparent lack of education offered on pivotal figures in medicine across many institutions. The few instances that medical history has been incorporated into the curriculum are further discussed. Implications: In order to incorporate cultural competency in our delivery of care, it is important to consider the diversity of the population we will be serving and how we can prepare to help patients feel heard in their unique issues. In this paper, we propose learning about the true history of certain medical practices, rather than the “colonial” version often utilized in textbooks and lectures, as a means of diversifying students’ perspectives of the origins of these practices as well as giving credit where it is due. The time period during which many of these medical practices were cultivated is referred to as the Islamic Golden Age, but scholars who made contributions belonged to many different faiths and cultural backgrounds. El-Zahrawi was a Muslim physician whose principal work, Kitab-at-Tasrif, contains topics on medicine, surgery, midwifery, pharmacology, therapeutics, diet, psychotherapy, and medical chemistry. He pioneered numerous techniques in surgery and invented surgical devices that are still used to this day. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146796976"

Therefore, inequity must be addressed by dismantling underlying unjust policies, environments, and curricula. However, once these injustices have been taken apart, how do we build more just systems from the rubble? Many current strategies to address this question have foundational values of urgency, solutionism, and top-down leadership. Approach: This paper explores a counternarrative: Design Justice. As a set of guiding principles, Design Justice centers the experiences and perspectives of marginalized individuals and communities. These principles include mutual accountability and transparency, co-ownership, and community-led outcomes, and honoring local, traditional, Indigenous knowledge. Findings: Rooted in critical scholarship and critical design, Design Justice recognizes the interconnectedness of various forms of marginalization and works to critically examine power dynamics that exist in every design process. These co-created principles act as practical guardrails, directing progress toward justice. Insights: This paper begins with an overview of Design Justice’s history in critical scholarship and critical design, providing foundational background knowledge for medical educators, scholars, and leaders in key concepts of justice and design. We explore how the Design Justice principles were developed and have been applied across sectors, highlighting its applications, including education applications. Finally, we raise critical questions about medical education prompted by Design Justice. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204193821"

Approach: In a sociological study, 71 interactions between physicians and simulated patients enacting chronic heart failure were video-recorded in China, Germany, the Netherlands, and Turkey as part of a quasi-experimental research design. Participating physicians varied in specialty and level of experience. The secondary analysis presented in this article used content analysis to study core components of SDM in all of the 71 interactions and a grounded theory approach to observe how physicians responded actively to patients even though they did not actively employ the SDM ideal. Findings: Full realization of the SDM ideal remains an exception, but various aspects of SDM in physician–patient interaction were observed in all four locations. Analyses of longer interactions show dynamic processes of interaction that sometimes surprised both patient and physician. We observed varieties of SDM that differ from the SDM ideal but arguably achieve what the SDM ideal is intended to achieve. Our analysis suggests a need to revisit the SDM ideal—to consider whether varieties of SDM may be acceptable, even valuable, in their own right. Insights: The gap between the SDM ideal and SDM as implemented in clinical practice may in part be explained by the tendency of medicine to define and teach SDM through a narrow lens of checklist evaluations. The authors support the argument that SDM defies a checklist approach. SDM is not uniform, but nuanced, dependent on circumstances and setting. As SDM is co-produced by patients and physicians in a dynamic process of interaction, medical researchers should consider and medical learners should be exposed to varieties of SDM-related practice rather than a single idealized model. Observing and discussing worked examples contributes to the physician’s development of realistic expectations and personal professional growth. © 2024 The Author(s).

Given the predominantly Western origins and Eastern impacts of the WFME programme, this article deconstructs tensions in the programme using postcolonial theory. Approach: Critical discourse analysis examines the intersections of language, knowledge, and power relations to highlight what can or cannot be said about a topic. We employed it to delineate the dominant discourse underpinning the WFME recognition programme. We drew on the theoretical devices of Edward Said, whose work is foundational in postcolonial thinking but has not been widely used in medical education scholarship to date. An archive of literature about the WFME recognition programme dating back to 2003, when WFME first released global standards for medical education, was analyzed. Findings: In the globalization of medical school regulation, the discourse of modernization can be conceptualized as a means of holding knowledge and power in the West, and enacting this power on those in the East, playing on fears of marginalization in the event of non-engagement. The discourse allows these practices to be presented in an honorable and heroic way. Insights: By uncovering the representation of the WFME recognition programme as being modern and modernizing, this article explores how such conceptualisations can close off debate and scrutiny, and proposes further examination of this programme through a lens that recognizes the inherent inequities and geopolitical power differentials that it operates within. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164524141"

however, the determinants of Turkish physicians’ migration decisions are still unclear. Despite its wide coverage in the media and among physicians in Türkiye, and being the subject of much debate, there is insufficient data to justify this attention. With this study, we aimed to investigate the tendency of senior medical students in Türkiye to pursue their professional careers abroad and its related factors. Approach: This cross-sectional study involved 9881 senior medical students from 39 different medical schools in Türkiye in 2022. Besides participants’ migration decision, we evaluated the push and pull factors related to working, social environment and lifestyle in Türkiye and abroad, medical school education inadequacy, and personal insufficiencies, as well as the socioeconomic variables that may affect the decision to migrate abroad. The analyses were carried out with a participation rate of at least 50%. Findings: Of the medical students, 70.7% had emigration intentions. Approximately 60% of those want to stay abroad permanently, and 61.5% of them took initiatives such as learning a foreign language abroad (54.5%) and taking relevant exams (18.9%). Those who wanted to work in the field of Research & Development were 1.37 (95% CI: 1.22–1.54) times more likely to emigrate. The push factor that was related to emigration intention was the “working conditions in the country” (OR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.56–2.28) whereas the “social environment/lifestyle abroad” was the mere pull factor for the tendency of emigration (OR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.45–2.06). In addition, the quality problem in medical schools also had a significant impact on students’ decisions (OR: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.83–2.65). Insights: Although the percentage of those who want to emigrate “definitely” was at the same level as in the other developing countries, the tendency to migrate “permanently” was higher in Türkiye. Improving working conditions in the country and increasing the quality of medical faculties seem vital in preventing the migration of physicians. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166773311"

Trainees currently experience significant discontinuity in the transition from undergraduate (UME) to graduate medical education (GME). The learner handover is intended to smooth this transition, but little is known about how well this is working from the GME perspective. In an attempt to gather preliminary evidence, this study explores U.S. program directors (PDs) perspective of the learner handover from UME to GME. Approach: Using exploratory qualitative methodology, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 Emergency Medicine PDs within the U.S. from October to November, 2020. We asked participants to describe their current perception of the learner handover from UME to GME. Then we performed thematic analysis using an inductive approach. Findings: We identified two main themes: The inconspicuous learner handover and barrier to creating a successful UME to GME learner handover. PDs described the current state of the learner handover as “nonexistent,” yet acknowledged that information is transmitted from UME to GME. Participants also highlighted key challenges preventing a successful learner handover from UME to GME. These included: conflicting expectations, issues of trust and transparency, and a dearth of assessment data to actually hand over. Insights: PDs highlight the inconspicuous nature of learner handovers, suggesting that assessment information is not shared in the way it should be in the transition from UME to GME. Challenges with the learner handover demonstrate a lack of trust, transparency, and explicit communication between UME and GME. Our findings can inform how national organizations establish a unified approach to transmitting growth-oriented assessment data and formalize transparent learner handovers from UME to GME. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148526513"

Intervention: University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) School of Medicine students advocated for a systems approach to responding to traumatic events. Students partnered with educators to introduce an innovative protocol that affords short-term flexibility in curricular expectations (e.g., defer attendance, assignments, assessments) to empower students to rest, gather, or pursue community advocacy work. This study explored students’ protocol utilization and student, staff, and faculty experience with its implementation. Context: UCSF is a public medical school with a diverse student body. Students raised the need to acknowledge the effects of trauma on their learning and wellbeing. Consequently, students and educators created the UCSF Racial and Sociopolitical Trauma protocol (‘protocol’) to allow students time-limited flexibility around academic obligations following events anticipated to inflict trauma on a school community level. The protocol affords students space to process events and engage with affected communities while ensuring all students achieve school competencies and graduation requirements. Impact: We conducted a two-phase mixed methods study: (1) retrospective analysis of quantitative data on students’ protocol use and (2) focus groups with students, staff, and faculty. We used descriptive statistics to summarize students’ protocol use to adjust attendance, assignment submission, and assessments and thematic analysis of focus group data. Across eight protocol activations June 2020 - November 2021, 357 of 664 (54%) students used it for 501 curricular activities: 56% (n = 198) for attendance, 71% (n = 252) for assignments, and 14% (n = 51) for assessments. When deciding to utilize the protocol, student focus group participants considered sources of restoration; impact on their curricular/patient responsibilities; and their identities. The protocol symbolized an institutional value system that made students feel affirmed and staff and faculty proud. Staff and faculty initially faced implementation challenges with questions around how to apply the protocol to curricular components and how it would affect their roles; however, these questions became clearer with each protocol activation. Questions remain regarding how the protocol can be best adapted for the clerkship setting. Lessons Learned: High protocol usage and focus group data confirmed that students found value in the protocol, and staff and faculty felt invested in the protocol mission. This student-initiated intervention supports a cultural shift beyond diversity toward trauma-informed medical education. Partnership among learners and educators can contribute to transforming learning and healthcare environments by enacting systems and structures that enable all learners to thrive. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195449133"

In this study, we surveyed internal medicine primary care residency program directors about the disability-specific education they offer their learners, their attitudes toward physicians’ preparedness to care for people with disabilities, and their perceived challenges to offering more robust disability-specific education. Approach: We developed an on-line survey and forwarded it in 3 weekly emails during October of 2022 to 104 primary care residency program directors. We collected basic information about the residency programs and queried whether they were providing disability-specific education to their residents, which topics were being covered, and perceived barriers to offering additional disability-focused curricula. Data analyses included descriptive statistics, chi-squared, and independent samples t-tests. Findings: Forty-seven program directors responded (response rate 45.2%). The largest plurality of programs was in the Northeast, their average number of primary care residents was 15.6, most (67.4%) hosted primary care clinics in hospitals or academic centers, and 55.6% had affiliated divisions or departments of rehabilitation medicine. The majority of respondents felt that both internists and their own residents (88.3% and 77.8%, respectively) are inadequately educated in the care of people with disabilities, yet only 13 (28.9%) offered disability-focused curricula, and they tended to be narrow in scope. Only 8 of those 13 respondents (61.5%) reported that their disability curricula were required, rather than optional. Participants listed a number of barriers to implementing disability-focused education including a lack of advocacy for such work (65.2%), lack of time in the curriculum (63.0%), lack of expectation by educational governing boards that physicians understand disability-specific care considerations (60.9%), and lack of affiliated expertise in the care of people with disabilities (52.2%). Insights: While the program directors training future primary care physicians largely understand that physicians are inadequately prepared to offer equitable health care to individuals with disabilities, few of them are offering disability-specific education to their residents and most see significant barriers to doing so. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164677366"

It has been used to assess grasp of current clinical practice guidelines and proficiency in addressing issues related to malnutrition. It provides insight into familiarity with and capacity to tackle issues pertaining to malnutrition in clinical practice. Furthermore, it has been used assess the effectiveness of educational interventions aimed at improving nursing professionals knowledge and awareness of malnutrition. Background: The quality of nursing education affects malnutrition risk assessment, monitoring of food intake, and effectiveness of nutrition care. Improvements in malnutrition education require determining the current level of knowledge and benchmarking with other countries. In the Czech Republic, no nationwide assessment of nursing staff malnutrition knowledge has ever been conducted. Approach: The purpose of the study was to translate the KoM-G 2.0 instrument, gather initial validity evidence, and evaluate nursing staff knowledge of malnutrition in inpatient medical, rehabilitation care facilities, and home care in the Czech Republic. All inpatient healthcare facilities and home healthcare facilities in the Czech Republic were invited to participate. The Czech version of the internationally standardized KoM-G 2.0 (KoM-G 2.0 CZ) was used to assess nursing staff malnutrition knowledge between 3 February 2021 and 31 May 2021. A total of 728 nurses began the questionnaire, and 465 (63.9%) of respondents completed it and were included in the study. Data analyses examined instrument difficulty, discriminability, and reliability, as well as sources of variation in knowledge scores. Findings: The psychometric characteristics of the KoM-G 2.0 CZ instrument included the difficulty index Q (0.61), the discriminant index (ULI 0.29, RIT 0.38, upper-lower 30% 0.67), and Cronbach alpha (0.619). The overall mean of correct answers was 6.24 (SD 2.8). There was a significant impact of educational attainment and nutrition training on KoM-G 2.0 CZ scores. Conclusions: Our findings provide initial validity evidence that KoM-G 2.0 CZ is useful and appropriate for assessing malnutrition knowledge among Czech nursing staff. Our research identified gaps in knowledge and examples of good practice in understanding malnutrition that can be applied internationally. The knowledge of academic nurses was greater; therefore, we suggest they play a key role in nutritional care. We recommend continuous education to improve understanding of malnutrition in this setting. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189160435"

This study aimed to investigate these potential inequities in-depth. Specifically, this study attempted to address the following gaps in the literature: (1) studying grades actually assigned to students (as opposed to self-reported ones), (2) using longitudinal data over an 8-year period, providing stability of data, (3) analyzing three important, potentially confounding covariates, (4) using a comprehensive multivariate statistical design, and (5) investigating not just the main effects of gender and race, but also their potential interaction. Approach: Participants included 1,905 graduates (985 women, 51.7%) who received the Doctor of Medicine degree between 2014 and 2021. Most of the participants were white (n = 1,310, 68.8%) and about one-fifth were nonwhite (n = 397, 20.8%). There were no reported race data for 10.4% (n = 198). To explore potential differential grading, a two-way multivariate analysis of covariance was employed to examine the impact of race and gender on grades in eight required clerkships, adjusting for prior academic performance. Findings: There were two significant main effects, race and gender, but no interaction effect between gender and race. Women received higher grades on average on all eight clerkships, and white students received higher grades on average on four of the eight clerkships (Medicine, Pediatrics, Surgery, Obstetrics/Gynecology). These relationships held even when accounting for prior performance covariates. Insights: These findings provide additional evidence that tiered grading systems may be subject to systematic demographic biases. It is difficult to tease apart the contributions of various factors to the observed differences in gender and race on clerkship grades, and the interactions that produce these biases may be quite complex. The simplest solution to cut through the tangled web of grading biases may be to move away from a tiered grading system altogether. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163021192"

However, in U.S. residency selection, holistic review has been difficult to implement, hindered by a reliance on standardized academic criteria such as board scores. Masking faculty interviewers to applicants’ academic files is a potential means of promoting holistic residency selection by increasing the interview’s ability to make a discrete contribution to evaluation. However, little research has directly analyzed the effects of masking on how residency selection committees evaluate applicants. This mixed-methods study examined how masking interviews altered residency selection in an anesthesiology program at a large U.S. academic medical center. Intervention: During the 2019–2020 residency selection season in the University of Pennsylvania’s Department of Anesthesiology & Critical Care, we masked interviewers to the major academic components of candidates’ application files (board scores, transcripts, letters) on approximately half of interview days. The intent of the masking intervention was to mitigate the tendency of interviewers to form predispositions about candidates based on standardized academic criteria and thereby allow the interview to make a more independent contribution to candidate evaluation. Context: Our examination of the masking intervention used a concurrent, partially mixed, equal-status mixed-methods design guided by a pragmatist approach. We audio-recorded selection committee meetings and qualitatively analyzed them to explore how masking affected the process of candidate evaluation. We also collected independent candidate ratings from interviewers and consensus committee ratings and statistically compared ratings of candidates interviewed on masked days to ratings from conventional days. Impact: In conventional committee meetings, interviewers focused on how to reconcile academic metrics and interviews, and their evaluations of interviews were framed according to predispositions about candidates formed through perusal of application files. In masked meetings, members instead spent considerable effort evaluating candidates’ “fit” and whether they came off as tactful. Masked interviewers gave halting opinions of candidates and sometimes pushed for committee leaders to reveal academic information, leading to masking breaches. Higher USMLE Step 1 score and higher medical school ranking were statistically associated with more favorable consensus rating. We found no significant differences in rating outcomes between masked and conventional interview days. Lessons learned: Elimination of academic metrics during the residency interview phase does not straightforwardly promote holistic review. While critical reflection among medical educators about the fairness and utility of such metrics has been productive, research and intervention should focus on the more proximate topic of how programs apply academic and other criteria to evaluate applicants. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153602552"

Prior work has shown that medical students and interns lack confidence and competence in these skills. Thus, understanding the student’s perspective on why these skills are more difficult to acquire is vital for developing and reforming medical curricula. Approach: This study explored procedural skills learning experiences of medical students with qualitative methods. Through purposive sampling, 52 medical students from the third, fourth, and final years were selected for inclusion. Data were collected using six audio-recorded, semi-structured focus group discussions. Transcripts were manually coded and analyzed using inductive content analysis. Findings: Students provided rich and insightful perspectives regarding their experiences in learning procedural skills that fell into three broad categories: 1) barriers to procedural learning, 2) reasons for learning, and 3) suggestions for better learning outcomes. Students described a range of barriers that stemmed from both patient and clinician interactions. Students were reluctant to make demands for their own benefit during clerkships. The most commonly expressed reason for wanting to learn procedural skills was the desire to be a competent and independent intern. The motivators suggested that students felt empathetic toward interns and visualized a successful internship as a learning goal. Participants suggested peer learning, improved teaching of procedural skills, assessments, and feedback to improve their learning. Insights: This study generated valuable information to promote critical reflection on the existing curriculum and pedagogical approaches to procedural skills development. Medical educators need to sensitize the clinical teachers to student perspectives and what students are really learning to make impactful changes to teaching and learning procedural skills. Students’ self-advocacy skills and self-directed learning skills need to be developed for them to seek out learning opportunities and to promote life-long learning. Lessons from this study may also apply to curriculum design in general, especially in teaching clinical skills. Empowering the learner and embracing a learner-centered approach to teaching and learning procedural skills will benefit future clinicians and their patients. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162883433"

By not teaching medical students and resident physicians to recognize common conditions in darker skin, it perpetuates biases that contribute to healthcare disparities for racial and ethnic minoritized groups. In this paper we describe our efforts to engage in institutional anti-racism work by addressing imbalances in representation of darker skin types in visual teaching images within our institution’s curriculum. Intervention: We initially surveyed preclinical medical students regarding their perceptions of skin color representation in two courses. Researchers recorded the skin types of all teaching photographs in these courses in 2020. We then provided feedback and education to faculty, proposing that they increase brown and black skin color representation in educational content. During 2021, we reviewed the same courses and surveyed students again to ascertain the implementation and impact of our proposal. Context: We applied our intervention to two courses, Host & Defense (H&D) and Skin, Muscle, Bone, and Joint (SMBJ) since both courses utilize a large number of teaching images. Impact: From 2020 to 2021, both H&D and SMBJ significantly increased the proportion of visual teaching images that included darker skin types, with an increase from 28% to 42% in H&D and 20% to 30% in SMBJ. Significantly more students in the courses’ 2021 iterations (73% in H&D, 93% in SMBJ) felt that lectures had appropriate representations of darker skin types when compared to students who took the course in 2020 (8% in H&D, 51% in SMBJ). Students in 2021 felt more confident in recognizing dermatological signs and symptoms in patients with darker skin than students in 2020. The majority of students in both 2020 and 2021 reported wanting to see a gradient of skin types for every dermatological condition discussed. Lessons learned: Our work suggests that addressing visual racism can be achieved partly by setting expectations for increased visual representation, collaborating across educational departments, and establishing clear metrics for assessing implementation. Future interventions will require a continual feedback loop of monitoring learning material, assessing faculty and student perception, refining resources, and recommending revisions to improve visual representation across the entire curriculum. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164108512"

In this study, we used the conceptual framework of Jarvis-Selinger et al. to explore the impact of COVID, as a major public health crisis, on the PIF of preclinical medical students in our country. Approach: At two U.S. medical schools, we interviewed 28 medical students twice as they moved from first to second year during the 2020-2021 COVID pandemic and explored the impact of COVID-19 on PIF. We coded the transcribed interviews and identified themes using constructivist thematic analysis. Findings: We identified three themes: 1) mental health and wellness impacts; 2) inhabiting identity as a health professional during COVID; and 3) questioning the role of physicians in society. Routines and support systems were disrupted, undermining wellness and confidence in professional choices. Students noted the need to be public health role models, and COVID prompted feelings of pride, while also causing them to question expectations of self-sacrifice amid a new politicization of medicine. Students felt that physicians must be increasingly engaged in public health and political communication. Insights: Our findings inform medical educators seeking to build a scaffolding to support PIF during a public health crisis, and highlight the importance of current events and politics on PIF. Our recommendations include the need for student support, longitudinal mentorship, curricular space to discuss the impact of sociopolitical factors on PIF, and revisiting foundational concepts such as professionalism to take into account the social and political context. Our findings add to understanding of PIF during the COVID pandemic, but are also relevant to teaching and learning during future public health crises. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168318937"

Fieldwork educators and university academic coordinators who arrange fieldwork placements work with university accessibility services and students to arrange required accommodations, while preserving confidentiality, maintaining high learning standards, and ensuring attainment of professional competencies. This work is complicated by time pressures and heavy caseloads in fieldwork settings. Here we report on a subset of data from a cross-Canada online survey of fieldwork educators (n = 233) and academic coordinators (n = 54) in 10 health and social service professions. Using descriptive statistics, we analyze responses to two question series concerning perceptions of the capacity of disabled students to attain professional competencies, and overall perceptions of students who need accommodations. Respondents showed most concern about competency attainment for learners with cognitive or learning disabilities, followed by neurological and mental health issues. Thematic analysis of open-ended comments suggests doubt regarding the ability of institutional fieldwork sites to adequately implement accommodations. In their perception of learners who need accommodations, academic coordinators were somewhat more negative than fieldwork educators, in particular seeing students who need accommodations as a potential burden that could harm placement relationships with fieldwork sites. They tended to indicate that fieldwork success depended on student insight and self-advocacy. Struggles faced by disabled students in health and social service professions appear to be occasioned not only by disabling systems and institutions, but also by perceptions that they may have diminished competence. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211803568"

However, the dynamics of discourse moves in time sequences during such learning remain underexplored. This study investigated discourse moves used by PBL tutors and tutees to facilitate collaborative knowledge construction, and adopted sequential analysis to unpack the temporal dynamics of such moves during PBL knowledge construction in an Asian context. Approach: This study’s sample comprised 22 first-year medical students and two PBL tutors at an Asian medical school. Two 2-h PBL tutorials were video-recorded and transcribed, and notes were made about the participants’ non-verbal behaviors, including but not limited to body language and technology use. Descriptive statistics and visual representations were used to discern participation patterns as they evolved over time, and discourse analysis was applied to identify specific types of teacher and student discourse moves within knowledge construction. Lastly, lag-sequential analysis (LSA) was adopted to understand the sequential patterns of those discourse moves. Findings: The PBL tutors mainly used probing questions, explanation and clarification, compliments, encouragement, affirmation, and requests when facilitating PBL discussions. LSA revealed that discourse moves had the following four major paths. Teachers’ content-related questions elicited both lower- and higher-level thinking from students; teachers’ statements mediated between students’ thinking levels and teachers’ questions; there were relationships among teachers’ social-facilitation discourse, students’ thinking modes, and teachers’ statements; and there was a sequential relationship among teachers’ statements, students’ facilitation, teachers’ process-related discourse, and students’ silences. Insights: This study revealed the importance of using probing questions to facilitate students’ knowledge construction as they proceeded from lower- to higher-level thinking. This study also fills a gap in the current literature by adopting the innovative LSA methodology to explore teachers’ and students’ discourse move sequences in PBL. The results have important practical implications for PBL tutors regarding when and how to facilitate their students’ collaborative knowledge construction. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164691346"

This study aims to characterize the scope of the field, identify gaps, and propose emerging questions for future study. Method: The authors conducted a narrative review of the medical Spanish education literature published from 2000 to 2023. First, a comprehensive search algorithm was developed across three databases (Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection) and conducted on August 2, 2023. Two reviewers then independently assessed articles for inclusion/exclusion and subsequent categorization of included articles. Results: The search identified 1,303 articles, and authors added ten articles from other sources. A total of 138 individual articles were included in the final categorization and sub-analysis. There has been an upward trend in the number of articles published yearly since 2000. Most publications were educational interventions (67/138, 49%), followed by commentaries/perspectives (27/138, 20%), proficiency testing (17/138, 13%), needs assessments (16/138, 12%), reviews (6/138, 4%), and vocabulary analyses (5/138, 4%). Slightly over half of publications (72/138, 52%) were centered on physicians or physicians-in-training, with 23 (17%) articles applicable across health professions, and a few focused on pharmacists, nurses, physical therapists, psychologists, physician assistants, and genetic counselors. The vast majority (119/138, 86%) were published in medical/scientific journals and 19 (14%) in language/humanities journals. All but two first authors were affiliated with United States institutions, representing 30 states and Puerto Rico. Conclusions: Over the past two decades, many medical Spanish educational interventions have been published, and several assessment tools have been developed and validated. Gaps remain in evaluation data to demonstrate course effectiveness, the use of pedagogical frameworks to guide curricula, faculty development opportunities, and the role of heritage Spanish learners. Future work should address medical Spanish gaps in health professions and medical specialties, explore patient-engaged approaches to research, and evaluate longitudinal outcomes. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201100324"

Spontaneous collaboration among medical learners significantly contributes to this informal learning and is increasingly recognized as a component of the hidden curriculum in medical education. Yet historically, a disproportionate emphasis in medical education has been placed on didactic, structured, and faculty-initiated methods, leaving an important force in medical education understudied and underutilized. We hypothesize that there is significant educational potential in studying and deploying targeted tools to facilitate collaboration among medical learners. Intervention: At our institution, neurology residents implemented the “Daily Fact Pile” (DFP), a resident-led, email-based collaboration that served as a platform to share clinical pearls in an informal, digital way. Participation was voluntary and participants were encouraged to share facts that were new to them and thought to be clinically relevant. Motivated by the positive collective experience, we conducted a retrospective examination of this phenomenon. In this context, we developed the concept of “mutual microlearning” to characterize this efficient, multidirectional exchange of information. Context: Thirty-six residents in a single neurology residency program utilized the DFP at a large university hospital in the USA between 2018 and 2019. After 21 months of spontaneous and voluntary participation, we assessed the feasibility of the DFP, its impact on the education and morale of neurology residents, and compared its mutual microlearning approach to traditional lectures. This was done through a survey of the DFP participants with a response rate of 80.7%, and analysis of the statistics of participation and interaction with the DFP. Impact: Most participants felt that the DFP was beneficial to their education and thought they often or always learned something new from reading the DFP. The impact of the DFP extended beyond education by improving interest in neurology, morale, and sense of teamwork. The DFP was feasible during neurology residency and participation was high, though participants were more likely to read facts than share them. Lessons learned: Mutual microlearning represents an opportunity to augment residents’ education, and well-designed mutual microlearning tools hold promise for complementing traditional teaching methods. We learned that efficiency, ease of use, and a supportive, non-judgmental environment are all essential to the success of such tools.

Even though previously white Afrikaans-rooted universities now have a diverse student population, recent student protests have highlighted the ongoing need for decolonization in higher education. In addition, the majority of public hospitals in the country function under significant staffing, infrastructure, and equipment shortages. Although the mistreatment of medical students has been well described internationally, to date no South African data exists. The aim of this study was to identify experiences of mistreatment of medical students by clinicians and academics at a South African university and to describe the type of mistreatment experienced, the perceived mental health effects, and the influence on academic performance, resilience, and students’ knowledge of current reporting systems. Approach: A cross-sectional study was conducted through a locally developed online survey of 443 medical students at a South African university in May to June 2018, comprising of both open and closed ended questions. Levels of psychological distress (K10) and resilience (CD-RISC -10) were measured. Chi-square and student t-tests were used for the analysis of associations, and linear regressions were used to assess predictors of psychological distress. Qualitative data were analyzed thematically using the approach described by Braun and Clarke. Findings: Of 800 eligible medical students at Stellenbosch University, 443 students (55.4%) completed the survey. Mistreatment, comprising of being ignored/excluded (83.4%), offensive gestures (75.0%), verbal abuse (65.1%) and discrimination (64.4%), was prevalent and pervasive, and was perpetrated mainly by registrars (46.7%) and other medical staff (43.8%). Mistreatment was associated with psychological distress, which was generally high and more severe for females. Resilience, which was higher for males, moderated the effects of gender and perpetrator type on distress. Only 15% of students who had experienced mistreatment, either directly or indirectly, reported it, of which more than half (52.8%) were not happy with the outcome. Most students (80.9%) were not aware of the systems in place to report mistreatment. Insights: Student mistreatment is more highly prevalent among medical students at a South African university compared with studies conducted internationally. Despite over 20 years of democracy in South Africa, high rates of racial and gender discrimination were reported and descriptions of racial, language and gender discrimination were particularly concerning. Since the findings of this study, an anti-bullying poster-campaign has been initiated at the university as well as an online reporting system. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146753151"

From this view, the learner’s role is one of passivity and deference. A contrasting approach, termed curriculum co-creation, frames education as a bi-lateral partnership. Co-creation results from learners, in collaboration with instructors, taking an active role in creating the goals and processes of an educational program. Such a partnership requires substantial revision of the expectations for both learners and instructors. In this Observations article, the idea of co-creation is applied to medical education and an aspirational vision for the role and value of faculty-student co-creation is advocated. Description and Explication: Co-creation partnerships of faculty and students occur in many forms, varying in degree of departure from traditional educational practice. Co-creation principles and partnerships can be deployed for almost all aspects of training including selection and organization of content, effective methods of instruction, and assessment of student learning. The outcomes of co-creation occur at three levels. The most specific outcome of co-creation is characterized by increased student engagement and enhanced learning. Broader outcomes include improved efficacy and value in the educational program and institution while, at the farthest-reaching level, a co-creative process can modify the medical profession itself. Although some specific instructional techniques to promote student involvement and input have historically been deployed in medical education, there is little evidence that students have ever been permitted to share in ownership. Implications for Medical Education: When fully embraced, curricular co-creation will be recognizable through improved student engagement and learning along with a revised understanding of how faculty-student relationships can foment reform in medical education and the culture of the profession. Further scholarship and research will be indispensable to examine how co-creative partnerships can flatten hierarchies within medical education and inspire the medical profession to be more inclusive and effective. Following the model of co-creation is expected to inspire learners by empowering them to participate fully as co-owners of their own education and prepare them to lead medical education in a different direction for the future. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184900510"

Understanding the factors influencing this decision-making process is important for medical educators, policymakers, and healthcare providers to develop effective strategies that support and guide students in making informed decisions. Approach: We distributed an online self-administered questionnaire to clinical-year medical students (Years 4 to 6) and interns from all medical faculties in Jordan. The questionnaire gathered demographic information, specialty preferences, and factors influencing specialty decision-making. We analyzed the data using descriptive statistics and logistic regression. Findings: 1805 participants completed the questionnaire (51.7% women). General surgery was the most preferred specialty among both genders, followed by internal medicine. Women significantly preferred family medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, and dermatology, whereas men significantly preferred urology, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, general surgery, and internal medicine. The factors that most strongly influenced respondents’ specialty preferences were the specialty’s perceived stress levels and working hours, whereas the least influential factors were the specialty’s perceived prestige and role models in the specialty. Women’s specialty preferences were significantly more influenced by their family than men’s. Men were substantially more influenced by specialties’ perceived action-orientation and stress levels than women. Insights: Gender significantly influences medical trainees’ specialty preferences in Jordan. Women tended to prefer specialties that provided greater work-life balance, such as family medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, and dermatology, while men were more drawn toward competitive and profitable surgical specialties like orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, urology, and general surgery. Additionally, family had a stronger influence on women’s decisions, likely due to cultural and social expectations prioritizing marriage and family for women. Career counseling and mentorship programs are needed to provide guidance, support, and networking opportunities that can help women overcome barriers and biases that may hinder their career advancement. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195442170"

While virtual platforms have greatly expanded access to remote clinical learning, case-based clinical reasoning opportunities are scarce in low and middle income countries. Intervention: The Clinical Problem Solvers (CPSolvers), a nonprofit organization focused on clinical reasoning education, launched Virtual Morning Report (VMR) during the COVID-19 pandemic. VMR is an open-access, case-based clinical reasoning virtual conference on the Zoom platform modeled after an academic morning report format available to participants worldwide. The authors conducted 17 semi-structured interviews with CPSolvers’ VMR participants from 10 different countries to explore the experiences of the international participants of VMR. Context: The CPSolvers was founded by US physicians and has now expanded to include international members throughout all levels of the organization. VMR is open-access to all learners. Preliminary survey data collected from VMR sessions revealed 35% of the attendees were from non-English speaking countries and 53% from non US countries. Impact: Analysis generated four themes that captured the experiences of international participants of VMR: 1) Improving clinical reasoning skills where participants had little to no access to this education or content; 2) Creating a global community from a diverse, safe, and welcoming environment made possible by the virtual platform; 3) Allowing learners to become agents of change by providing tools and skills that are directly applicable in the setting in which they practice medicine; 4) Establishing a global platform, with low barriers to entry and open-access to expertise and quality teaching and content. Study participants agreed with the themes, supporting trustworthiness. Lessons Learned: Findings suggest VMR functions as and has grown into a global community of practice for clinical reasoning. The authors propose strategies and guiding principles based on the identified themes for educators to consider when building effective global learning communities. In an interdependent world where the virtual space eliminates the physical boundaries that silo educational opportunities, emphasis on thoughtful implementation of learning communities in a global context has the potential to reduce medical education disparities in the clinical reasoning space and beyond. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162632301"

However, a disconnect persists between the pedagogical approaches of medical practitioners and language educators, leading to a curriculum that emphasizes grammatical accuracy over practical communication skills. This misalignment results in student disengagement and falls short of addressing the real-world demands of the medical profession. With the growing importance of English proficiency in the global health sector, the need for significant improvements in medical English education is evident. This study delves into the underlying causes of student demotivation and aims to reconcile educational delivery with the evolving expectations of the medical field. Insights gained from this research will inform targeted interventions, promising to enhance medical English courses and support improved educational experiences for Chinese medical undergraduates. Approach: This cross-sectional quantitative study surveyed 3,046 second-year medical students from four medical universities in Guangdong Province, China, leveraging means-analysis and Expectancy-Disconfirmation Theory (EDT) as its foundation. The research was conducted at the end of the 2022–2023 academic year, utilizing a questionnaire to assess students’ perceptions of their medical English courses. Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) was the primary analytical tool to discern discrepancies between students’ expectations and experiences. Findings: The IPA revealed that course content, classroom environment, and instructor effectiveness were pivotal factors influencing the perceived quality of the medical English courses. Students expressed a need for practical and relevant course material, with current content and textbooks falling short of preparing them for future medical communication demands. Additionally, while learning technologies were acknowledged, there was a discernible preference against their excessive application, suggesting a misalignment between student satisfaction and learning outcomes. Insights: This study highlights the need for innovative staffing models, refined qualifications for part-time instructors, development of collaborative and practical teaching materials, and focused training for medical English instructors. It also emphasizes the judicious integration of e-learning to enhance the learning experience. These insights aim to improve instruction quality by informing potential pedagogical adjustments and resource allocations in medical English education. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196377022"

Guided by Kotter’s Model of Change to create and sustain cultural change, we developed the Bias Reduction Improvement Coaching Program (BRIC), a two-year, train-the-trainer implicit bias coaching program designed to meet the increasing demand for bias training across a university medical center. Intervention: BRIC trained a cohort of faculty and staff as coaches during four quarterly training sessions in Year 1 that covered 1) the science of bias, 2) bias in selection and hiring, 3) bias in mentoring, and 4) bias in promotion, retention, and workplace culture. In Year 2, coaches attended two booster sessions and delivered at least two presentations. BRIC raises awareness of bias mitigation strategies in a scalable way by uniquely building capacity through department-level champions, providing programming that addresses the ‘local context,’ and setting a foundation for sustained institutional change. Context: In a U.S. academic medical center, 27 faculty and staff from 24 departments were trained as inaugural BRIC coaches. We assessed outcomes at multiple levels: BRIC coach outcomes (feedback on the training sessions; coach knowledge, attitudes, and skills), departmental-level outcomes (program attendee feedback, knowledge, and intentions) and institutional outcomes (activities to sustain change). Impact: After Year 1, coaches reported high satisfaction with BRIC and a statistically significant increase in self-efficacy in their abilities to recognize, mitigate, and teach about implicit bias. In Year 2, attendees at BRIC coach presentations reported an increase in bias mitigation knowledge, and the majority committed to taking follow-up action (e.g., taking an Implicit Association Test). Coaches also launched activities for sustaining change at the broader university and beyond. Lessons Learned: The BRIC Program indicates a high level of interest in receiving bias mitigation training, both among individuals who applied to be BRIC coaches and among presentation attendees. BRIC’s initial success supports future expansion. The model appears scalable and sustainable; future efforts will formalize the emerging community of practice around bias mitigation and measure elements of on-going institutional culture change. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153498469"

Despite calls for UGME curricula to address the complex social and emotional aspects of death and dying, most curricula focus on biomedical, legal, and logistical aspects, or concentrate these topics within palliative care content and/or in simulations with simulated patients and manikins. We aimed to add to death education scholarship by exploring the complexities of death and dying within two dimensional simulations—i.e., in the text-based cases used in Case-Informed-Learning (CIL). Method: We conducted a critical discourse analysis exploring how death and dying were discursively constructed in the formal, planned curriculum at one medical school. We used two methods: (1) Document Analysis: We developed a template to analyze 127 cases regarding their discursive constructions of death and dying; (2) Longitudinal Interviewing: We conducted semi-structured interviews with a cohort of 12 medical students, twice annually throughout their medical program (total 92 interviews). We collectively analyzed data, attuning to how the format, content, and purpose of each case discursively constructed death and dying. Results: There were 127 tutorial cases included in the undergraduate, pre-clerkship case-informed curriculum. In the five (4%) cases featuring a patient who dies, death and dying were discursively constructed as: (1) predictable; (2) a plot device; (3) a cautionary tale; (4) an epilogue; (5) deliberate and careful; and (6) an absence. Very few cases highlighted death and dying in their titles, learning objectives, or questions, and where it did feature, it was framed a biomedical fact or outcome. Only one case allowed for a nuanced, in-depth and open-ended discussion of patient death and dying, but it was scheduled at a time that prevented meaningful engagement. This glossing over the complexities of death was identified as a missed opportunity by students, who, as their clinical placements loomed, were eager to broach this topic in detail with tutors and other teaching faculty. Discussion: Death was often a conspicuous absence in this CIL curriculum. In the few cases that featured the death of the main patient character, multiple discourses were mobilized that worked together to construct death as something that happens elsewhere, outside the parameters of core curriculum. In other words, death happens—predictably, slowly, as a means to an end and the result of moral failures, in the case or somewhere in the future—but was not the primary concern. To deepen engagement with these subjects in CIL, we encourage medical educators to attend to representations of patient death by considering the format, content, purpose, and timing of these cases. Conclusion: Carefully rendered cases thoughtfully embedded in the curriculum offer tremendous potential. We suggest nuanced cases featuring patient death, with plenty of space and time for discussion, reflection, and storytelling may help address gaps in formal UGME preclinical curricula addressing death and dying. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205725089"

Despite their significant influence, these policies rarely receive attention in scholarship examining the processes and outcomes of current health profession education systems. Policy analysis is a field of research that examines how and why policies are developed, the assumptions underpinning policies, and policies’ effects. Given the potential value policy analysis can offer health professions education research, our manuscript aims to 1) describe policy analysis as a field of research that draws on multiple disciplines and methodologies, and 2) demonstrate and discuss what policy analysis research can contribute to health professions education by sharing examples of two studies and discussing their value. To explain how policy analysis can be applied in health professions education research, we describe four key steps and considerations for using policy analysis– (i) assemble your research team; (ii) develop the research questions; (iii) select the methodology for the policy analysis; and (iv) select methods for data collection and analysis. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210034140"

In this context, the COVID-19 pandemic brought simulation to the forefront of clinical education as a training solution when in-person encounters were impossible. As these simulation-based training approaches gain traction, with continued use post-pandemic, it is important to understand how they are currently being used so that appropriate support can be offered to ensure their efficiency and success in the future. Approach: We distributed a survey to South African university departments offering Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology training, inviting participation from students across years of study and clinical educators. Data were collected between October 2022 and February 2023. Twelve responses were received: three from clinical educators and nine from students. We analyzed the responses using descriptive statistics and a domain summary approach. Findings: Simulated activities were implemented as options for clinical education in South African Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology (SLP/A) programs during the pandemic, albeit in a somewhat haphazard way depending on available resources, often with limited preparation or guidance. Some universities have continued using aspects of simulation training post-pandemic. Insights: Our findings, although preliminary, are somewhat consistent with Global North literature, particularly regarding barriers and challenges to implementing these approaches in clinical education. We offer suggestions for enhancing the support of simulation-based clinical education in our context. © 2024 The Author(s).

There has been substantial growth over the past decade of scholarly work produced by SRFCs as they have increased in size and number. Research on patient care outcomes informs better care structures for patients, however there is no current synthesis of patient care outcomes research among SRFCs. This article provides an overview of SRFC research on patient outcomes to understand current research domains and to identify gaps in the literature. Approach: We completed a scoping review by searching Scopus, PubMed, and Journal of Student Run Clinics in June 2021. All peer-reviewed, English-language articles focused on patient-centered outcomes at SRFCs in the US were included. Two independent reviewers performed title, abstract, and full-text screening of relevant works, and eight reviewers conducted data extraction. Descriptive data analysis was performed along with relevant content analysis of patient-centered outcomes. Findings: The search strategy identified 784 studies, of which 87 met inclusion criteria. Most studies were published within the last six years (81.6%), located in California, New York, or Florida (43.7%), and intervention based (33.3%). Many studies (46.0%) had a specific disease of focus of which diabetes was the most researched(19.5%). Patient-centered studies were the leading focus of the study aims (40.2%), where key findings demonstrated primarily improved outcomes in clinic metrics post-intervention (36.8%) or equivalent/better clinical performance than national metrics (20.7%). Insights: This review brings to light gaps in the literature reporting research in SRFCs and can be applied to other low-resource settings. Future efforts to expand SRFC outcomes research should focus on community relationship building, understanding institutional support, and ensuring education on best practices for research within SRFCs. Doing so informs patient care improvement as SRFCs continue to operate as safety net clinics for marginalized populations. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167890376"

Formal instruction on clinical reasoning remains lacking in medical curricula, especially in preparation for the transition from pre-clinical to clinical years. Evidence: Although medical educators have published abundantly on clinical reasoning and acknowledge this to be an essential part of medical education, there remains a global curricular deficiency in developing this skillset. Here we introduce the reader to clinical reasoning frameworks with an emphasis upon practical application. Our focus is upon medical students transitioning from pre-clinical to clinical years of medical school who tend to be overwhelmed with facts but have limited sense of diagnostic approaches due to lack of instruction. Implications: In understanding systematic approaches to clinical reasoning of relevance to medical diagnosis, students will be able to process knowledge in a clinically relevant and discriminatory manner to facilitate problem solving. Upon internship and residency, they will be better prepared for self-learning and reflection as they understand how to hone their capability for diagnosis and management. Medical educators need to acknowledge that clinical reasoning is a practical academic discipline requiring greater curricular emphasis. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164197780"

Despite this apparently formidable remit, it has received little analysis in the academic literature. Evidence: In this article, we examine the historical context at the time WFME was established and summarize the key decisions it has taken in its history to date, highlighting particularly how it has adopted positions and programmes that have seemingly given precedence to the values and priorities of countries in the Global North. In doing so, we challenge the inevitability of the path that it has taken and consider other possible avenues that such a global agency in medical education could have taken, including to advocate for, and to develop policies that would support countries in the Global South. Implications: This article proposes a more democratic and equitable means by which a global organization for medical education might choose its priority areas, and a more inclusive method by which it could engage the medical education community worldwide. It concludes by hypothesizing about the future of global representation and priority-setting, and outlines a series of principles that could form the basis for a reimagined agency that would have the potential to become a force for empowerment and global justice in medical education. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171674697"

Language is inseparable from culture, as language informs, indexes, frames, and encodes both culture and worldview. Spanish is the most common non-English language taught in U.S. medical schools, yet medical Spanish courses tend to artificially separate language from culture. It is unknown to what extent medical Spanish courses advance students’ sociocultural knowledge or patient care skills. Hypotheses: Based on current predominant pedagogy, medical Spanish classes may not adequately integrate sociocultural issues relevant to Hispanic/Latinx health. We hypothesized that students who completed a medical Spanish course would not demonstrate significant gains in sociocultural skills following the educational intervention. Method: An interprofessional team developed a sociocultural questionnaire, and 15 medical schools invited their students to complete the questionnaire before and after completing a medical Spanish course. Of participating schools, 12 implemented a standardized medical Spanish course and three served as control sites. Survey data were analyzed regarding: (1) perceived sociocultural competence (recognition of common cultural beliefs, recognition of culturally normative non-verbal cues, gestures, and social behaviors, ability to address sociocultural issues in healthcare context, and knowledge of health disparities); (2) application of sociocultural knowledge; and (3) demographic factors and self-rated language proficiency (Poor, Fair, Good, Very Good, or Excellent) on the Interagency Language Roundtable scale for healthcare (ILR-H). Results: Overall, 610 students participated in sociocultural questionnaire between January 2020 and January 2022. After the course, participants reported an increased understanding of cultural aspects of communication with Spanish-speaking patients and the ability to apply sociocultural knowledge to patient care (all p < 0.001). When analyzed by demographic factors, students who identified as Hispanic/Latinx or as heritage speakers of Spanish tended to report increased sociocultural knowledge/skills following the course. When examined by Spanish proficiency, preliminary trends showed that students at both ILR-H Poor and Excellent levels did not demonstrate gains in sociocultural knowledge or ability to apply sociocultural skills. Students at sites with a standardized course were likely to improve sociocultural skills in mental health conversations (p < 0.001) while students at control sites were not (p = 0.05). Conclusions: Medical Spanish educators may benefit from additional guidance on teaching sociocultural aspects of communication. Our findings support that students at ILR-H levels of Fair, Good, and Very Good are particularly well-suited for gaining sociocultural skills in current medical Spanish courses. Future studies should explore potential metrics to evaluate cultural humility/competence within actual interactions with patients. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164527077"

Broadening philosophical positions in assessment has educators applying different interpretations to similar assessment concepts. As a result, what is claimed through assessment, including what counts as quality, can be different for each of us despite using similar activities and language. This is leading to some uncertainty on how to proceed or worse, provides opportunities for questioning the legitimacy of any assessment activity or outcome. While some debate in assessment is inevitable, most have been within philosophical positions (e.g., how best to minimize error), whereas newer debates are happening across philosophical positions (e.g., whether error is a useful concept). As new ways of approaching assessment have emerged, the interpretive nature of underlying philosophical positions has not been sufficiently attended to. Evidence: We illustrate interpretive processes of assessment in action by: (a) summarizing the current health professions assessment context from a philosophical perspective as a way of describing its evolution; (b) demonstrating implications in practice using two examples (i.e., analysis of assessment work and validity claims); and (c) examining pragmatism to demonstrate how even within specific philosophical positions opportunities for variable interpretations still exist. Implications: Our concern is not that assessment designers and users have different assumptions, but that practically, educators may unknowingly (or insidiously) apply different assumptions, and methodological and interpretive norms, and subsequently settle on different views on what serves as quality assessment even for the same assessment program or event. With the state of assessment in health professions in flux, we conclude by calling for a philosophically explicit approach to assessment, and underscore assessment as, fundamentally, an interpretive process–one which demands the careful elucidation of philosophical assumptions to promote understanding and ultimately defensibility of assessment processes and outcomes. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165178878"

Curricula that teach contraception and abortion provision during medical school equip medical students with valuable skills and may influence their intention to provide these services during their careers. Family planning is nevertheless understood to be underrepresented in most medical curricula, including in North American medical schools where the laws on providing contraception and abortion have been consequentially changing. This study investigated the prevalence and predictors of contraception and abortion education in North American medical curricula in 2021. Approach: We asked family medicine clerkship directors from Canada and the United States (US) to report about contraception and abortion teaching in their clinical curricula and their school’s whole curriculum and to report on associated factors. Survey questions were included in the 2021 Council of Academic Family Medicine’s Educational Research Alliance (CERA) survey of Family Medicine Clerkship Directors at accredited North American medical schools. Surveys were distributed between April 29 and May 28, 2021, to the 160 clerkship directors listed in the CERA organization database. Findings: Seventy-eight directors responded to the survey (78/160, 48%). 47% of responding directors reported no contraception teaching in the family medicine clerkship. 81.7% of responding directors reported no abortion teaching in the clerkship, and 66% indicated abortion was not being taught in their school’s whole curriculum. Medical school region correlated with the presence of abortion curricula, and schools with high graduation rates into the family medicine specialty reported abortion teaching more frequently. Fewer than 40% of responding directors had received training on both contraception and abortion care themselves. Insights: Contraception and abortion are both underrepresented in North American medical curricula. Formal abortion education may be absent from most family medicine clerkships and whole program curricula. To enhance family planning teaching in North American medical schools, we recommend that national curriculum resources be revised to include specific contraception and abortion learning objectives and for increased development and support for clinical curricula directors to universally include family planning teaching in whole program and family medicine clerkship curricula. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146822088"

Anxiety is among students’ mental health issues. High and persistent anxiety has many negative impacts on students’ academic and personal life. Early detection is essential for timely intervention. Background: Currently, medical student anxiety is assessed using tools primarily designed for psychiatric purposes. Despite their excellent validity evidence, these tools contain sensitive items and do not explore stressors related to clinical activities. There is a need for contextualized tools to better identify anxiety-provoking factors specific to the medical education environment. Approach: We previously developed the Crisis Experience Rating Scale (CERS-7), a short screening tool to identify early on anxious students participating in clinical activities during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study sought to produce further validity evidence for the CERS-7. Medical students in their clinical years at two Swiss and one French medical school, all involved in COVID-19 clinical activity during the second wave of the pandemic, completed the CERS-7 and the State Anxiety Inventory (STAI-A), the best known and widely used tool to measure for general anxiety. We evaluated internal structure using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and relation to other variables using linear regression (LR) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves with thresholds defined using the Youden index. Findings: There were 372 participants. CFA confirmed the two-factor structure of the CERS-7 scale from first-wave dataset. The CERS-7 total scale and subscales demonstrated validity evidence in relationship to the STAI-A scores and categories. A CERS-7 total scale score < 27.5 identified 93% of severely anxious students. Conclusion: The CERS-7 produces reliable scores to use for monitoring anxiety status when assigning students to clinical settings as well as for improving training conditions during clinical crisis. © 2023 The Author(s).

This model conceptualizes wellbeing as a reservoir which is filled or drained through students’ adaptive and maladaptive coping mechanisms. This dynamic process has the capacity to foster resilience and reduce burnout or the inverse. This study aimed to explore health profession students’ coping mechanisms and their experiences of resilience and burnout during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. Approach: Employing the Coping Reservoir Model, qualitative focus groups involving health profession students enrolled at Qatar University were conducted, in October 2020, to solicit their lived experiences of stress and burnout during the pandemic. The Coping Reservoir Model was used to structure the topic guide for the focus group discussion and the Framework Analysis Approach was used in the data analysis. Findings: A total of 43 participants comprised eight focus groups. Health profession students encountered myriad personal, social, and academic challenges during the pandemic which adversely impacted their wellbeing and their capacity for coping. In particular, students reported high levels of stress, internal conflict, and heavy demands on their time and energy. The shift to online learning and uncertainty associated with adapting to online learning and new modes of assessment were exacerbating factors. Students sought to replenish their coping reservoir through engagement in a range of intellectual, social, and health-promoting activities and seeking psychosocial support in their efforts to mitigate these stressors. Insights: Students in this region have traditionally been left to their own devices to deal with stress and burnout during their academic training, wherein the institutions focus exclusively on the delivery of information. This study underscores student needs and potential avenues that health profession educators might implement to better support their students, for instance the development and inclusion of longitudinal wellbeing and mentorship curricula geared to build resilience and reduce burnout. The invaluable contributions of health professionals during the pandemic warrant emphasis, as does an examination of the stress associated with these roles to normalize and justify inclusion of wellbeing and resilience modules within the curriculum. Actively engaging health profession students in university-led volunteer activities during public health crises and campaigns would provide opportunities to replenish their coping reservoirs through social engagement, intellectual stimulation, and consolidating their future professional identities. © 2023 The Author(s).

Students might prefer to study at different times based on their chronotype, aiming to optimize their performance. While face-to-face activities during the academic schedule do not offer flexibility and cannot reflect students’ natural learning rhythm, asynchronous e-learning facilitates studying at one’s preferred time. Given their ubiquitous accessibility, students can use e-learning resources according to their individual needs and preferences. E-learning usage data hence serves as a valuable proxy for certain study behaviors, presenting research opportunities to explore students’ study patterns. This retrospective study aims to investigate when and for how long undergraduate students used medical e-learning modules. Approach: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of e-learning usage at one medical faculty in the Netherlands. We used data from 562 undergraduate multimedia e-learning modules for pre-clinical students, covering various medical topics over a span of two academic years (2018/19 and 2019/20). We employed educational data mining approaches to process the data and subsequently identified patterns in access times and durations. Findings: We obtained data from 70,805 e-learning sessions with 116,569 module visits and 1,495,342 page views. On average, students used e-learning for 16.8 min daily and stopped using a module after 10.2 min, but access patterns varied widely. E-learning was used seven days a week with an hourly access pattern during business hours on weekdays. Across all other times, there was a smooth increase or decrease in e-learning usage. During the week, more students started e-learning sessions in the morning (34.5% vs. 19.1%) while fewer students started in the afternoon (42.6% vs. 50.8%) and the evening (19.4% vs. 27.0%). We identified ‘early bird’ and ‘night owl’ user groups that show distinct study patterns. Insights: This retrospective educational data mining study reveals new insights into the study patterns of a complete student cohort during and outside lecture hours. These findings underline the value of 24/7 accessible study material. In addition, our findings may serve as a guide for researchers and educationalists seeking to develop more individualized educational programs. © 2024 The Author(s).

Many have learned to navigate these challenges through successes and failures, but there is insufficient literature providing these lessons to graduating URiM medical students. Our study among medical school alumni explores strategies to help graduating URiM students prepare for success in residency. Approach: We conducted an online cross-sectional survey (Qualtrics) from February to March 2022. Graduates from a Northeast U.S. medical school identifying as URiM were invited to participate. With emphasis on “thriving” in residency training, we solicited rating-scale responses on preparedness for residency and open-text responses on strategies for success. Standard statistical and text content analysis were used to determine findings and themes. We used Word Cloud technology to further explore word frequency and patterns. Findings: Of the 43 alumni contacted, 23 (53%) completed the survey. Participants were trained in various specialties. We identified three themes with regard to strategies for thriving in residency: (1) importance of identifying and seeking early mentorship; (2) importance of identifying and having diverse forms of support; and (3) need for more education on navigating macro/microaggressions. Insight: While advocating for systems-level interventions to create inclusive learning environments, we highlight the gap in trainee awareness of the importance of seeking early mentorship. Our study provides strategies for graduating URiM medical students to succeed in residency based on respondent experiences. These recommendations should inform medical school curricula. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200027972"

This study explored mentees’ endorsements and/or criticisms of the IM model and how IM constructs and behaviors described in the model benefited them. Background: Models of Indigenous mentorship have been developed previously yet have not yet been empirically examined, restricting our ability to measure or make claims as to their consequences, correlates, and antecedents. Approach: Interviews with six Indigenous mentees asked about their: 1) resonance with the model, 2) stories related to mentors’ behaviors, 3) perceived benefits of their mentors’ behaviors on their journey, and 4) components they felt were missing from the model. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Findings: Overall, the model resonated with participants. Mentees told stories about mentors engaging in the IM constructs practicing relationalism most frequently, followed by fostering Indigenous identity development, utilizing a mentee-centered focus, and imbuing criticality, advocacy, and abiding by Indigenous ethics. Benefits included improved career and work attitudes, motivation, and overall well-being, engaging in helping behaviors, and enhanced criticality. Recommendations to expand the model included incorporating: 1) additional mentor behaviors (e.g., transference of traditional knowledge), 2) higher-order dimensions (e.g., the impact of the institution), 3) specific mentee characteristics (e.g., age and gender), and 4) additional types of mentoring relationships (e.g., peer, multiple mentors). Conclusions: This study showed that Murry et al.’s model resonated with primary stakeholders (i.e., Indigenous mentees), that Indigenous mentorship behaviors have perceived consequences that are important for adjustment, and ways the model is limited or mis-specified.

The purpose of this study was to synthesize the literature on how trauma has been conceptualized and approached within medical education, and the implications thereof. Approach: A metanarrative approach was adopted following the RAMESES guidelines. Searches of 7 databases conducted in January 2022 with no date limitations yielded 7,280 articles, of which 50 were identified for inclusion through purposive and theoretical sampling. An additional 5 articles were added from manual searches of reference lists. Iterative readings, interpretive and reflexive analysis, and research team discussions were performed to identify and refine metanarratives. Findings: Five metanarratives were identified, including the concept of trauma, the trauma event, the person with trauma, the impact of trauma, and addressing trauma, with each metanarrative encompassing multiple dimensions. A biomedical concept of trauma predominated, with lack of conceptual clarity. Theory was not integrated or developed in the majority of articles reviewed, and context was often ambiguous. Trauma was described in myriad ways among studies. Why certain events were experienced as trauma and the context in which they took place were not well characterized. The impact of trauma was largely concentrated on harmful effects, and manifestations beyond symptoms of post-traumatic stress were often not considered. Furthermore, the dominant focus was on the individual, yet often in a circumscribed way that did not seek to understand the individual experience. In addressing trauma, recommendations were often generic, and earlier research emphasized individually-focused interventions while more recent studies have considered systemic issues. Insights: Multiple dimensions of trauma have been discussed in the medical education literature and from many conceptual standpoints, with biomedical, epidemiologic, and individualized perspectives predominating. Greater precision and clarity in defining and understanding trauma is needed to advance research and theory around trauma in medical education and the associated implications for practice. Exploring trauma from intersectional and collective experiences and impacts of trauma and adapting responses to individual needs offers ways to deepen our understanding of how to better support learners impacted by trauma. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191013123"

They range from as simple as medical gloves to as complex as artificial limbs. This versatility of medical devices and their inherent interdisciplinary nature means that academic courses on them are attended by cohorts of students from varieties of academic backgrounds, who bring with them similarly broad spectra of interests. To satisfy the learning expectations of each and every student in such diverse classes is a daunting task for the instructor. After many years of teaching medical devices at undergraduate and graduate levels at three different universities in the states of Illinois and California, I have come up with an instructional method that solves this challenge by engaging students in the co-creation of the curriculum via selection of their own medical devices of interest and presentation to the class for collective analysis. The threefold presentations are designed so that they reflect an ascent along the hierarchy of a learning taxonomy extending from foundational concepts to critical assessment of knowledge to creative displays of it. In such a way, the students are acquainted with the ability of critical and creative thinking at the expense of rote memorization or inculcation and are prepared to enter the field of medical devices as innovation-centered individuals. The specifics of this new method of instruction are reported here, with the hope that they will be useful to fellow instructors in any interdisciplinary course that benefits from a balance between the rigorous coverage of the instructional material pertaining to engineering and medicine and the flexible selection of topics that comply with students’ individual interests. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198553256"

Data were analyzed using Colaizzi’s method. Results: We identified four themes: “Metaphors describing patient care practices,” “Factors affecting care practices,” “Needs for education and support,” and “Opportunities during patient care practices.” Positively influencing factors included better education and living standards and economic benefits, while negatively influencing factors were traumatic events before studying abroad, racial discrimination, language and cultural differences, negative emotions, peer victimization, and lack of use of standards. Interviewees reported a need for training and support and that patient care practices provided opportunities for greater awareness, responsibility, and professional integration. Discussion: Positive and negative experiences of foreign student nurses were evident in the delivery of patient care practice. Interventions are needed to alleviate negatively influencing factors, provide training and support for students, and improve opportunities for foreign nationals. Identification of these factors can help medical educators to develop culturally sensitive and inclusive approaches, as well as individual/organisational facilitators that enhance existing opportunities and remove barriers. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197410548"

The emerging field of culinary medicine offers an experiential nutrition learning approach with the potential to address the need for improved nutrition training of physicians. Exploring this innovative nutrition training strategy, this scoping review describes the nature of culinary medicine experiences for medical students and resident physicians, their impact on the medical trainees, and barriers and facilitators to their implementation. Approach: This scoping review used the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist as guides. Eligible publications described the nature, impact, facilitators, and/or barriers of nutrition and food preparation learning experiences for medical students and/or residents. Additional inclusion criteria were location (U.S. or Canada), allopathic or osteopathic, English, human subjects, and publication year (2002 or later). The search strategy included 4 electronic databases. Two reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts and a third reviewer resolved discrepancies. The full-text review consisted of 2 independent reviews with discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer or by consensus if needed, and the research team extracted data from the included articles based on the nature, impact, barriers, and facilitators of culinary medicine experiences for medical trainees. Findings: The publication search resulted in 100 publications describing 116 experiences from 70 institutions. Thirty-seven publications described pilot experiences. Elective/extracurricular and medical student experiences were more common than required and resident experiences, respectively. Experiences varied in logistics, instruction, and curricula. Common themes of tailored culinary medicine experiences included community engagement/service-based learning, interprofessional education, attention to social determinants of health, trainee well-being, and cultural considerations. Program evaluations commonly reported the outcome of experiences on participant attitudes, knowledge, skills, confidence, and behaviors. Frequent barriers to implementation included time, faculty, cost/funding, kitchen space, and institutional support while common facilitators of experiences included funding/donations, collaboratives and partnerships, teaching kitchen access, faculty and institutional support, and trainee advocacy. Insights: Culinary medicine is an innovative approach to address the need and increased demand for improved nutrition training in medicine. The findings from this review can guide medical education stakeholders interested in developing or modifying culinary medicine experiences. Despite barriers to implementation, culinary medicine experiences can be offered in a variety of ways during undergraduate and graduate medical education and can be creatively designed to fulfill some accreditation standards. © 2024 Taylor &amp;#x0026; Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192092712"

As such, the published literature in our field is dominated by researchers whose work primarily benefits the Western world, casting the rest of what is published as localized and unhelpful knowledge. In this article, we use Audre Lorde’s conception of the Master’s house as a metaphor to narrate the experiences of two South African medical education researchers trying to disseminate their work into North American venues. In addition to narrating these stories, we describe the personal and professional consequences they experienced as a result of their efforts. Evidence: For researchers working outside of the Global North, entering the Master’s formidable house is daunting, and there is no clear pathway in. These narratives illustrate how reviewers and editorial staff act as gatekeepers, continuously shaping ideas about what it means to do acceptable research, and who is allowed to disseminate it within the field. These narratives also show that those who have been rejected by these gatekeepers are often conflicted about their position within the larger field of medical education. Implications: To begin to address this issue, we have made several suggestions for the research community to consider. First, medical education research journals need to create spaces for researchers publishing from the Global South. One suggestion is for journals to create a submission type that is dedicated to researchers working outside of North America. Second, journals should also include more Global South editors and reviewers to help with knowledge translation when articles are submitted from outside North America. If our collective goal is to improve the training of physicians and the health outcomes of humanity, then we need to renovate the Master’s house and begin to break down the barriers that separate us from truly building together. © This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

However, ensuring that all schools meet appropriate standards regarding the quality of subjects, content relevancy, and course delivery takes time and effort. Approach: This study employed a rapid assessment procedure to identify the current knowledge and competencies required to practice medicine effectively in underserved, border, and outer island areas of Indonesia. Ninety-three participants from six remote districts were involved in 12 focus group discussions. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis using the social determinants of health as a guiding framework. Findings: Under decentralized health system governance, the local socio-geographical context is critical to understanding the current public health landscape. Medical education with respect to public health must emphasize physicians’ ability to advocate and encourage the coordination of healthcare services in responding to disasters, as well as community-based surveillance and other relevant data for synergistic disease control. As part of a healthcare facility management team, prospective doctors should be able to apply systems thinking and provide critical input to improve service delivery at local health facilities. Also, recognizing underlying factors is essential to realizing effective interprofessional collaboration practices and aligning them with leadership skills. Insights: This study outlines recommendations for medical schools and relevant colleges in formulating compulsory block or integrated public health curricula. It also provides a public health learning topic that may aid medical schools in training their students to be competent for practice in underserved, border, and outer island areas. Medical schools should offer initiatives for students to acquire the necessary public health competencies merited by the population’s health needs. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192956579"

Studies also suggested significant issues in clinical competence among Ethiopian junior doctors as well concerns regarding unlicensed practice. Given the need to ensure safe health care, we investigated the psychometric properties of the multiple-choice items comprising the Ethiopian national licensing exam (NLE). These analyses help to provide an argument for the validity and reliability of the test scores. Method: We used a cross-sectional study design to analyze data from three cohorts of undergraduate medicine licensing examinations in Ethiopia (2020-2022, N = 2,213). Using Classical Test Theory, we assessed the psychometric properties of 600 MCQ items with 2400 single best answer choices, specifically item difficulty, item discrimination, and the number of nonfunctional distractors, and scale reliability. We provide results regarding the overall test and its sub-domains. Results: Ethiopia’s undergraduate medical licensure examination demonstrated acceptable reliability (Alpha > 0.80), with significant variability in item difficulty and examinee performance. Although these results indicate a sufficiently defensible exam, our results point to issues regarding item statistics, especially a high number of nonfunctional distractors. Conclusions: This study provides first evidence regarding the psychometric soundness of the Ethiopian NLE. However, a significant number of items should be carefully reviewed and possibly revised. As the examination is relatively new, ongoing refinement to item-development and review processes is essential to improve and ensure its quality. © 2024 The Author(s).

Specifically, how attitudes surrounding ownership of patient care develop, what experiences are most influential in shaping them, and how educators can best support this growth are not well known. Therefore, we studied the longitudinal progression of ownership definitions and experiences in medical students across their core clerkship curriculum. Approach: We conducted a series of four longitudinal focus groups with the same cohort of medical students across their core clerkship curriculum. Using workplace learning theory as a sensitizing concept, we conducted semi-structured interviews to explore how definitions, experiences, and influencers of ownership developed and evolved. Results were analyzed inductively using thematic analysis. Findings: Fifteen students participated in four focus groups spanning their core clerkship curriculum. We constructed four themes from responses: (1) students’ definitions of ownership of patient care evolved to include more central roles for themselves and more defined limitations; (2) student conceptions of patient care ownership became more relational and reciprocal over time as they ascribed a more active role to patients; (3) student assessment fostered ownership as an external motivator when it explicitly addressed ownership, but detracted from ownership if it removed students from patient care; and (4) structural and logistical factors impacted students’ ability to display patient care ownership. Insights: Student conceptions of ownership evolved over their core clerkship curriculum to include more patient care responsibility and more meaningful relational connections with patients, including recognizing patients’ agency in this relationship. This progression was contingent on interactions with real patients and students being afforded opportunities to play a meaningful role in their care. Rotation structures and assessment processes are key influencers of care ownership that merit further study, as well as the voice of patients themselves in these relationships. © This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

Applied to medical education, the principles of professional resistance can help learners and teachers balance the responsibilities to respond to harm and injustice with their roles and responsibilities as health professionals. However, there remains the problem of how educators and leaders can constructively respond to learner acts of resistance. It would seem that many leaders have dismissed learner resistance with variations on “Those Darn Kids!”, a complaint that has long been levied at those in younger generations who challenge power and authority. How can productive change in medical education be achieved if learners’ complaints are not taken seriously? Rather than dismissal, leaders and educators in these situations need the tools to engage learners in conversations that draw out their concerns. © This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

The language of medicine (i.e., biomedical discourse) represents queerness as pathological, yet it is this same discourse medical education researchers use to resist that narrative. To be truly inclusive, we must examine and disrupt the biomedical discourse we use. The purpose of this study is to disrupt oppressive biomedical discourses by examining the language and structures medical educators use in their publications about queerness in relation to physicians and physician trainees. Approach. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and ERIC in October 2021 and again in June 2023 using a combination of controlled vocabulary (select terms designated by a database to enhance and reduce ambiguity in search) and keywords to identify articles related to sexuality, gender, identity, diversity and medical professionals. Searches were limited to articles published from 2013 to the present to align with the passage of The Respect for Marriage Act. Articles were included if they focused on the experiences and paths of physicians and physician trainees identifying with or embodying queerness, were authored by individuals based in the United States, and presented empirical studies. We excluded articles only discussing attitudes of cisgender heterosexual individuals about queerness. Two authors independently screened all articles for inclusion. We then used narrative techniques to “re-story” included articles into summaries, which we analyzed with four guiding questions, using queer theory as a sensitizing concept. Finally, we sought recurrent patterns in these summaries. Findings. We identified 2206 articles of which 23 were included. We found that biomedical discourse often: characterized individuals associated with queerness as a single homogenous group rather than as individuals with a breadth of identities and experiences; implied queer vulnerability without naming–and making responsible–the causes or agents of this vulnerability; and relied minimally on actual intervention, instead speculating on potential changes without attempting to enact them. Reflections. Authors each reflect on these findings from their positionalities, discussing: disrupting essentializing categories like “LGBT”; addressing harm through allyship around queerness; editorial responsibility to disrupt structures supporting oppressive biomedical discourse; the importance of program evaluation and interventions; and shifting the focus of medical education research toward queerness using QuantCrit theory. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209141003"

These norms are made salient when women trainees are pregnant. Although it is known that pregnant trainees experience myriad challenges, their experiences have not been examined through the lens of gendered organizations. To understand why these challenges persist, this study critically examined the experiences of pregnant trainees and their program directors (PDs) with navigating pregnancy. Methods: From October 2022 to April 2023, we recruited 13 resident or fellow trainees who experienced pregnancy while in training and their corresponding PDs. Data, in the form of semi-structured interviews, were collected, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Guiding the analysis was feminist theory, in particular Acker’s conceptualization of the ideal worker. The ideal worker norm promotes a culture of individuals who are singularly dedicated to their work with no external distractions or demands upon their time or effort. Results: Both sets of participants struggled with medicine’s image of the ideal worker (i.e., a selfless and untethered professional). Trainees experienced guilt for using entitlements meant to assist them during this time, concern that their requests for help would signal personal weakness, and pressure to sacrifice their own wellbeing for work. While most PDs were aware of these phenomena, they experienced varying degrees of success in combating the negative effects of the ideal worker norm. Discussion: In each case, the image of the ideal worker lurked in the background of medical training, shaping trainees’ experiences and PDs’ perceptions and guidance. This study shows that even though the number of women has increased in medicine, the profession’s underlying culture continues to signal that they must live up to the profession’s expectations of the ideal worker. © This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

Faculty developers have striven to design and deliver myriad of programs or workshops to better prepare faculty members for fulfilling their teaching roles. However, how faculty developers can improve workshop delivery by researching their teaching practices remains underexplored. Intervention: Action research aims to understand real world practices and advocates for formulation of doable plans through cycles of investigations, and ultimately contributes to claims of knowledge and a progression toward the goal of practice improvement. This methodology aligns with the aim of this study to understand how I could improve a faculty development workshop by researching my teaching practices. Context: In 2016, we conducted four cycles of action research in the context of mini-Clinical Evaluation Exercise (mini-CEX) workshops within a faculty development program aiming for developing teaching and assessment competence in faculty members. We collected multiple sources of qualitative data for thematic analysis, including my reflective journal, field notes taken by a researcher-observer, and post-workshop written reflection and feedback in portfolio from fourteen workshop attendees aiming to develop faculty teaching and assessment competence. Impact: By doing action research, I scrutinized each step as an opportunity for change, enacted adaptive practice and reflection on my teaching practices, and formulated action plans to transform a workshop design through each cycle. In so doing, my workshop evolved from didactic to dialogic with continuous improvement on enhanced engagement, focused discussion and participant empowerment through a collaborative inquiry into feedback practice. Moreover, these processes of action research also supported my growth as a faculty developer. Lessons Learned: The systematic approach of action research serves as a vehicle to enable faculty developers to investigate individual teaching practices as a self-reflective inquiry, to examine, rectify, and transform processes of program delivery, and ultimately introduce themselves as agents for change and improvement. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153608177"

Research offers insight into Black women faculty experiences, but studies have largely been conducted on their experiences rather than written by them. We analyzed first-person narratives exploring Black women faculty members’ experiences with racial trauma across the academy considering the intersectionality of racism and sexism to lay the foundation for understanding Black women physicians’ faculty experiences in similar spaces. Approach: We gathered first-person narratives of Black women faculty members in the U.S. from ERIC, Web of Science, and Ovid Medline. We used a variety of terms to draw out potential experiences with trauma (e.g., microaggressions, stigma, prejudice). Articles were screened by two researchers, with a third resolving conflicts. Drawing on constructs from Black feminist theory, two researchers extracted from each article authors’ claims about: (a) their institutions, (b) their experiences in those spaces, and (c) suggestions for change. We then analyzed these data through the lens of racial trauma while also noting the effects of gendered racism. Findings: We identified four key themes from the 46 first-person accounts of racial trauma of Black faculty members in higher education: pressures arising from being “the only” or “one of few”; elimination of value through the “cloak of invisibility” and “unconscious assumptions”; the psychological burden of “walking a tightrope”; and communal responsibility, asking “if not us, then who?” Insights: Black women’s narratives are necessary to unearth their specific truths as individuals who experience intersectional oppression because of their marginalized racial and gender identities. This may also assist with better understanding opportunities to dismantle the oppressive structures and practices hindering more diverse, equitable, and inclusive institutional environments where their representation, voice, and experience gives space for them to thrive and not simply survive within the academy, including and not limited to medicine. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188660018"

We analyze the concepts of categorization, othering, and belonging in medical education, which we use to shed light on the psychological and academic consequences of overgeneralizing social categories. Evidence: The ability to categorize people into different social groups is a natural, subconscious phenomenon. Creating social groups is believed to aid people in navigating the world. This permits people to relate to others based on assumed opinions and actions. Race and gender are two primary dimensions of categorization, with race or ethnicity being a particularly salient category. However, over-generalization of social categories can lead the categorizer to think, judge, and treat themselves and members of a perceived group similarly, leading to prejudice and stereotyping. Social categorization also occurs in educational settings across the globe. The consequences of categorization may influence a student’s feelings of belonging and academic success. Implications: Our analysis reflects on how to promote equitable opportunities for ethnic minority medical trainees through the lens of those who have experienced and succeeded in an inequitable system. By revisiting the social and psychological constructs that determine and influence the academic progress and success of minority students in medical education, we discovered that more engagement is (still) needed for critical discourse on this topic. We expect such conversations to help generate new insights to improve inclusion and equity in our educational systems. © 2023 The Author(s).

A better grasp of the mechanism between these constructs could shed new light on ways to mitigate physician IP and burnout. Grounded in self-determination theory (SDT), the present study explores whether and how residents’ general causality orientations at work—impersonal, controlled, and autonomous—each moderate the effect of IP on physician burnout. Hypotheses: We theorized that the autonomous orientation would buffer the facilitative effect of IP on burnout, while the controlled and impersonal orientations would each enhance it to varying degrees. Method: Two hundred forty-three residents from the Universities of Saskatchewan, Calgary, and Alberta, across various programs, specialties, and years of training, completed a survey containing demographic questions and three previously validated instruments: the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale, Causality Orientations at Work Scale, and Oldenburg Burnout Inventory. We used partial correlation analyses to test our moderation hypotheses. Results: In line with what we expected, the autonomous causality orientation buffered the facilitative effect of IP on burnout, while the controlled and impersonal causality orientations each enhanced it. Conclusions: Results suggest that possessing a stronger autonomous causality orientation (and creating learning/work environments that prime it) will dampen the effect of IP on burnout, while possessing a stronger controlled or impersonal causality orientation (and creating learning/work environments that prime them) will each augment it.

Problem-based Learning (PBL) was first developed in North America and it relies on Western educational and cultural values, thereby raising concerns about its ‘lift and shift’ to non-Western settings. Approach: This review systematically identified and interpretively synthesized studies on students’ and teachers’ experiences of PBL in non-Western medical schools. Three databases (ERIC, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE) were searched. Forty-one articles were assessed for quality using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) checklist and synthesized using meta-ethnography. The final synthesis represented over 5,400 participants from 18 countries. Findings: Findings were categorized into three different constructs: Student Engagement, Tutor Skills, and Organization and Planning. Our synthesis demonstrates that medical students and teachers in non-Western countries have varied experiences of PBL. Students engage variably with PBL, consider knowledge to be better acquired from authoritative figures, and deem PBL to be ineffective for assessment preparation. Student participation is limited by linguistic challenges when they are not native English speakers. Teachers are often unfamiliar with the underlying philosophical assumptions of PBL and struggle with the facilitation style needed. Both students and teachers have developed modifications to ensure that PBL better fits in their local settings. Insights: Given the significant adjustments and resource requirements needed to adopt PBL, medical school leaders and policy makers in non-Western countries should carefully consider possible consequences of its implementation for their students and teachers, and proactively consider ways to ‘hybridize’ it for local contexts. © 2022 The Author(s).

As medical learners navigate a hectic clinical learning environment fraught with challenges to professionalism and ethics, they must simultaneously orient their skills, behaviors, and evolving sense of professional identity. The medical education literature on PIF describes the psychosocial dimensions of that identity formation well. However, in its conceptual formulations, the literature risks underappreciating the pedagogical significance of the moral basis of identity formation—that is, the developing moral agencies and aspirations of learners to be good physicians. Evidence: Our conceptual analysis and argument build on a critical review of the medical education literature on PIF and draw on relevant insights from virtue ethics to deepen the conceptualization of PIF in moral, and not just psychosocial, terms. We show that a narrowly psychosocial view risks perpetuating institutional perceptions that can conceive professionalism norms primarily as standards of discipline or social control. By drawing on the conceptual resources of virtue ethics, we highlight not just the psychosocial development of medical learners but also their self-reflective, critical development as particular moral agents aspiring to embody the excellences of a good physician and, ultimately, to exhibit those traits and behaviors in the practice of medicine. Implications: We consider the pedagogical relevance of this insight. We show that drawing on virtue theory can more adequately orient medical pedagogy to socialize learners into the medical community in ways that nurture their personal growth as moral agents—in terms of their particular, restless aspirations to be a good physician and to flourish as such. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158024150"

Chronic diseases are prevalent within this population, which faces myriad barriers that limit access to healthcare and create significant health care disparities. Yet, disability awareness programs are limited in U.S. medical schools and graduates report a sense of unpreparedness to care for this population. Intervention: Come Roll with Me (CRWM) was implemented as an interprofessional, preclinical experience to provide medical and Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) students an opportunity to engage with wheelchair users and one another. Students rotated through four stations with a licensed physical therapist and wheelchair user facilitator. Stations included (1) manual wheelchair self-propulsion, (2) accessible parking, (3) transfers, and (4) open dialog on barriers to healthcare led by the wheelchair user. Context: This study sought to assess the impact of CRWM on students’ understanding of the barriers and health disparities faced by individuals with disabilities. Assessment was conducted using course evaluations, thematic analysis of student reflection essays and a focus group with the wheelchair user facilitators to determine if CRWM met pre-implementation program goals and objectives, including the Interprofessional Educational Collaborative (IPEC) core competencies. Impact: Student reflections from both disciplines indicated that learners were able to identify a variety of barriers faced by people with disabilities and prioritize methods to mitigate these factors. Approximately 91% of medical students agreed or strongly agreed that CRWM was effective in their learning on course evaluations. Wheelchair user facilitators noted three important outcomes of CRWM: educating, teaming, and impact on students. Lesson Learned: Come Roll with Me is a robust educational activity, as evidenced by the program meeting all goals and objectives as well as (IPEC) core competencies. It provides students a unique opportunity to learn about disability from another profession and wheelchair users. People with disabilities and DPT students are a unique and underutilized pool of educators in undergraduate medical education. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142708015"

The trajectories traveled vary widely, and full participation in a given educational community is not assured. While some medical school and post-graduate training programs may nurture Professional Identity Formation, there is scant support for faculty. To date, the trajectories that Graduate Medical Education faculty travel, what may derail inbound trajectories, and what tools Graduate Medical Education faculty use to navigate these trajectories have not been explicitly described. We explore these three questions here. Approach: Communities of Practice, a component of Situated Learning Theory, serves as a helpful framework to explore trajectories of educator identity development among Graduate Medical Educators. We used a inductive and deductive approach to Thematic Analysis, with Situated Learning Theory as our interpretive frame. Semi-structured interviews of faculty members of GME programs matriculating into a Health Professions Education Program were conducted, focusing on participants’ lived experiences in medical education and how these experiences shaped their Professional Identity Formation. Findings: Participants noted peripheral, inbound, boundary, and outbound trajectories, but not an insider trajectory. Trajectory derailment was attributed to competing demands, imposter syndrome and gendered marginality. Modes of belonging were critical tools participants used to shape PIF, not only engagement with educator roles but disengagement with other roles; imagination of future roles with the support of mentors; and fluid alignment with multiple mutually reinforcing identities. Participants identified boundary objects like resumes and formal roles that helped them negotiate across Community of Practice boundaries. Insights: Despite a desire for full participation, some clinical educators remain marginal, struggling along a peripheral trajectory. Further research exploring this struggle and potential interventions to strengthen modes of belonging and boundary objects is critical to create equitable access to the inbound trajectory for all of our colleagues, leaving the choice of trajectories up to them. © This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

The theory of settler colonialism provides a framework for understanding the structures that affect social determinants of health and the resulting health disparities. Western biomedicine and medical education have been implicated in perpetuating settler colonialism, and as a result Indigenous medical educators and leaders have called for increased education and understanding of the structural and social determinants of health affecting Indigenous populations. One important method is through community-based approaches to curriculum design. In collaboration with community leaders and experts, we identified the need for a curriculum on health in the context of settler colonialism, with a focus on resilience and community-directed efforts to improve wellness and care. Alongside Indigenous leaders and educators, we developed a unique curriculum focused on settler colonialism, the social determinants of health, and the assets inherent to the Native Nation where we work. Developed for non-Native learners and clinicians, the curriculum is designed to help provide context for the historical and political etiologies of health inequities experienced by the local community. Local educators helped shape a video lecture series associated with readings and experiential learning activities in 10 domains, providing an overview of settler colonialism and how it affects the social determinants of health. Our model of education draws upon the strengths and assets of communities and can improve health outcomes as well as learners’ understandings of AI/AN-specific needs. We expect that our collaborative approach results in improved relationships among the Non-Native learners and providers and community members. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204171282"

Accrediting agencies, as the regulatory authorities for medical education, develop policies that impact every program in the U.S.; they have the ability to support patient involvement across the medical education system. In this article, we first review the requirements of U.S. accrediting agencies for undergraduate and graduate medical education to involve patients in educational programs. While agencies have patient members on their committees, they do little to encourage patient involvement through their standards or procedures. We then describe opportunities for accreditation to support patient involvement across teaching and learning activities, curriculum design and evaluation, policymaking and governance, and scholarly endeavors. We link these opportunities to specific standards that could be revised or have their data reporting requirements adjusted. U.S. agencies could also follow the examples of their counterparts outside the U.S., which have created new standards to encourage patient involvement. Ensuring patient representation on educational programs’ governing and policymaking bodies is one among many immediate actions that could be taken by accrediting authorities to encourage system-level reforms. As medical school and residency training represent the beginnings of decades of practice for physicians, properly involving patients would maximize benefits for learners, educators, and society. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212224834"

Little is known about how failing international medical students cope to recover their academic performance. It would be beneficial to investigate the coping strategies they use to help them recover their academic performance and progress. Approach: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 international medical students at two universities in China from September 2020 to January 2021. These students had passed make-up exams or re-sits and progressed academically. A thematic analysis approach was used to identify major themes in the interview data. Findings: After failing initial exams or re-sits, students were found to adopt seven coping strategies to help them pass future examinations and recover their academic performance: (i) increased help-seeking behaviors, (ii) improved learning motivation and attitudes, (iii) improved learning strategies, (iv) improved exam preparation, (v) utilization of library resources, (vi) enhanced time management, and (vii) enhanced English language skills. Of the seven strategies, seeking help from friends, peers, seniors, and teachers was the strategy reported most frequently. Insights: The results of this study provide insights into the coping strategies that international undergraduate medical students adopt to recover from poor academic performance in Chinese universities. Host institutions should recognize the resilience and agency of such students to make positive changes. Furthermore, institutional efforts should be made to develop contextualized intervention plans that stimulate students’ learning motivation and encourage them to adopt self-help strategies by incorporating useful resources (e.g., help from peers, seniors, and teachers). Enrollment should integrate specific English language proficiency criteria, and interviews and entrance exams should be conducted. For some failing students, it may be necessary to provide academic remediation. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153488586"

Through a longitudinal qualitative study of 17 women medical students in their first two years of medical school, we sought to investigate how they navigated their medical school experience. We used a critical lens and narrative inquiry to understand their experiences within the powerful and marginalizing culture of medical school. Our participants identified two essential support groups: those relationships made within, and those sustained outside, medical school. These findings invoked a kinship framework—one where women medical students have a network of chosen kin who provide essential support for them during their first 2 years. The participants’ chosen kin within medical school provided support through recognition of one another, belonging by not belonging, being encouraged to reach out, and creating long-term relationships. The chosen kin outside medical school provided support by reminding the student who they are and creating stability. Integrating models of kinship into medical school as practiced by women medical students may have immense value in providing essential supports for medical students, preventing burnout, and changing the culture of care for future physicians that would align recognition and practice of self-care with patient care. © 2024 The Author(s).

When approaches to CBME rely on residents to initiate WBA, learners experience tension between seeking WBA for learning and for establishing competence. How learners resolve this tension may lead to unintended consequences for both AfL and AoL. We sought to explore the factors that impact both decisions to seek and not to seek WBA and use the findings to build a model of assessment-seeking strategy used by residents. In building this model we consider how the link between WBA and promotion or progression within a program impacts an individual’s assessment-seeking strategy. Approach: We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with internal medicine residents at Queen’s University about the factors that influence their decision to seek or avoid WBA. Using grounded theory methodology, we applied a constant comparative analysis to collect data iteratively and identify themes. A conceptual model was developed to describe the interaction of factors impacting the decision to seek and initiate WBA. Findings: Participants identified two main motivations when deciding to seek assessments: the need to fulfill program requirements and the desire to receive feedback for learning. Analysis suggested that these motivations are often at odds with each other. Participants also described several moderating factors that impact the decision to initiate assessments, irrespective of the primary underlying motivation. These included resident performance, assessor factors, training program expectations, and clinical context. A conceptual framework was developed to describe the factors that lead to strategic assessment-seeking behaviors. Insights: Faced with the dual purpose of WBA in CBME, resident behavior in initiating assessment is guided by specific assessment-seeking strategies. Strategies reflect individual underlying motivations, influenced by four moderating factors. These findings have broad implications for programmatic assessment in a CBME context including validity considerations for assessment data used in summative decision-making including readiness for unsupervised practice. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164178290"

An appropriate way to provide such exposure is through distributed clinical training. This usually entails students training in smaller groups along the continuum of care, away from tertiary academic hospitals. This also means students are away from their existing academic and social support systems. It is evident that knowledge and clinical skills alone are not sufficient to prepare students, they also need to be taught to critically reflect on how their own values and attitudes traverse their knowledge and skills to influence their practice as healthcare professionals. This process of critical reflection should aim to provide a transformative learning experience for students and requires active facilitation. In under-resourced health care contexts where clinicians responsible for student training are facing high patient load, lack of resources, inequitable health care services and high levels of burn-out, the facilitation of student learning may be compromised. Evidence: Clinical learning opportunities that are considered transformative, frequently challenge students’ sense of self and sense of belonging. This experience can have detrimental effects if the processes of transformative learning pedagogy are not adequately facilitated. The provision of support staff, lecturers and clinical facilitators on the distributed training platform is challenged by the remote nature of some of the sites and the cost of recruiting and capacitating additional on-site staff. The potential for what has been termed “transformative trauma” and the subsequent halted transformative learning experience, has ethical implications in terms of student wellness and the educational responsibility institutions carry. Implications: The authors suggest considerations in facilitating an ethical transformative learning process. These include making the transformative learning pedagogy explicit to students and clinical facilitators and using the ‘brave spaces’ framework to help students with individuation and provide them with the tools to understand how emotion influences behavior. Strategies to improve relationship development and communities of support, as well as ideas for faculty development are offered. © 2024 Stellenbosch University.

Federal agencies have worked to optimize epidemiologic research data collection from LGBTQI people. Despite these efforts, research data collection guidelines are inconsistent, and the data remain inadequate. The consequence of neglecting to collect data accurately from LGBTQI people is epidemiologic datasets that distort health professionals’ and policymakers’ perception of who comprises our communities and what the disease burden truly is. Additional harm is accrued by members of the neglected groups, including medical students and trainees, who may feel invisible, disrespected, and unsafe when presented with discriminatory data. With this article, we use our perspectives as a medical educator and a medical student to describe the challenge of working with inadequate LGBTQI datasets. We recommend five actions that can be taken by individuals, departments, and institutions to mitigate harm from the existing datasets: 1) acknowledge the limitations of the data; 2) develop, disseminate, and encourage use of an inclusive lexicon; 3) include LGBTQI-related criteria on peer teaching reviews; 4) engage students and trainees as partners, and if appropriate, content experts to review curriculum; and 5) self-identify as an agent of social change. In addition, we discuss systems-level considerations for realizing the goal of having comprehensive, accurate, and inclusive national data to drive health care delivery and health policy decisions. These include expanding research guidelines to address reporting and dissemination best practices for LGBTQI data, and widespread adoption of data reporting guidelines by biomedical journals. There is an urgent need for data to support quality care of LGBTQI communities.

Medical education is a critical site of intervention for improving the health and health care experiences of these patients. Medical research studies, clinical guidelines, textbooks, and medical education generally, assumes that patients will be white, endosex, and cisgender; gender and sex concepts are also frequently misused. Approach: We developed and piloted an audit framework and associated tools to assess the quantity and quality of medical education related to gender and sex concepts, as well as physician training and preparedness to meet the needs of intersex, trans, and Two-Spirit patients. We piloted our framework and tools at a single Canadian medical school, the University of British Columbia, focused on their undergraduate MD program. We were interested in assessing the extent to which endosexnormativity, cisnormativity, transnormativity, and the coloniality of gender were informing the curriculum. In this paper, we detail our audit development process, including the role of advisory committees, student focus groups, and expert consultation interviews. We also detail the 3-pronged audit method, and include full-length versions of the student survey, faculty survey, and purpose-built audit question list. Findings: We reflect on the strengths, limits, and challenges of our audit, to inform the uptake and adaptation of this approach by other institutions. We detail our strategy for managing the volume of curricular content, discuss the role of expertise, identify a section of the student survey that needs to be reworked, and look ahead to the vital task of curricular reform and recommendations implementation. Insights: Our findings suggest that curricular audits focused on these populations are lacking but imperative for improving the health of all patients. We detail how enhancing curriculum in these areas, including by adding content about intersex, trans, and Two-Spirit people, and by using gender and sex concepts more accurately, precisely and inclusively, is in line with the CanMEDS competencies, the Medical Council of Canada’s Objectives for the Qualifying Examinations, many institutions’ stated values of equity, inclusion and diversity, and physicians’ ethical, legal and professional obligations. © 2023 The Author(s).

However, medical students often find the patient-centered approach challenging. The present study finds a possible discordance between formal intentions of a medical curriculum and the corresponding learning environment. The objective of our study was to explore how medical curriculum resonates with the purpose of patient-centered medicine, including how a possible dynamic may have helped maintain this discordance in undergraduate medical education. Approach: The study took a qualitative approach exploring the medical curriculum via a structured communication course. The educational context for the course was considered a discursive environment, partially constructed through documents. The concept of textual agency was used to analyze curriculum and course documents. This was to explore how competencies were presented in the medical curriculum and course descriptions and how they were translated through the practices of the communication course. Inductive thematic analysis was used to analyze observations made during the course. Findings: Our analysis suggested that the medical curriculum content and structure still emphasize bio-medical disciplines and knowledge domains in students learning. This connected well with the socialization of medical students toward the role as medical experts whose primary task is to provide information, while patients are defined as passive subjects, who received information. The course description also operationalized complexities of patient-centered communication to a measurable, instrumental structure of skills. This focus on one-directional communication frames the students’ understanding of the courses and their performance in it. They learn that: (1) meeting a real patient is a rare opportunity, (2) engaging patients’ thoughts and feelings in the conversation is challenging, and (3) the biomedical aspect should be prioritized in the conversation. Insights: These findings suggested that the medical curriculum we studied gave limited room for patient-centered medicine, even in communication training. The power of macro-level documents framed and focused micro-level learning activities and could help explain observed disharmonies in patient-medical student encounters. We see how patient-centered medicine–in both texts and practice–is represented and enacted as a peripheral activity and patients are given a marginal position in encounters with students. The findings suggested that there are challenges for progress and change toward a more patient-centered communication training and curriculum. However, empirical findings also offered points of departure for course leaders and curriculum planners wishing to take steps toward a stronger and more reflective patient-centered approach in medical education, supported through the document structure and the translation of the curriculum through relevant learning activities. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161584047"

Until now, most EPA frameworks have been developed by professionals within the same specialty. As safe, effective, and sustainable health care ultimately depends on interprofessional collaboration, we hypothesized that members of interprofessional teams might have clear and possibly additional insight into which activities are essential to the professional work of a medical specialist. Approach: We recently employed a national modified Delphi study to develop and validate a set of EPAs for Dutch pediatric intensive care fellows. In this proof-of-concept study, we explored what pediatric intensive care physicians’ non-physician team members (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and nurses) constitute as essential professional activities for PICU physicians and how they regarded the newly developed set of nine EPAs. We compared their judgments with the PICU physicians’ opinions. Findings: This study shows that non-physician team members share a mental model with physicians about which EPAs are indispensable for pediatric intensive care physicians. Despite this agreement however, descriptions of EPAs are not always clear for non-physician team members who have to work with them on a daily basis. Insights: Ambiguity as to what an EPA entails when qualifying a trainee can have implications for patient safety and trainees themselves. Input from non-physician team members may add to the clarity of EPA descriptions. This finding supports the involvement of non-physician team members in the developmental process of EPAs for (sub)specialty training programs. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163954983"

Navigation toward understanding pharmacology can be troublesome, but once the threshold to comprehension is crossed, learners can experience a transformative shift in their ways of thinking and practicing. We conducted an in-depth examination of threshold concepts within pharmacology, aiming to identify and prioritize their learning to improve the medical curriculum and enhance medical treatment and patient safety. Approach: We carried out a consensus generation process using the Nominal Group Technique (NGT) to identify potential threshold concepts in pharmacology. Participant groups of pharmacology experts and medical students considered, identified, reviewed, and ranked potential pharmacology threshold concepts within their own group. Then, using a logical, step-by-step approach, we combined the final ranked data from these multiple NGT sessions. We further analyzed these data using an abductive analysis approach; data were coded, categorized, reorganized, and conceptually mapped after critical evaluation. Conceptual themes were established corresponding to different phases of cognitive schema development. Findings: Six comprehensive conceptual themes were identified: Drug Mechanism of Action; Pharmacotherapeutics; Pharmacokinetics; Drug Receptor Interactions; Drug Terminology and Nomenclature; and Signaling Pathways. These concepts align with many of the key attributes of threshold concepts (e.g., troublesome, integrative and transformative). The cognitive schematic themes generated were (i) acquisition-troublesome; (ii) acquisition-transformative; (iii) automation-troublesome; (iv) automation-transformative. Insights: Transformative learning involves different stages of cognitive schema evolution, including acquisition, elaboration, and automation, and is influenced by both the inherent challenges of the concepts and limitations of human cognition. The high interactivity of these troublesome concepts challenge schema acquisition and automation. Troublesome concepts underpinning procedures or skills, while not easily explained by cognitive rules, can lead to slow, awkward, error-prone performance, creating additional barriers for practice. Integrating concepts into a coherent structure leads to the irreversible assimilation of knowledge and the transferability of both knowledge and skills, influencing learners’ epistemological transitions and ontological transformations at theoretical and professional levels. Further work on designing instructional models around assisting and automating schemas around identified troublesome knowledge, while addressing the impact of cognitive load, has the potential to promote transformational learning. © 2024 The Author(s).

The discrepancy between medical education and the realities of clinical work may contribute to ethical erosion among learners, namely, medical students and residents. Unlike traditional approaches to teaching professional ethics and leadership in medicine, rights-based (aspirational) pedagogies approach trainees as autonomous moral agents, whose work has moral value to themselves and others, who live with the ethical consequences of their professional choices, and whose work shapes their individual moral character. By incorporating teaching strategies that intentionally build learners’ rights-based leadership through the development of moral courage, medical educators may counter important aspects of ethical erosion while promoting learner preparedness, outcomes, and well-being. Military teaching approaches offer a valuable example to medical educators seeking to create structured curricula that foster moral courage to promote rights-based leadership, given the high level of moral and managerial complexity present in both medicine and the military. Through a comparative analysis of professional ethics in the medical and military disciplines, this Observation article explores the validity of applying precedents from military ethics and leadership education to medical training. Through arguments rooted in moral philosophy, military history, and military organizational research, we explore the expansion of rights-based teaching methods within the predominantly traditional and rules-based norms of medical education. In relating these findings to real-life clinical scenarios, we offer six specific, rights-based modifications to medical ethics curricula that have potential to promote morally courageous leadership and counteract the ethical erosion medical students and residents face. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197454799"

Approach: The present study audited 3,566 pre-clinical and clinical multiple-choice and short answer examination questions in the same year (2018) from three medical schools in two continents to review the diversity of patients portrayed. The audit was based on an extension of Critical Race Theory beyond race and ethnicity to include pertinent social determinants of health. Findings: Patients were presented in 1,537 (43.1%) of the audited examination questions. Apart from age (89.4%) and binary genders (93.9%), other diversity characteristics were rarely portrayed (ethnicity 7.2%, relationship status 1.9%, sexual identity 1.1%, socio-economic status 0.5%, geographic residence 0.1%, disability 0.1%), or not at all (non-binary genders; residency status; religion/spirituality). Insights: While presenting excessive and unnecessary patient characteristics in examination questions should be avoided, the absence of many diversity aspects may reduce examination authenticity and defeat the teaching of diversity in medicine.

Post-pandemic, medical schools must evaluate how these disruptions shaped student experiences to optimize the return to in-person learning. Approach: This cross-sectional qualitative study explored medical students’ perceptions of their learning environment during the post-pandemic reintegration period in Oman. Fifty-four preclinical and clinical students participated in six focus group interviews. Content analysis identified key topics characterizing students’ perceptions of change and change processes in the post-pandemic learning environment. The panarchy framework, developed to characterize complex adaptive systems in nature, was used to frame the results. Findings: The return to in-person environments presented a mix of renewed connectivity, involving collaborative benefits alongside transitional adjustment strains. Five major topics characterizing student perceptions of change and change processes in their post-pandemic learning environment were identified: learning skills, developing clinical competence, faculty interactions, physical atmosphere, and social connections. Managing academic schedules and cognitive load as the learning environment opened challenged students’ learning skills. Learners valued a renewed opportunity for interactive application of knowledge through collaboration, patient contact, and empathy skill-building to feel prepared for future practice. Returning to in-person instruction renewed a sense of community and peer support networks disrupted by pandemic isolation. Some students continued to struggle with study-life imbalance and felt ill-equipped to handle post-pandemic demands. Improved access to student support and wellness services was emphasized to ease transitional stresses. Students defined an ideal learning climate as supportive, active, personalized, relevant, challenging, accessible, and collaborative. Insights: While pandemic disruptions posed challenges, they provide opportunities to strengthen the educational system’s resilience moving forward. Our findings highlight an opportunity for medical educators and learners to capitalize on the innovations that emerged during this period, integrating technology with interactive learning activities and reconnecting students with the core values of the medical profession. Applying the panarchy framework to frame this adaptive process could enable the tracking of multi-level interactions within the medical education environment and the evaluation of interventions targeted at identified areas of concern. Further exploration to achieve complete mapping of specific environmental domains onto the panarchical cycles merits future investigation to build integrated resilience frameworks. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205692134"

Clinical reasoning is a complex phenomenon studied through the lens of multiple theories. Although cognitive psychology theories transformed our understanding of clinical reasoning, the theories fell short of explaining the variations in clinical reasoning influenced by contextual factors. Social cognitive theories propose a dynamic relationship between learners’ cognitive process and their social and physical environments. This dynamic relationship highlights the essential role of formal and informal learning environments for learning clinical reasoning. Approach: My research aimed to explore the personal experience of learning clinical reasoning in a sample of postgraduate psychiatry trainee doctors using cognitive psychology and social cognitive theories. A stratified convenience sample of seven psychiatry trainee doctors working in the Mental Health Services in Qatar completed semi-structured interviews in 2020. I analyzed the data manually using theoretical thematic analysis. Findings: I identified three overarching themes with multiple subthemes. The first theme was the hierarchical cultural impact on perceived learning opportunities and learning behavior. The first theme had two subthemes that explored the relationship with team members and the expected hierarchy roles. The second theme was the impact of emotions on the learning and execution of clinical reasoning.The second theme had three subthemes that explored the personal approach to managing emotions related to perceived self-efficacy and professional image. The third theme was characteristics of learning environments and their role in learning clinical reasoning. The last theme included three subthemes that explored stressful, autonomous, and interactive environments. Insights: The results accentuate the complexity of clinical reasoning. Trainees’ experience of learning clinical reasoning was influenced by factors not controlled for in the curricula. These factors constitute a hidden curriculum with a significant influence on learning. Our local postgraduate training programmes will benefit from addressing the points raised in this study for effective and culturally sensitive clinical reasoning learning. © 2023 The Author(s).

To provide a deeper understanding of workplace learning, this study explores the structure and dynamics of advice-seeking networks in two residency programs. Approach: We conducted a survey-based social network study. To develop the survey, we conducted focus group discussions and identified three main categories of advice: factual knowledge, clinical reasoning, and procedural skills. We invited a total of 49 emergency medicine and psychiatry residents who had completed at least six months of their training, to nominate their supervisors and peer residents, as their sources of advice, from a roster. Participants identified the number of occasions during the previous month that they turned to each person to seek advice regarding the three broad categories. We calculated the density, centrality, and reciprocity measures for each advice category at each department. Findings: The response rates were 100% (n = 21) and 85.7% (n = 24) in the emergency medicine and psychiatry departments, respectively. The advice network of emergency medicine residents was denser, less hierarchical, and less reciprocated compared to the psychiatry residents’ network. In both departments, PGY-1s were the top advice-seekers, who turned to PGY-2s, PGY-3s, and supervisors for advice. The ""procedural skills"" network had the lowest density in both departments. There was less overlap in the sources of advice for different advice types in the psychiatry department, implying more selectivity of sources. Insights: Complex social structures and dynamics among residents vary by discipline and level of seniority. Program directors can develop tailored educational interventions informed by their departments’ specific network patterns to promote a timely and effective advice-seeking culture which in turn, could lead to optimally informed patient care. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146935165"

While the value of authentic clinical experiences is acknowledged, whether learning actually occurs is to a large extent dependent on students’ behaviors and attitudes. The kinds of student behaviors and attitudes that are necessary to optimize learning in the clinical environment thus becomes relevant. Evidence: Tips and recommendations to maximize clinical learning in a variety of settings have been well documented. There is, however, a dearth of literature which takes a narrative-based praxis approach focused on resource-constrained environments. We developed this praxis-orientated article as a means to translate the available literature and theory into a simple, practical guide, focused on optimizing clinical learning from a student perspective, remaining cognizant of the particular challenges present in a resource-constrained setting. Implications: Based on the resource-constrained environments our students are exposed to, we outline the following six key aspects: student-driven learning, integration into the community of practice, student engagement, empathy, interprofessional learning opportunities, and feedback for learning. These aspects provide useful pointers for students in general. Furthermore, exploration into what strategies students may utilize in resource-constrained clinical contexts is addressed. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167576964"

They may also encounter various difficulties in accessing health services. Being GM and LW is generally unacceptable in Turkey, and both are perceived as abnormal. Medical students may require education on the subject of sexual orientation to improve their knowledge of and attitudes toward LGBT individuals, to help them remain neutral and avoid prejudice in providing health services for such individuals, and to ensure that such care is unbiased. Intervention: This one-group pretest-post-test design study was performed with third-year students at the Ondokuz Mayıs University Medical Faculty (Samsun-Turkey) on 01–31 September, 2021. Three hundred twenty-five students took part. We evaluated students’ attitudes toward homophobia and being GM and LW following a two-week multidisciplinary education program. The program included such topics as “Marginalization,” “Interaction between cultures,” “Sexual orientation,” “Faith-based marginalization,” “Sub-cultures,” “Health protection,” “Gender,” and “Marginalized groups.” For objective acquisition, we organized small group work, experience-sharing sessions (such as different orientation groups, different ethnic groups, and different behavioral templates), presentations, and panel activities. Context: Some circles in Türkiye regard LGBT individuals as representing an attack on national and spiritual values, and they are used as part of the political discourse. Studies are being performed in some medial faculties in Türkiye concerning the inclusion of subjects related to LGBT individuals in the educational curriculum. However, these studies have not yet assumed the form of a curriculum design including content, method, and testing. It is important for subjects concerning LGBT individuals to be considered more extensively in medical education in Türkiye, and for awareness of the rights of these individuals in the community and of combating discrimination to be improved. Outcome: We observed a significant decrease in students’ homophobia after education. Significant decreases were observed in agreement with statements to the effect that being a GM or LW is a disease, that it can be treated, that people can be identified as GMs and LWs based on their behavior, and that they pose a major threat to society. Lessons Learned: It is unclear whether education aimed at all marginalized groups will produce different results to those of programs aimed specifically at GMs and LWs, but we think that applying programs directed toward discrimination and prejudice together will yield more effective results. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161495367"

An understanding of the current state of the literature can be helpful to program leadership to make evidence-based improvements to the chief residency and for medical education researchers to recognize and fill gaps in the literature. Approach: We performed a scoping review of the literature about chief residency. We searched OVID Medline, PsycINFO, ERIC, and Web of Science databases through January 2023 for publications about chief residency. We included publications addressing chief residency in ACGME specialties in the U.S. and Canada and only those using the term “chief resident” to refer to additional responsibilities beyond the typical residency training. We excluded publications using chief residents as a convenience sample. We performed a topic analysis to identify common topics among studies. Findings: We identified 2,064 publications. We performed title and abstract screening on 1,306 and full text review on 208, resulting in 146 included studies. Roughly half of the publications represented the specialties of Internal Medicine (n = 37, 25.3%) and Psychiatry (n = 30, 20.5%). Topic analysis revealed six major topics: (1) selection of chief residents (2) qualities of chief residents (3) training of chief residents (4) roles of chief residents (5) benefits/challenges of chief residency (6) outcomes after chief residency. Insights: After reviewing our topic analysis, we identified three key areas warranting increased attention with opportunity for future study: (1) addressing equity and bias in chief resident selection (2) establishment of structured expectations, mentorship, and training of chief residents and (3) increased attention to chief resident experience and career development, including potential downsides of the role. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182842476"

Some residency training programs have offered trainees the option to complete their training on a modified schedule in the past. These part-time tracks often involved extending training in order to complete equivalent hours on a part-time basis. Having experience with trainees in such programs, we sought to explore the impact of completing residency training part-time on the professional and private lives of physicians. Approach: Between 2019 and 2020, we conducted interviews with physicians who completed portions of their residency training part-time between 1995 and 2005 in our institution’s pediatrics, combined medicine-pediatrics, and family medicine programs. Findings: Seven female physicians who completed at least some portion of residency part-time were interviewed. To better characterize their experiences, we chose phenomenology as our analytic framework. Members of the research team independently coded each interview and met to resolve conflicts. Codes were then combined and discussed to determine four overarching themes as reasons and benefits of part-time training: The pursuit of extended-time training, logistics, effects on career trajectory, and wellness. These themes highlighted the utility of part-time training and the need for programmatic support to ensure their success. Insights: Based on our findings, adaptability for training and a sense of agency from their part-time experiences persisted throughout interviewees’ careers. Each felt empowered to make career choices that fit their personal and professional needs. These findings suggest further investigation into the benefits of offering time-variable training in residency programs. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129275035"

Simulation is increasingly recognized as a potent method for building and assessing applied competencies. The growing use of simulation and its application in summative assessment calls for comprehensive and rigorously designed programs. Defining the current baseline of what is available and feasible is a crucial first step. This paper uses anesthesia and intensive care (AIC) in France as a case study in how to document this baseline. Approach: An IRB-approved, online anonymous closed survey was submitted to AIC residency program directors and AIC simulation program directors in France from January to February 2021. The researcher-developed survey consisted of 65 questions across five sections: centers' characteristics, curricular characteristics, courses' characteristics, instructors' characteristics, and simulation perceptions and perspectives. Findings: The participation rate was 31/31 (100%) with 29 centers affiliated with a university hospital. All centers had AIC simulation activities. Resident training was structured in 94% of centers. Simulation uses were training (100%), research and development (61%), procedural or organizational testing (42%), and summative assessment (13%). Interprofessional full-scale simulation training existed in 90% of centers. Procedural training on simulators prior to clinical patients' care was performed “always” in 16%, “most often” in 45%, “sometimes” in 29% and “rarely” or “not” in 10% of centers. Simulated patients were used in 61% of centers. Main themes were identified for procedural skills, full-scale and simulated patient simulation training. Simulation activity was perceived as increasing in 68% of centers. Centers expressed a desire to participate in developing and using a national common AIC simulation program. Insights: Based on our findings in AIC, we demonstrated a baseline description of nationwide simulation activities. We now have a clearer perspective on a decentralized approach in which individual institutions or regional consortia conduct simulation for a discipline in a relatively homogeneous way, suggesting the feasibility for national guidelines. This approach provides useful clues for AIC and other disciplines to develop a comprehensive and meaningful program matching existing expectations and closing the identified gaps. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139980794"

The best approach, however, is mainly dependent on a medical school’s context. Graduating students from our institution have reported feeling ill-equipped to care for patients from “different backgrounds” on the Association of American Medical Colleges’ Graduation Questionnaire. We explored how medical students interpret “different patient backgrounds” and what they need to feel prepared to care for diverse patients. Approach: We conducted an exploratory qualitative case study using focus groups with 11, Year 2 (MS2) and Year 4 (MS4) medical students at our institution. Focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and coded using thematic analysis. We used Bobbie Harro’s cycles of socialization and liberation to understand how the entire medical school experience, not solely the curriculum, informs how medical students learn to interact with all patients. Findings: We organized our findings into four major themes to characterize students’ medical education experience when learning to care for patients of different backgrounds: (1) Understandings of different backgrounds (prior to medical school); (2) Admissions process; (3) Curricular socialization; and (4) Co-curricular (or environmental) socialization. We further divided themes 2, 3, and 4 into two subthemes when learning how to care for patients of different backgrounds: (a) the current state and (b) proposed changes. We anticipate that following the proposed changes will help students feel more prepared to care for patients of differing backgrounds. Insights: Our findings show that preparing medical students to care for diverse patient populations requires a multitude of intentional changes throughout medical students’ education. Using Harro’s cycles of socialization and liberation as an analytic lens, we identified multiple places throughout medical students’ educational experience that are barriers to learning how to care for diverse populations. We propose changes within medical students’ education that build upon each other to adequately prepare students to care for patients of diverse backgrounds. Each proposed change culminates into a systemic shift within an academic institution and requires an intentional commitment by administration, faculty, admissions, curriculum, and student affairs. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183043710"

Automatic item generation is a contemporary method that can scale the item development process for production of large numbers of new items, support building of multiple forms, and allow rapid responses to changing medical content guidelines and threats to test security. The purpose of this analysis is to describe three sources of validation evidence that are required when producing high-quality medical licensure test items to ensure evidence for valid test score inferences, using the automatic item generation methodology for test development. Evidence: Generated items are used to make inferences about examinees’ medical knowledge, skills, and competencies. We present three sources of evidence required to evaluate the quality of the generated items that is necessary to ensure the generated items measure the intended knowledge, skills, and competencies. The sources of evidence we present here relate to the item definition, the item development process, and the item quality review. An item is defined as an explicit set of properties that include the parameters, constraints, and instructions used to elicit a response from the examinee. This definition allows for a critique of the input used for automatic item generation. The item development process is evaluated using a validation table, whose purpose is to support verification of the assumptions related to model specification made by the subject-matter expert. This table provides a succinct summary of the content and constraints that were used to create new items. The item quality review is used to evaluate the statistical quality of the generated items, which often focuses on the difficulty and the discrimination of the correct and incorrect options. Implications: Automatic item generation is an increasingly popular item development method. The generated items from this process must be bolstered by evidence to ensure the items measure the intended knowledge, skills, and competencies. The purpose of this analysis is to describe these sources of evidence that can be used to evaluate the quality of the generated items. The important role of medical expertise in the development and evaluation of the generated items is highlighted as a crucial requirement for producing validation evidence. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138169047"

Yet, tiered grading has a questionable historic pedagogic basis in American medical education, and evidence suggests that tiered grading itself is a source of student burnout, anxiety, depression, increased competitiveness, reduced group cohesion, and racial biases. Evidence: In its most basic form, medical student evaluation is an assessment of the initial cognitive and technical competencies ultimately needed for the safe and effective practice of contemporary medicine. At many American medical schools, such evaluation relies largely on norm-based comparisons, such as tiered grading. Yet, tiered grading can cause student distress, is considered unfair by most students, is associated with biases against under-represented minorities, and demonstrates inconsistent correlation with residency performance. While arguments that tiered grading motivates student performance have enjoyed historic precedence in academia, such arguments are not supported by robust data or theories of motivation. Implications: Given the evolving recognition of the deleterious effects on medical student mental health, cohesiveness, and diversity, the use of tiered grading in medical schools to measure or stimulate academic performance, or by residency program directors to distinguish residency applicants, remains questionable. Examination of tiered grading in its historical, psychometric, psychosocial, and moral dimensions and the various arguments used to maintain it reveals a need for investigation of, if not transition to, alternative and non-tiered assessments of our medical students. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131197398"

Modern technologies are becoming increasingly embedded in routine medical practice with far-reaching impacts on the patient-physician relationship and the very essence of the health professions. These impacts are often difficult to predict and can create unintended consequences for medical education. This article is driven by a main question: How do we prepare trainees to critically assess technologies that we cannot foresee and effectively use technology to support equitable and compassionate care? Evidence: We translate insights from the philosophy of technology into a proposal for integrating critical technical consciousness in medical curricula. We identify three areas required to develop critical consciousness with regard to emerging technologies. The first area is technical literacy, which involves not just knowing how to use technology, but also understanding its limitations and appropriate contexts for use. The second area is the ability to assess the social impact of technology. This practice requires understanding that while technification creates new possibilities it can also have adverse, unintended consequences. The third area is critical reflection on the relationship between ‘the human’ and ‘the technical’ as it relates to the values of the medical profession and professional identity formation. Human and technology are two sides of the same coin; therefore, thinking critically about technology also forces us to think about what we consider ‘the human side of medicine’. Implications: Critical technical consciousness can be fostered through an educational program underpinned by the recognition that, although technological innovation can create new possibilities for healing, technology is never neutral. Rather, it is imperative to emphasize that technology is interwoven with the social fabric that is essential to healing. Like medication, technology can be both potion and poison. © 2022 The Author(s).

Little is known about resident physicians’ direct experience of eliciting patients’ values, goals, and priorities and integrating them into routine hospital care. Intervention: In 2017, we asked resident physicians on general internal medicine wards rotations to elicit and document a “Personal History” from patients upon hospital admission, in addition to a traditional social history. We defined a Personal History as documenting “what matters most to the patient and why.” The purpose of the Personal History was to understand and consider patients’ values, goals, and priorities. We then conducted qualitative interviews of the resident physicians to understand their experiences eliciting and integrating patients’ values, goals, and priorities in routine hospital care. Context: We performed this exploratory intervention at a large high-volume urban hospital. Two teams from general medicine wards participated in the Personal History intervention. We conducted voluntary interviews of eligible residents (n = 14/15; 93%) about their experience after they completed their general wards rotations. Using the coproduction model, our aim was to explore how patients’ self-expertise can be combined with physicians’ medical expertise to achieve patient-centered care. Impact: Four major themes were identified: 1) Taking a Personal History had value, and eliciting patients’ self-expertise had the potential to change medical decision making, 2) Situational and relational factors created barriers to obtaining a Personal History, 3) Variability in buy-in with the proposed intervention affected effort, and 4) Meaningful Personal History taking could be an adaptive and longitudinal process. Perceived benefits included improved rapport with patients, helpful for patients with complex medical history, and improved physician-patient communication. Barriers included patient distress, lack of rapport, and responses from patients which did not add new insights. Accountability from attending physicians affected resident effort. Suggested future applications were for patients with serious illness, integration into electronic health records, and skills taught in medical education. Lessons Learned: Resident physicians had generally positive views of eliciting a Personal History from patients upon admission to the hospital. Overall, many residents conveyed the perceived ability to elicit and consider patient’s values, goals, and priorities in certain situations (e.g., patient not in distress, adequate rapport, lack of competing priorities such as medical emergencies or overwhelming workloads). External factors, such as electronic health record design and accountability from attending physicians, may further promote residents’ efforts to routinely incorporate patients’ values, goals, and priorities in clinical care. Increasing familiarity among both resident physicians and patients in routinely discussing patients’ values, goals, and priorities may facilitate patient-centered practice. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123486344"

One approach to increasing language concordant care is the use of second language skills by healthcare staff. The desire to use second language skills may have unintended consequences when individuals step beyond their language abilities and can cause more harm than do good for limited-English proficiency patients. Medical students are in a unique position that places them at increased risk for inappropriately using second language skills. Evidence: The use of qualified healthcare interpreters has been shown to mitigate some of the disparities seen with limited-English proficiency patients including poorer healthcare outcomes, less access to care, and lower patient satisfaction. In spite of this knowledge, studies have demonstrated the phenomenon of residents and physicians “getting by” without the use of an interpreter, even when they recognized that their language competency was insufficient to provide high quality care. Regardless of language ability, medical students are asked to engage in conversations with Spanish speaking patients that are beyond their level of language competency. Students vary in their perceived language ability and level of comfort engaging in different clinical scenarios with limited-English proficiency patients. Implications: Students are in a unique position of vulnerability to pressures to use second language skills in situations that step beyond their abilities. We explore how hierarchy intensifies previously established factors, including a lack of adequate training or evaluation and other structural barriers, in contributing to medical students’ inappropriate use of Spanish with limited-English proficiency patients. We propose an approach that includes student education, standardization of clinic rules regarding interpretation, and comprehensive faculty development to address this important patient care issue. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111632949"

Background: Multiple choice questions are a popular format used in medical programs of assessment. A challenge for educators is creating high-quality items efficiently. For expediency’s sake, a standard practice is for faculties to repeat items in examinations from year to year. This study aims to compare the quality of student-authored with clinician-authored items as a potential source of new items to include in faculty item banks. Approach: We invited Year IV and V medical students at the University of Adelaide to participate in a mock examination. The participants first completed an online instructional module on strategies for answering and writing MCQs, then submitted one original MCQ each for potential inclusion in the mock examination. Two 180-item mock examinations, one for each year level, were constructed. Each consisted of 90 student-authored items and 90 clinician-authored items. Participants were blinded to the author of each item. Each item was analyzed for item difficulty and discrimination, number of item-writing flaws (IWFs) and non-functioning distractors (NFDs), and cognitive skill level (using a modified version of Bloom’s taxonomy). Findings: Eighty-nine and 91 students completed the Year IV and V examinations, respectively. Student-authored items, compared with clinician-authored items, tended to be written at both a lower cognitive skill and difficulty level. They contained a significantly higher rate of IWFs (2–3.5 times) and NFDs (1.18 times). However, they were equally or better discriminating items than clinician-authored items. Conclusions: Students can author MCQ items with comparable discrimination to clinician-authored items, despite being inferior in other parameters. Student-authored items may be considered a potential source of material for faculty item banks; however, several barriers exist to their use in a summative setting. The overall quality of items remains suboptimal, regardless of author. This highlights the need for ongoing faculty training in item writing. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132677848"

Intervention: We implemented a 4-module curriculum for PGY1 internal medicine residents. The program focused on the managerial skills necessary for daily clinical leadership, followed by clinical coaching. Interns were first introduced to foundational concepts and then given the opportunity to apply those concepts to real-world practice followed by clinical coaching. Context: Using direct-observations and a previously published checklist for rounds leadership, this study sought to evaluate the workplace behavior change for novice residents leading inpatient teams for the first time. We conducted a prospective cohort study (March 2016 and August 2018) of internal medicine residents at a large tertiary academic medical center in Boston, MA. Trained faculty raters performed direct observations of clinical rounding experiences using the checklist and compared the findings to historical and internal controls. Questionnaires were distributed pre- and post- curriculum to assess satisfaction and readiness to lead a team. Impact: We trained 65 PGY1 residents and raters conducted 140 direct observations − 36 in the intervention group and 104 among historical controls. The unadjusted mean score in rounds leadership skills for the intervention group was 19.0 (SD = 5.1) compared to 16.2 (SD = 6.2) for historical controls. Adjusting for repeated measures, we found significant improvement in mean scores for behaviors linked to the curricular objectives (p = 0.008) but not for general behaviors not covered by the curriculum (p = 0.2). Lessons Learned: A formal curriculum to train residents as leaders led to behavior change in the workplace in domains essential to rounds leadership. We also found that the curriculum was highly regarded in that all interns indicated they would recommend the curriculum to a peer. Moreover, the program may have assuaged some anxiety during the transition to junior year as 90% of interns surveyed felt more ready to start PGY2 year than historical trainings. We learned that while a robust, multi-faceted modular curriculum and clinical coaching successfully resulted in behavior change, the resources required to manage this program are significant and difficult to sustain. Future iterations could include asynchronous material and potentially peer-observation of rounds leadership to reduce the burden on faculty and program curricular time. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122874622"

However, little attention has been paid to how fulfillment of medical students’ basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) impacts their capacity to be mindful and cope with stress. Self-Determination Theory (SDT) posits that mindfulness facilitates adaptive coping and wellness, in large part because of need fulfillment. Hypotheses: Using SDT as a lens, it is hypothesized that medical students’ resilience and, to a greater extent, need fulfillment in medical school, will mediate the relationship between their mindfulness and coping reactions to stress. Method: One-hundred-ninety-seven medical students from the University of Saskatchewan were recruited to participate in this study: 71 first year, 58 second year, and 36 third and fourth year, each. Students completed an anonymous survey, measuring need fulfillment in medical school, mindfulness, resilience, and frequent use of various adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies. We assessed the extent that need fulfillment and resilience mediated the relationship between mindfulness and coping styles. Results: Need satisfaction and resilience fully mediated the relationship between mindfulness and adaptive coping. Conversely, need frustration and resilience partially mediated the relationship between mindfulness and maladaptive coping. Need fulfillment was a stronger mediator than resilience in both coping models. Conclusions: Findings suggest that increased supports for medical students’ resilience and basic psychological needs may promote their mindfulness, and in turn, their ability to respond more adaptively and less maladaptively to stressors they face in medical school. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113905498"

Findings: Regarding IAT results, 7% of medical students preferred “fat over thin,” 14% had no preference, and 78% preferred “thin over fat.” Reflection themes highlighted medical students’ difficulty accepting IAT results, perspectives on the origins of obesity in individuals, personal and family challenges with obesity and body image, medical training’s perceived influence on bias, reservations about discussing obesity with patients, and desires to change current and future practices. Insights: Many medical students expressed a desire to provide optimal care for patients of all weight classes despite demonstrating a strong unconscious bias against individuals with obesity on the IAT. Medical school should provide targeted opportunities to acknowledge and mitigate obesity bias by expanding on medical students’ pre-established and often harmful understandings of obesity and highlighting the complexities of this disease. Such training would better equip medical students to facilitate successful interactions with patients as future physicians. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126046386"

This task can be further complicated by errors of judgment, with the failure to consider all possible diagnoses being the most common of such errors. In this study, we investigated the process of differential diagnosis generation within the growing evidence that diagnostic performance can be increased by activities such as walking as was previously shown in Oppezzo and Schwartz’s 2014 study. Hypotheses: It was hypothesized that an increase in performance, as expressed by a greater number of plausible differential diagnoses, would be seen in the walking group. Method: Eighteen medical students in their last two months of pre-clerkship training and eighteen second year family medicine residents were shown four different lists of a constellation of signs and symptoms. Participants were asked to generate differential diagnoses over five minutes per each list. All participants sat when completing the first two lists (pretest phase), and then were equally and randomly assigned to sitting versus walking on a treadmill when completing the last two lists (post-test phase). The number of total and unique differential diagnoses generated was determined, before being submitted to a three-member expert panel who identified appropriate unique differential diagnoses. Results: Two-way mixed ANOVAs were conducted to investigate the impact of exercise on the number of total, unique, and appropriate unique ideas generated and compared between pretest and post-test phases. Conclusions: We conclude that there is neither an increase nor a decrease in the number or quality of differential diagnoses generated by the sitting and walking groups within a population that has acquired some level of expertise. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112649763"

Little is known about experiences of residents, who are further along in their physician identity formation and have greater autonomy and competence. We explored and characterized how residents understand their experiences of the phenomenon of feeling negative emotions toward patients in relation to their identities as residents. Approach: In 2018, 305 final-year obstetrics and gynecology residents were invited to participate in interviews, which we conducted until reaching theoretical sufficiency. In semi-structured interviews conducted by phone, we probed interactions when residents felt negative emotions toward patients, including reasons for their feelings related to their professional identities, strategies, and curricular desires. The authors coded data and identified patterns using thematic analysis. Findings: Nineteen residents were interviewed by phone. Residents experienced negative emotions toward patients because of challenges to their identities as: physicians–wanting respect and specific unexpected patient behaviors; learners–desiring complete autonomy and experiencing challenges with attending physicians; teachers–wanting to be a role model and protect junior learners; and workers–trying to complete tasks. Among the strategies used to manage feelings toward patients, they struggled with “venting”, or complaining about patients, which was not always helpful and residents recognized as perceived negatively by students. They desired curricular support for these interactions such as debriefs and other supported reflection, faculty modeling, and communication skills training. Insights: Like medical students and physicians in practice, residents experience negative emotions toward patients, often because of and made more difficult by their identities as physicians, learners, teachers, and workers. Educators should support residents’ reflections about these interactions, model compassionate behavior when feeling challenged by patients, and address unhealthy coping strategies. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119213739"

This thematic analysis aimed to bridge the gap between theory and practice by drawing on the experiences of international leaders and educators of compassion training programs to develop a clear understanding of what is relevant and effective and how compassion training is implemented and sustained. Approach: International leaders and educators of compassion training programs (N = 15) were identified through convenience sampling based on academic and gray literature searches. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews with these participants were conducted between June 2020 and November 2020 in order to identify facilitators, barriers, and environmental conditions influencing the implementation and maintenance of compassion training programs. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings: Six categories affecting the operationalization of compassion training programs were identified 1) origins, foundational principles and purpose, 2) curricular content, 3) methods of teaching and learning, 4) trainer qualities, 5) challenges and facilitators, and 6) evaluation and impact. Insights: Compassion training should be rooted in the construct of interest and incorporate patients’ needs and their experience of compassion, with patient-reported compassion scores integrated before and after training. Compassion training should be delivered by highly qualified educators who have an understanding of the challenges associated with integrating compassion into clinical practice, a dedicated contemplative practice, and a compassionate presence in the classroom. Prior to implementing compassion training, leadership support should be secured to create an ethos of compassion throughout the organization. © 2022 The Author(s).

Descriptive, first-person accounts of patient experiences can reveal new and unique insights. These insights can inform renewed approaches to medical education and practice. However, comparatively little research has been done on the other side of the clinical encounter. This leaves the lived experiences of doctors diagnosing and treating illness unaddressed and the ontological transformation of medical students through medical education unexplored. Evidence: This paper provides a phenomenological description of the clinical encounter and ontological transformation of the medical student into the doctor. I argue doctors have a unique ontology, rooted in the objectification of the patient, for which I use the term being-opposite-illness This is achieved, through phenomenological examination of my experiences as a medical student and through descriptions of three distinct types of face-to-face encounters: the basic encounter with the Other, the encounter with illness, and the clinical encounter, which I argue are all metaphysically distinct. Finally, textual analysis of popular first-person accounts from two doctors, Henry Marsh and Paul Kalanithi, provide an illustration of being-opposite-illness in clinical practice and how this ontological transformation occurs through medical education. Implications: Together, the phenomenology of the clinical encounter and textual analysis of Marsh and Kalanithi reveal clinical practice and medical education be an ontological transformative process. This paper attempts a new understanding of this experience of doctors by accounting for their unique ontology. In sum, I suggest being-opposite-illness can represent a new lens for analyzing the experience of doctors. Through this, I hope to promote new medical education and practice approaches. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136179194"

Data demonstrating the impact of longitudinal coaching programs are needed. Intervention: We developed and evaluated a comprehensive longitudinal medical student coaching program designed to achieve three aims for students: fostering personal and professional development, advancing physician skills with a growth mindset, and promoting student wellbeing and belonging within an inclusive learning community. We also sought to advance coaches’ development as faculty through satisfying education roles with structured training. Students meet with coaches weekly for the first 17 months of medical school for patient care and health systems skills learning, and at least twice yearly throughout the remainder of medical school for individual progress and planning meetings and small-group discussions about professional identity. Using the developmental evaluation framework, we iteratively evaluated the program over the first five years of implementation with multiple quantitative and qualitative measures of students’ and coaches’ experiences related to the three aims. Context: The University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine, developed a longitudinal coaching program in 2016 for medical students alongside reform of the four-year curriculum. The coaching program addressed unmet student needs for a longitudinal, non-evaluative relationship with a coach to support their development, shape their approach to learning, and promote belonging and community. Impact: In surveys and focus groups, students reported high satisfaction with coaching in measures of the three program aims. They appreciated coaches’ availability and guidance for the range of academic, personal, career, and other questions they had throughout medical school. Students endorsed the value of a longitudinal relationship and coaches’ ability to meet their changing needs over time. Students rated coaches’ teaching of foundational clinical skills highly. Students observed coaches learning some clinical skills with them–skills outside a coach’s daily practice. Students also raised some concerns about variability among coaches. Attention to wellbeing and belonging to a learning community were program highlights for students. Coaches benefited from relationships with students and other coaches and welcomed the professional development to equip them to support all student needs. Lessons Learned: Students perceive that a comprehensive medical student coaching program can achieve aims to promote their development and provide support. Within a non-evaluative longitudinal coach relationship, students build skills in driving their own learning and improvement. Coaches experience a satisfying yet challenging role. Ongoing faculty development within a coach community and funding for the role seem essential for coaches to fulfill their responsibilities. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136517554"

Critical theory refers both to a “school of thought” and a process of critique that reveals the dynamic forces impacting minoritized groups and individuals. Critical theory can be helpful when researchers want to examine or expose social structures for their asymmetrical power differentials, and subsequently act upon them to create change. Evidence: However, despite the repeated calls for more critical work in medical education, merely describing critical theory’s school of thought has not forwarded researchers’ engagement with these theories. Presently, critical analyses remain rare in medical education. One potential reason for the lack of critical analyses is that there is little guidance for how researchers might engage with their data and approach their findings. Implications: In this paper, we go beyond merely describing critical theory and demonstrate how critical theory can be used as an analytic approach to interrogate the experiences of minoritized individuals in medical education. Using three critical theories: critical race theory, feminist theory, and postcolonial theory, we provide an illustration of how researchers might approach their data using one of three critical theories. In doing so, we hope to assist researchers in better understanding the utility of critical analyses to illuminate sociohistorical forces at work within medical education. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110900594"

The placement of the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 after the core clerkships is one strategy intended to facilitate cognitive integration, though learner experiences with this model are unexplored. The purpose of this study is to understand students’ perspectives on basic and clinical science integration in a post-clerkship Step 1 curriculum. Approach: Focus groups were conducted between August and September 2020 with senior medical students from the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine and University of Michigan Medical School. Data were analyzed using a constructivist approach to thematic analysis. Findings: Thirty-three students participated in six focus groups. Participants described multiple barriers to cognitive integration in the clerkship learning environment, though they also identified examples of teaching and learning that facilitated integration. Early in their clerkships, students struggled to integrate because of their tenuous basic science foundation, cognitive overload, and difficulty perceiving the relevance of basic science to patient care. They felt that educators primarily focused on clinical science, and many basic science teaching sessions during clerkships felt irrelevant to patient care. However, students also described experiences that made the connection between basic and clinical science more explicit, including modeling by educators and clerkship learning activities that more overtly encouraged the application of basic science to clinical care. In addition, the return to basic science studying during the post-clerkship dedicated Step 1 study period offered powerful integration opportunities. These facilitators of cognitive integration helped students recognize the value of integration for enduring learning. Insights: There are myriad barriers to cognitive integration of basic and clinical science during clerkships in a post-clerkship Step 1 curriculum. The relevance of basic science to patient care needs to be made more explicit to students through modeling by clinician educators to augment the potential benefits of curricular change. The post-clerkship Step 1 study period appears to offer a unique opportunity for cognitive integration later in a learner’s trajectory that may be related to curricular design. When learners recognize the applicability of basic science to patient care, they may more intentionally transfer basic science knowledge to clinical practice. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124936712"

As the next generation of health care providers, undergraduate health professional students play a pivotal role in caring for dementia patients during their clinical placements and in independent practice. Nevertheless, they may not be adequately prepared to care for patients with dementia by their undergraduate programs. Measuring the knowledge and attitudes of health professional students could be an important step in providing evidence regarding the need to enhance dementia care training in the curriculum. Approach: Responses from 325 Chinese health professional (nursing, medical, and public health) students were included in the analyses. After providing informed consent, students answered questionnaires including a demographic data questionnaire, the Alzheimer’s Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS) and the Dementia Attitudes Scale (DAS). Univariate analyses were performed to test the association between outcomes and potential explanatory variables. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the predictive factors for knowledge and attitudes toward dementia. Findings: Chinese health professional students had a mean ADKS score of 18.92 (SD = 3.20). Better knowledge was associated with advanced education, having family members with medical knowledge, having heard of dementia, and having interest in learning about dementia. Students had a mean DAS score of 89.10 (SD = 8.93), and their attitudes were significantly associated with majoring in public health and having heard of dementia. Students’ knowledge was positively, but weakly related with attitudes (r = 0.122, P = 0.028). Insights: Chinese undergraduate health professional students demonstrate insufficient knowledge and less positive attitudes toward dementia than their counterparts in developed countries. Enhanced dementia care-specific curriculum and training are urgently needed in China to meet the growing demand for dementia care services. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115687337"

Presently, no widely accepted guidelines exist for educators to assess learners and evaluate programs regarding social determinants of health (SDOH) during physician and physician assistant (PA) education. We sought to garner expert consensus about effective SDOH learner assessment and program evaluation, so as to make recommendations for best practices related to SDOH education. Approach: We used a Delphi approach to conduct our study (September 2019 to December 2020). To administer our Delphi survey, we followed a three-step process: 1) literature review, 2) focus groups and semi-structured interviews, 3) question development and refinement. The final survey contained 72 items that addressed SDOH content areas, assessment methods, assessors, assessment integration, and program evaluation. Survey participants included 14 SDOH experts at US medical schools and PA programs. The survey was circulated for three rounds seeking consensus, and when respondents reached consensus on a particular question, that question was removed from subsequent rounds. Findings: The geographically diverse sample of experts reached consensus on many aspects of SDOH assessment and evaluation. The experts selected three important areas to assess learners’ knowledge, skills, and attitudes about SDOH. They identified assessment methods that were “essential”, “useful, but not essential”, and “not necessary.” The essential assessment methods are performance rating scales for knowledge and attitudes and skill-based assessments. They favored faculty and patients as assessors, as well as learner self-assessment, over assessments conducted by other health professionals. Questions about separation versus incorporation of SDOH assessment with other educational assessment did not yield consensus opinion. The experts reached consensus on priority outcome measures to evaluate a school’s SDOH program which included student attitudes toward SDOH, Competence-Based Assessment Scales, and the percentage of graduates involved in health equity initiatives. Insights: Based on the Delphi survey results, we make five recommendations that medical and PA educators can apply now when designing learner assessments and evaluating SDOH programming. These recommendations include what should be assessed, using what methods, who should do the assessments, and how they should be incorporated into the curriculum. This expert consensus should guide future development of an assessment and evaluation toolkit to optimize SDOH education and clinical practice.

Culturally responsive communication (CRC) is a vital tool health professionals can use to address these inequities. Yet, CRC can be challenging to teach, particularly during pandemics. The authors argue that pandemics magnify the powerful intersecting oppressions of heterosexism, racism, transphobia, nationalism, and sexism, essentially targeting Othered bodies for dying, a phenomenon known as necropolitics. Evidence: Five aspects of pandemics make teaching CRC more difficult and, because of the magnification of necropolitics, more critical. First, pandemics heighten teachers’ and learners’ personal frailties, engendering worries about their own and their families’ health and increasing cognitive load. This can make it difficult for them to embrace the discomfort required of CRC, particularly when an increased patient load is squeezing instructional time. Second, guidelines for HIV and COVID-19 testing, prevention, and treatment are ever-changing, often faster than the pace of curriculum development and instructor professional development. Third, for instructors who may already be stretched thin, it is challenging to prepare learners for the variability in how their future practice contexts may address HIV and COVID-19 and, further, how to take a social justice approach to assess and resist the distinct equity issues of each of these contexts. Fourth, pandemics cause uncertain access to patient information about testing, disease status, and vaccination or pre-exposure prophylaxis. This worsens already disparate outcomes for minoritized patients and adds to the complexity of CRC curricula. Finally, virtual care is more prevalent in pandemics and teaching CRC in online contexts can be difficult. Implications: To address these challenges, we adopt the Dimensionality and R4P Health Equity Framework as a tool for evaluating academic programs for CRC so that it remains robust amidst pandemics. This tool addresses the varied social positions and identities (i.e., “dimensions”) that present different opportunities for health. We offer specific evaluation questions programs can ask and approaches they can take to (a) redress past harms through removing existing racist, heteronormative and transphobic structures and repairing the damage they have done; (b) plan for a more equitable future by restructuring via policy and organizational change and providing programs that address intersectional disadvantage; and (c) critically evaluate the present by remediating current damage immediately until restructuring efforts are fully functional. As Martin Luther King, Jr. stated, “Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in healthcare is the most shocking and inhuman because it often results in physical death.” It is our imperative to teach CRC with intentionality; otherwise we will support necropolitics as we continue to condone disproportionate morbidity and mortality for racialized and queer bodies. © 2023 The Author(s).

Holistic review of this many applications is challenging, and to-date, few tools exist to streamline or assist in the process for selecting candidates to interview and rank. Machine learning could assist programs in predicting which applicants are likely to be ranked, and among ranked applicants, which are likely to matriculate. Approach: In the present study, we used the machine learning algorithm Random Forest (RF) to differentiate between ranked and unranked applicants as well as matriculants and ranked non-matriculants to an internal medicine residency program in northern New England over a three-year period. In total, 5,067 ERAS applications were received during the 2016-17, 2017-18, and 2018-19 application cycles. Of these, 4,256 (84.0%) were unranked applicants, 754 (14.9%) were ranked non-matriculants, and 57 (1.12%) were ranked matriculants. Findings: For differentiating between ranked and unranked applicants, the RF algorithm achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.925 (95% CI: 0.918-0.932) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.652 (0.611-0.685), while for differentiating between matriculants and ranked non-matriculants, the AUROC was 0.597 (95% CI: 0.516-0.680) and AUPRC was 0.114 (0.075-0.167). The ranks of matriculated applicants were significantly higher using the algorithmic rank list as compared with the actual rank list for the 2017-18 (median rank: 98 versus 204, p <.001) and 2018-19 cycles (74 versus 192, p =.006), but not the 2016-17 cycle (97 versus 144, p =.37). Insights: The RF algorithm predicted which applicants among the overall applicant pool were ranked with impressive accuracy and identified matriculants among ranked candidates with modest but better-than-random accuracy. This approach could assist residency programs with triaging applicants based on the likelihood of a candidate being ranked and/or matriculating. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130871784"

Intervention: A four-session Narrative Medicine (NM) anti-racism program was designed for medical school faculty using critical race theory, phenomenology, and NM methods. Each workshop consisted of a lecture on key NM concepts and a small-group breakout session incorporating group discussion, close reading, and reflective writing. Context: This NM anti-racism program was developed and implemented in April 2021 by two medical students for faculty at an institution in the southeastern U.S. The program was supported by the Office of Inclusive Excellence at the institution and held in collaboration with the institution’s medical education teaching academy. Program evaluation consisted of pre- and post-program surveys, which queried participants’ previous experiences with DEI and medical humanities programs, perceptions of self-identity and privilege, and confidence in teaching concepts of anti-racism. Of the total program participants (n = 32), 19 completed both surveys (54.3%). Survey data were analyzed using bivariate testing methods and qualitative thematic analysis. Impact: Post-program surveys showed 13 (68.4%) participants felt “somewhat more” or “more” comfortable engaging in concepts of race, and 12 (63.2%) participants felt “somewhat more” or “more” comfortable including topics of race into their teaching compared to before the program. Five themes were generated following qualitative analysis: (1) the value of longitudinal narrative reflection in a small-group setting for DEI work; (2) desire to commit more time to DEI, anti-racist, and social justice work while balancing busy teaching and clinical schedules; (3) the value of storytelling in DEI and anti-racism programming; (4) an understanding of deconstructive and reconstructive work of anti-racism in medicine; and (5) an increased ability to educate and enact change through teaching, activism, and institutional cultural and policy changes. Lessons Learned: This novel NM DEI training for medical school faculty was successful in increasing comfort discussing and teaching concepts of race in the medical school classroom, while providing a uniquely reflective space for personal growth. Participation in this longitudinal reflective experience was limited by physician schedules, therefore efforts to make time to participate in similar longitudinal interventions must be undertaken. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130983853"

However, medical schools have little guidance for operationalizing and applying this concept in practice. This study explored institutional practices and administrative perceptions of social accountability in medical education. Approach: An online survey was distributed to a purposeful sample of English-speaking undergraduate medical school deans and program directors/leads from 245 institutions in 14 countries. The survey comprised of 38-items related to program mission statements, admission processes, curricular content, and educational outcomes. Survey items were developed using previous literature and categorized using a context-input-process-products (CIPP) evaluation model. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was used to assess the inter-relationship among survey items. Reliability and internal consistency of items were evaluated using McDonald’s Omega. Findings: Results from 81 medical schools in 14 countries collected between February and June 2020 are presented. Institutional commonalities of social accountability were observed. However, our findings suggest programs focus predominately on educational inputs and processes, and not necessarily on outcomes. Findings from our EFA demonstrated excellent internal consistency and reliability. Four-factors were extracted: (1) selection and recruitment; (2) institutional mandates; (3) institutional activities; and (4) community awareness, accounting for 71% of the variance. McDonald’s Omega reliability estimates for subscales ranged from 0.80-0.87. Insights: This study identified common practices of social accountability. While many medical schools expressed an institutional commitment to social accountability, their effects on the community remain unknown and not evaluated. Overall, this paper offers programs and educators a psychometrically supported tool to aid in the operationalization and reliability of evaluating social accountability. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, these attempts to foster SRL are not always successful. Evidence: We considered complexities related to fostering self-regulated learning by use of an analogy. This analogy was based on two (Dutch) children’s games: the treasure hunt (children can find a “treasure” by following directions, completing assignments and/or answering questions) and the dropping (pre-teens are dropped in the woods at nighttime with the assignment to find their way back home). We formulated four interrelated philosophical questions. These questions were not formulated with the intention to provide clear-cut answers, but were instead meant to evoke contemplation about the SRL concept. During this contemplation, the implications of definitional issues regarding SRL were discussed by use of the first question: What are the consequences of the difficulties to explicate what is (not) SRL? The second question (How does SRL relate to autonomy?) touched upon the intricate relationship between SRL and autonomy, by discussing the role of social interaction and varying degrees of instruction when fostering SRL. Next, a related topic was addressed by the third question: How much risk are we willing and able to take when fostering SRL? And finally, the importance of and possibilities to assess SRL were discussed by the fourth question (Should SRL be assessed?). Implications: From our contemplations it has become clear that approaches to foster SRL are often insufficiently aligned with the experience and needs of learners. Instead these approaches are commonly defined by contextual factors, such as misconceptions about SRL and lack of leeway for learners. Consequently, we have used principles that apply to both treasure hunts and droppings, to provide guidelines on how to align one’s approach to foster SRL with the educational context and experience and needs of learners. © 2023 The Author(s).

Yet research on the factors that affect compassion and compassion-related constructs remains scattered. This review systematizes and synthesizes studies investigating the predictors of compassion and related constructs among medical students, allowing for a better understanding of the factors that both positively and negatively contribute to the development of compassionate future physicians. Approach: A systematic review of 12 databases for studies from database inception up until April 2020 was conducted. Non–peer-reviewed literature and studies in which >50% of the sample were non-medical students were excluded. Intervention studies were also out of the scope of this review. We assessed risk of bias and confidence in the findings using standardized tools. Data were categorized within the Transactional Model of Physician Compassion, a framework in which compassion is influenced by personal (student), environmental, patient/family, and clinical factors. Findings: Of 14,060 retrieved articles, 222 studies were included. Of these, 95% studied student factors, but only 25% studied environmental, 9% studied patient, and 6% studied clinical factors. Predictors of greater compassion included maturity; work and life experiences; personality traits of openness to experience and agreeableness; skills such as perspective taking, reflection, and mindfulness; and positive role modeling. Conversely, negative attitudes/emotions, burnout, stress, detachment, operating in cultures prioritizing knowledge and efficiency over humanistic care, negative role models, time constraints, and heavy workloads predicted lower compassion. Patient-related factors included “difficult” and “noncompliant” patients or those perceived as responsible for their illness. Overall, 60% of studies had a serious risk of bias, particularly confounding and participant selection biases. Insights: Medical student compassion is predicted by a wide range of factors relating to the student, their training environment, their patients, and the clinical situation. However, existing research has largely focused on student factors (e.g., sociodemographic and dispositional traits), many of which are not amenable to intervention. Skills such as perspective taking, reflection, and mindfulness are associated with higher compassion and may present opportunities for intervention. There is also strong evidence that environmental factors shape students’ compassion. Researchers and educators should continue to explore the impact of patient and clinical factors on students’ compassion.

Many studies on empathic communication show mixed results and are often hindered and skewed by brief study lengths, insufficiently and ambiguously defined concepts, and limited methods for objective measurements. Intervention: The FAN Curriculum is a unique communication curriculum, based on the conceptual frameworks of patient-centered communication, reflective practice, mindfulness, and attunement using the Facilitating Attuned Interactions (FAN) model. The first part of the FAN Curriculum was delivered as a 3-hour interactive workshop involving didactics, group discussion, and role play with pediatric residents. Residents then completed weekly self-reflections, a follow-up one-hour training to reinforce concepts, and five monthly mentor sessions, all emphasizing reflective practice. Context: This longitudinal, mixed-methods study examined the effects of the FAN Curriculum on residents’ empathy levels and ability to communicate with parents in the clinical setting. The study was conducted at two urban, academic, medium-sized pediatric residency programs in Chicago between October 2016 and November 2017. First- and second-year pediatric residents whose continuity clinic site was located at their home institution participated. Residents received training in the use of the FAN Communication Tool using a delayed-start crossover study design. Impact: At five time points, residents and parents completed instruments validated for measuring physician empathy and mindfulness. Post-study interviews were conducted for one institution’s residents and mentors and were evaluated using open and focused coding. Participants (n = 23) demonstrated a high degree of use of the FAN Communication Tool six months post-training and a significant rise in self-reported comfort with four of five FAN core processes. One parent-completed survey (Consultation and Relational Empathy, CARE) showed a statistically significant rise of 3.26% in resident relational empathy and collaboration after training (p = 0.02). In qualitative analysis of interviews, residents and mentors found the FAN Communication Tool beneficial, making clinic visits more efficient and collaborative. Both groups noted improvement in the residents’ relationship-building skills; residents were able to use enhanced communication skills to better approach challenging encounters and work through parent concerns. Lessons Learned: Family-centered communication training can improve physician-perceived empathy and mindfulness. Effective communication for pediatric residents incorporates an empathic approach, and introduction to this formal curriculum supported their growth in connecting and engaging with children and parents. The FAN Curriculum may provide a useful method for improving resident communication skills with a positive impact on pediatricians’ collaboration with patients and families. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135843386"

Educator development is thus the focus of many LMIC programs initiated by universities and governments of high income countries. While signs of medical educator professionalization such as postgraduate qualifications, specialized units, and professional associations have emerged in LMIC, whether these relate to programs originating from outside LMIC contexts is unknown. This study investigated the contextual influences on the long-term impact of an international faculty development program a decade after its delivery in a LMIC context–Vietnam. Approach: Ten years after an international aid program to develop clinical skills teaching expertise in Vietnam, we conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with eight medical educators from all eight participating medical schools. Selected for their leadership potential, each participant had completed the Maastricht Masters in Health Professions Education during the program. Interview transcripts underwent thematic analysis, using the Theory of Practice Architectures as a conceptual lens to highlight the contextual influences on professional practice. Findings: Four themes were identified: Careers and Practices before, during, and after the program, Unrecognized and Unseen practice, Structural Restraints on individual advancement and collective activity, and the Cultivation of Connections through social traditions. Participants reported being in well-established teaching delivery roles. However, the absence of professionalizing discourses and material resources meant that practice was restricted and determined by institutional leadership and individuals’ adaptations. Insights: Informed by the theory of practice architectures, we found that change in medical education practice will falter in contexts that lack supporting discursive, material-economic, and socio-political arrangements. While there were emerging signs of individual agency, the momentum of change was not sustained and perhaps unapparent to Western framings of educational leadership. Practice architectures offers a framework for identifying the contextual features which influence practice, from which to design and deliver sustainable and impactful interventions, and to advance context-relevant evaluation and research. Our findings suggest that faculty development delivered across diverse contexts, such as in distributed or transnational medical programs, may have more effect if informed by a practice architectures analysis of each context. © 2022 The Author(s).

The process of being physically exposed in the presence of colleagues can be uncomfortable and cause students distress for myriad reasons ranging from religious and cultural practices to body dysmorphia and previous trauma experiences. This is especially problematic in educational systems which offer no other options, or make PPE a requirement of the curriculum. Evidence: Across all U.S. medical schools, trainees spent a median of 59 hours teaching physical examination skills. Of this time, 30% is dedicated to PPE practice. Despite this prevalence, there are data that show some students find this uncomfortable, especially women. Literature on best practices around PPE highlights voluntary participation, informed consent, and an available alternative to learning physical xamination skills. These are not uniformly available in all learning environments. There are little data around the impact of PPE on students who have experienced or are experiencing sexual trauma. Authors have drawn conclusions about the potential for harm given the prevalence of sexual mistreatment in US higher education. Implications: Our medical school policy required students to participate in PPE practice, undressing for the exams wearing only shorts (and a sports bra for women) an and a hospital gown. Students who could not participate in this practice for reasons ranging from mobility to religious beliefs had to seek individual formal accommodations to be exempt, putting the onus of change on potentially vulnerable individuals. We evaluated the policy around PPE, and concluded that the school’s requirements could be harmful and isolating, as they required students to disclose their personal vulnerabilities while seeking exemptions from being examined by peers. At our institution, a group of students instead advocated for the school to review the policy and create a PPE procedure that was safer and more inclusive while supporting student learning. Our experience emphasized the potential for students to advocate for change, while also highlighting the need for greater research in the field of trauma-informed curricular design for medical education. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183013931"

Phenomenology refers to a philosophical tradition or discipline. For researchers in Health Professions Education without a philosophical or humanities background, there are two practical problems. The first is that it is not always clear how studies that call themselves “phenomenological” are distinct from studies that use other methods; phenomenology as a label seems to be used for any study that is interested in the experiences of participants. The second problem is that a more in-depth study of phenomenology in the literature yields either abstract definitions such as “examining the underlying structures of consciousness,” or contrasting translations of phenomenology to concrete research tools. What would phenomenology in medical education research look like that is both true to its philosophical roots and yields research findings that contribute to the quality of medical education? Evidence: Two medical education researchers, one with a medical background and the other with a philosophy background, engaged in a dialogue with the purpose of formulating an approach for phenomenology in medical education research. The first departed from the practical demands of his research project in which phenomenology was suggested as a methodology, but guidance was lacking. The other departed from the philosophical tradition of phenomenology with the purpose of exploring how phenomenological insights can be valuable for medical education research. The paper presents these journeys and the results of this dialogue where they formulate starting points for an approach to conducting HPE research that has scientific phenomenological integrity and yields practical results. Implications: Phenomenology has been one of the defining developments in philosophy and the humanities in the 20th century. A basic grasp of its insights is useful for medical education researchers since any research today takes place in the light of these insights. Within medical education, there are certain types of phenomena, research questions, and research goals that call for an explicitly phenomenological approach. Rather than prescribing specific methods or methodologies, phenomenology offers signposts for how to think about the relationship between our research object, methods, and data, and our own role as researchers. We suggest that researchers in HPE, when reporting a phenomenological study, instead of claiming to have followed a certain phenomenological method, explain how their research question, methods, and results fit the purposes and standards of phenomenology. We illustrate this with an example of how to use phenomenology in an interview study. © 2021 The Author(s).

Educating medical students on how to teach can improve their own learning and lay the foundation for a professional identity rooted in teaching. Still, medical student-as-teacher (MSAT) programs face numerous obstacles including time constraints, prioritizing curriculum, and determining effective evaluation techniques. The purpose of this scoping review is to map the current landscape of the literature on medical school initiatives designed to train students to teach to describe why medical student teaching programs are started; the benefits and barriers; who teaches them; what content is taught; and how content is delivered. With this new map, the authors aimed to facilitate the growth of new programs and provide a shared knowledge of practices derived from existing programs. Approach: The authors conducted a scoping review, guided by Arksey and O’Malley’s framework, to map the literature of MSAT training programs. Six databases were searched using combinations of keywords and controlled vocabulary terms. Data were charted in duplicate using a collaboratively designed data charting tool. This review builds on the Marton et al. review and includes articles published from 2014 to 2020. Findings: Of the 1,644 manuscripts identified, the full-text of 57 were reviewed, and ultimately 27 were included. Articles included empirical research, synthetic reviews, opinion pieces, and a descriptive study. Analysis focused on modalities for teaching medical students how to teach; content to teach medical students about teaching; benefits and barriers to starting teaching programs; and the value of teaching programs for medical students. Insights: The rapid growth of MSAT programs suggests that this curricular offering is of great interest to the field. Literature shows an increase in evaluative efforts among programs, benefits for students beyond learning to teach, and evidence of effective engagement in medical students’ designing and implementing programs. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116569669"

To achieve safe, effective health care for culturally and linguistically diverse patients, the medical profession needs clear standards for physician language use and proven culture and language training models that include validated assessment of linguistic proficiency. InterventionThe authors describe the first decade of an innovative culture and language coaching program for bilingual (Spanish-English) pediatric residents, including the model’s evolution and outcomes, as well as recommendations for implementing similar programs elsewhere. Over 10 years, the model has grown from a central innovation—the professional culture and language coach (CLC). The CLC provides 1:1 in-visit support and post-visit coaching to individual residents during three years of continuity clinic experience in a Spanish-language setting (Clínica Hispana de Cuidados de Salud—CHiCoS). They also provide a range of supplementary learning activities (e.g., simulations, immersion rotations, mock testing) and periodic formal assessment of language proficiency. Foundational program elements include cultural and linguistic humility, variations in language, pragmatic linguistics and trans-languaging, the inseparability of culture and language, health literacy, and a flat teaching hierarchy (“all teach, all learn”). ContextCHiCoS has been implemented continuously since 2009 in the primary care clinic of a stand-alone academic pediatric hospital in the Midwest, where pediatric residents have their continuity clinic experience over three years of residency. ImpactFifty-six residents have participated, reporting improved language skills, cultural knowledge, and ability to care for Spanish-speaking patients. Sixty-eight percent of residents not qualified bilingual upon program entry passed a validated physician language assessment by graduation. Spanish-speaking patients seen by CHiCoS residents and faculty reported higher satisfaction, trust, and communication scores than those seen in non-bilingual areas of the same clinic (p <.05 for all scores). The program increased bilingual faculty six-fold and changed attitudes and practices related to language supports throughout the residency program. Lessons LearnedCulture and language coaching provides effective preparation and assessment of bilingual physicians, leading to improved care for culturally and linguistically diverse patients. Our model offers an example for developing similar approaches for a variety of clinicians throughout health care. Such approaches should include professional standards for non-English language use, training supports customized to bilingual learners’ proficiency levels, and a focus on integrating practical cultural and linguistic skills to achieve safe, effective clinical communication. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133272823"

In this article, the authors do not reject the value of reflection for medical education and medical practitioners, but they still ask why reflection can (potentially) yield so many different benefits, and what that implies for the status of reflection in medical education practice. Evidence: Based on a conceptual analysis of debates about reflection in the philosophical tradition, the authors argue that there are two quintessential gaps that play a role in the proliferation of (potential) benefits. First, reflection deals with bridging the gap between theory and practice; second, it deals with bridging the gap between the individual sense and communal sense. These gaps prevent the systematization of reflection, and they are fundamental to human thinking and experience in any situated environment, which led contemporary research on reflection to list a wide variety of benefits. Implications: The authors argue that if reflection resists systematization, it cannot be learned by following rules or protocols, but only practiced. Then, reflection should no longer be taught and researched as an individual skill one learns, nor as a means to some particular, beneficial end. Rather, one should practice reflection, and experience what it means to be part of a community wherein professionals jump the theory–practice gap constantly in a myriad of situations. Based on their analysis, the authors provide three concrete recommendations for reflection in medical education. First, to give precedence to reflective activities that encompass both gaps wherein situated examples can flourish; second, to use reflective guidelines as sources of inspiration; third, to show reserve about assessing reflection. © 2022 The Author(s).

Despite widespread efforts to reduce student burnout through wellness programming in medical schools, there is a paucity of literature examining students’ perception of wellness and engagement with these programs. As such, we sought to evaluate: 1) medical students’ level of engagement with a multifaceted wellness curriculum, 2) factors students perceived as important to wellbeing, and 3) associations with longitudinal measures of wellbeing and perceived stress. Intervention: A multipronged wellness curriculum was instituted at Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine-AZ (MCASOM-AZ) in 2017. This includes mental health services, curriculum-embedded seminars, wellness committee (composed of students, faculty, and administration) driven programming, and student proposed wellness activities that are reviewed and funded by the committee. The authors invited students at our institution to complete questionnaires at three timepoints during the 2018–2019 academic year. Questionnaires asked participants to rank eight factors from least to most important to their overall wellbeing. Participants self-reported their participation in each prong of the wellness curriculum and ranked the impact of each on their overall wellbeing. Their wellbeing and perceived stress were measured at each timepoint using validated psychological instruments. Context: As MCASOM-AZ opened in 2017, the student body at the time of study consisted of first- and second-year medical students. All students had the opportunity to engage with all aspects of the wellness curriculum and participate in this study, however participation was elective and all responses were anonymous. Of the MCASOM-AZ student body comprised of 100 students, 58 consented to participate in the study, 41.4% of which were Year 1 and 58.6% of which were Year 2 students. Participant age and gender were collected and were representative of the larger student body. Impact: Students engaged most with student-initiated wellness. They perceived unscheduled time as most impactful to their overall wellbeing with student-initiated activities as second-most impactful. Students with higher perceived stress were more likely than others to use mental health resources, which otherwise ranked lower in importance. Ranking academic performance as important to wellbeing was associated with higher wellbeing. There was no difference in wellbeing between students who participated in the wellness curriculum and those who did not. However, overall student wellbeing increased over the course of the year while perceived stress decreased. Lessons Learned: Medical school programs may benefit from allowing students to direct or contribute to the design of their own wellness curriculum. Additionally, medical education should work toward creating a more supportive learning environment with improved flexibility in order to better meet students’ individual needs without compromising their education. Despite having low utilization rates overall, mental health resources remain an important aspect of student support services as they are used by students under greater amounts of perceived stress than their peers.

In contrast to this widespread provider knowledge gap, gender-diverse patients bring critical knowledge from their own experiences to health care. Embracing varied epistemologies, or sources of knowledge, within medical education has the potential to enhance gender-affirming care by intentionally placing value on the lived experiences and emphasizing the credibility of gender-diverse patients. Evidence: In this article, the authors endorse a model of epistemic peerhood in which the embodied knowledge of gender-diverse patients and the authoritative knowledge of providers are each valued for their contribution to care. The authors reflect on experiences developing gender-affirming healthcare curricula and how medical education has not yet adequately addressed gender-diverse care without embracing community knowledge. Implications: The authors identify three vital areas to integrate epistemic peerhood in medical training to address gaps in gender-affirming care: (1) collaborative student training methods that reflect embodied knowledge in the absence of, or in addition to, clinical expertise on gender-affirming care; (2) sustainable partnerships between academic programs and gender-diverse communities that foster continuous engagement from collaborators with lived experience; and (3) broad community input about best practices for representing gender diversity in patient simulation. Embracing epistemic peerhood in each of these areas would result in broader gender-diverse community representation and leadership in medical education, which would ultimately strengthen gender-affirming healthcare training. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141160202"

While efforts vary across institutions, much remains unanswered in the literature about best practices. Additionally, for the foreseeable future, challenges in the learning environment will likely continue and potentially worsen, given the confluence of multiple external stressors including the COVID-19 pandemic, faculty burnout and general political divisiveness in the nation. It is essential, therefore, to focus on indicators of improvement via process metrics such as knowledge and awareness of mistreatment policies and procedures, willingness to report, reasons for not reporting, and satisfaction with having made a report, while simultaneously focusing on the more complex challenge of eliminating mistreatment occurrences. Intervention: We describe the aspects of our mistreatment prevention and response system first implemented in 2017 along with process and outcome measures. The interventions included expanding our policy outlining appropriate conduct in the teacher-learner relationship; a graduated response protocol to allegations of mistreatment with a clear escalation approach; an online reporting system; a graduate medical education exit survey which mirrors the AAMC Graduation Questionnaire on mistreatment; a robust communication and professional development campaign; a comprehensive data dashboard; and a comprehensive summary report dissemination plan. Context: The interventions were implemented at the largest allopathic medical school in the U.S., with nine campuses across the state. The system is available to all learners, including medical students, graduate students, residents, and fellows. Impact: Both institutional and national data sources have informed the continuous improvement strategies. Data from internal reporting systems, institutional surveys, and national data are presented from 2017 to 2021. Findings include an increasing number of incidents reported each year, including confidential reports from students who include their contact information rather than report anonymously, which we view as an indicator of learner trust in the system. Our data also show consistent improvements in learners’ awareness of the policy and procedures and satisfaction with having made a report. We also include other data such as the nature of complaints submitted and timeliness of our institutional response. Lessons Learned: We present several lessons learned that may guide other institutions looking to similarly improve their mistreatment systems, such as a close partnership between faculty affairs, diversity affairs, and educational affairs leadership; communication, professional development, and training through multiple venues and with all stakeholders; easily accessible reporting with anonymous and confidential options and the ability to report on behalf of others; policy development guidance; data transparency and dissemination; and trust-building activities and ongoing feedback from learners. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138170972"

Development of a strong professional identity as an educator leads to greater career satisfaction and a higher likelihood of staying in academic medicine. However, little is known about how this identity develops, especially in the training environment where there are competing pressures to develop as a clinician and researcher. This study aimed to explore professional identity formation in residents and fellows interested in becoming educators. Approach: We used a longitudinal, qualitative approach to investigate professional identity formation in residents and fellows participating in the Clinician-Educator Training Pathway. The longitudinal nature allowed us to temporally explore which aspects of the program and experiences acted as barriers or facilitators of professional identity formation as a CE. Our study used the social cognitive career theory (SCCT) Career Choice Model, which considers contextual influences in addition to the three variables of self-efficacy beliefs, outcome expectations, and goals. Findings: We found that participants shared a common goal of building self-efficacy as an educator. Participants took actions to engage more deliberately in formal and informal teaching and acting as an educator by giving learner feedback, developing curricula, and consuming and conducting educational research, all of which increased self-efficacy as educators. At the beginning of the program, participants were unclear of the roles and trajectories followed to become CEs. Engaging with a community of CEs clarified pathways and presented role models that could be seen as possible selves. This study also elucidated contextual influences relating to personal factors, career opportunities, and potential for advancement that mediated the goals and actions taken by participants to become educators. Insights: This study demonstrates that the SCCT Career Choice Model provides an excellent framework for understanding professional identity formation in future educators. Our participants built self-efficacy, formed outcome expectations, and set goals and took specific actions toward the goal of becoming an educator. Participants tested the various role model attributes as possible selves to see how those would be effective in their own career. Reflection on expectations, career goals, and self-efficacy as a clinician and an educator can assist in identity formation as a CE and can assist those designing CE training programs to better support identity formation in their participants. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112775382"

Literature supports the positive influences of empathy on doctor-patient relationship, patient satisfaction, and positive clinical outcomes. Background: Many studies have dealt with the development of empathy measurement tools for physicians and medical students. A frequently used empathy measuring instrument for medical students is the “Interpersonal Reactivity Index” (IRI) which was designed to measure the multi-dimensional aspects of empathy in the general adult population. Most previous literature which validated IRI for medical students has used factor analysis, whilst studies applying Rasch models have been limited. Our study aimed to investigate the psychometric properties of a modified version of IRI for medical students using Rasch analysis. Approach: Medical students (1,293) from 15 medical schools in South Korea participated in an online questionnaire consisting of 28 items of the Korean translated version of IRI. We applied exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using polychoric correlation matrix to determine the optimal number of factors followed by Rasch analysis and McDonald’s Omega calculation. Findings: The adapted IRI-MS (IRI for medical students) consisted of 17 items in four dimensions: empathic concern (5), fictitious situation (4), perspective taking (4), and personal distress (4). The overall fit of IRI-MS revealed an acceptable goodness-of-fit for all 17 items and a positive point measure correlation for all items. Reliability indices from the Rasch modeling and McDonald’s Omega values of all four dimensions were satisfactory for research. We found the Wright-Andrich maps and category probability curves of the IRI’s four dimensions to be less than optimal in measuring empathy levels with adequate precision. Conclusions: Rasch analysis of IRI-MS fell short from being able to prove satisfactory validity in measuring the multidimensional nature of empathy in medical students. However, our study applying Rasch analysis may serve as groundwork for future studies, to further develop from the shortcomings of our findings.

In New York State, where Black and Latino patients are more than twice as likely to have Medicaid as white patients, this practice leads to de facto racial segregation in healthcare. Emerging evidence suggests that this segregation of care is detrimental to both patient care and medical education. Medical students are uniquely positioned to be change makers in this space but face significant barriers to speaking out about these disparities and successfully advocating for institutional change. Approach: The authors designed, piloted, and distributed a 16-item survey on segregated care to third-year medical students at a large academic medical center in New York City. Students were asked both open- and close-ended questions about witnessing separation and differences in patient care on the basis of insurance during their clinical rotations. The survey was shared with 140 students in March 2019 with a response rate of 46.4% (n = 65). Preliminary findings were presented to school and hospital administrators. Findings: More than half of survey respondents reported witnessing separation of patient care or differences in patient care on the basis of insurance (56.3%, n = 36 and 51.6%, n = 33 respectively). Many students reported that these experiences contributed to cynicism and burnout. The authors leveraged these results to advocate for quality improvement measures. In Ob-Gyn, department leadership launched a clinical transformation taskforce and recruited a new Vice Chair of Clinical Transformation/Chief Patient Experience Officer, whose role includes addressing segregated care and disparities in health outcomes. The hospital committed to establishing integrated practices in new clinical spaces and launching a similar survey among house staff. Insights: Many medical students experience and participate in segregated care during their clerkships and this has the potential to impact their education. Medical students are well-positioned to recognize segregated care across health systems and leverage their experiences for advocacy. A survey-based approach can be a powerful tool enabling students to collect these experiences to address segregated care and other health equity issues. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133257018"

Student behavior in feedback processes may impact feedback outcomes. Student feedback behavior includes recognizing, seeking, evaluating, and utilizing feedback. Student feedback behavior is influenced by numerous student attributes and environmental factors. ApproachWe aimed to explore influences on medical student feedback behavior during clinical attachments. We adopted a subjective inductive qualitative approach. We conducted 7 focus groups with 46 medical students undertaking pediatric hospital-based attachments. We based our discussion framework on existing characterizations of student feedback behavior and the educational alliance model with its focus on the relationship between learners and teachers, and the active role played by both. During initial data analysis, we identified that our results exhibited aspects of Bandura’s model of Triadic Reciprocal Causation within Social Cognitive Theory. In line with our subjective inductive approach, we adopted Triadic Reciprocal Causation at this point for further analysis and interpretation. This allowed us to conceptualize the emerging interactions between influences on feedback behavior. Findings We identified three key determinants of student feedback behavior: Environmental influences, Student attributes and Relationships between teachers and students. Environmental influences encompassed factors external to the student, including Teacher attributes and behaviors and The clinical learning context. Through the lens of Triadic Reciprocal Causation, the interrelationships between the determinants of feedback behavior gave rise to five key themes: Interactions between student feedback behavior and environmental influences of the clinical learning context, Interactions between student feedback behavior and environmental influences of teacher attributes and behaviors, Interactions between student attributes and student feedback behavior, Interactions between student attributes and environmental influences of teacher attributes and behaviors, and Relationships and the determinants of student feedback behavior.Insights: We apply the Triadic Reciprocal Causation model of Social Cognitive Theory to understand the influences on student feedback behavior and the interactions between them. We extend the model by situating relationships between students and teachers as a central factor. Future interventions to facilitate students’ role in feedback will need to address student attributes, environmental factors, and student-teacher relationships, appreciating the codependent nature of these influences. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132803181"

Such capacity to convey valuable advice, however, may depend on the similitude of experiences. Given that many factors can disrupt homogeneity, including curriculum renewal, we must better understand whether junior trainees feel disadvantaged when they do not have more senior peers with similar experiences. This study was, therefore, conducted to examine the focus of, and engagement with, advice available through NPIs during curriculum renewal. Approach: We used a generic exploratory qualitative research approach. Twenty MD undergraduate students, seven from the Class of 2019 (the first cohort post-curriculum change), and thirteen from the Class of 2020 (the first cohort with access to more senior students in the new curriculum), participated in semi-structured interviews. Anonymized transcriptions were analyzed with open, axial, and selective coding to generate themes until saturation was attained. Findings: Participants from the Class of 2019 reported having particularly few reasons to seek advice; because curriculum renewal disrupted their near peers’ capacity to provide critical insights, students exerted little effort to learn from them. That said, this vacuum was not generally cause for concern. Deeper probing illustrated why: advice given during NPIs in both classes more commonly focused on nonacademic (e.g., work-life balance issues) than academic advice; academic advice, when sought or offered, tended not to be aimed at improving understanding of curriculum dependent content; and, while students in both classes welcomed advice, both were wary of accepting it at face value, precluding a sense of dependence on senior peers. Insights: Students’ skepticism about the overall utility of academic advice raises a number of important issues for medical education and training. Positively, it shielded students from feeling loss when advice from similarly trained students was not available, reducing concerns about disadvantage that could arise during periods of curriculum revision. On the other hand, knowing that what students perceive and what educators claim to be important aspects of training can be at odds and knowing that self-assessment is flawed makes it surprising and unsettling, respectively, that participants so readily treated the lessons learned by those who came before them as irrelevant. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115123017"

One method of developing teaching skills is participation in peer teaching with observation and feedback from peers. This study aims to explore student teachers’ experiences of peer observation of teaching and how they intend to utilize this feedback. Approach: We conducted individual semi-structured interviews with peer tutors who had experienced peer observation of their small group teaching and subsequent feedback. The interviews were conducted by a medical student peer not involved in the peer observation of teaching scheme. They were audio recorded and transcribed. The pseudonymised transcripts were coded independently by two researchers using thematic analysis. Findings: Nine students participated in interviews lasting a mean of 42 minutes. We identified three main themes: motivations for observation, experiences of observation, and responses to feedback. Students were motivated to have their teaching observed by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors: to develop their skills and competence as a teacher, in recognition of the important role this plays in their career, to provide reassurance that they are providing good quality teaching, to ensure the content of their teaching is appropriate and accurate, and to provide evidence of engagement in, and development of, teaching. Students described feeling nervous before the observations and preparing more for their teaching than they might normally, however, during the observations they felt more comfortable which they attributed to the peer-peer relationship. Students described finding the narrative feedback more useful than the quantitative elements as it provided more detail as to how they might improve. Several students described how they have used the feedback they have received on their teaching to improve subsequent sessions. Insights: Peer observation of teaching is a useful and acceptable method of providing feedback on student teaching and recipients intend to use this feedback to improve their teaching. © 2021 The Author(s).

Without guidance, lengthy deliberations by decision makers and competence committees can end inconclusively with unresolved concerns. These decisional dilemmas are heightened by their potential impacts. For learners, erroneous decisions may lead to an unjustified exit from a long-desired career, or premature promotion to clinical responsibilities. For educators, there is the risk of wrongful decision-making, leading to successful appeals and mistrust. For communities, ill-prepared graduates risk the quality and safety of care. Approaches such as psychometric analyses are limited when decision-makers are faced with seemingly contradictory qualitative and quantitative evidence about the same individual. Expertise in using such evidence to make fair and defensible decisions is well established in judicial practice but is yet to be practically applied to assessment decision-making. Approach: Through interdisciplinary exchange, we investigated medical education and judicial perspectives on decision-making to explore whether principles of decision-making in law could be applied to educational assessment decision-making. Using Dialogic Inquiry, an iterative process of scholarly and mutual critique, we contrasted assessment decision making in medical education with judicial practice to identify key principles in judicial decision-making relevant to educational assessment decisions. We developed vignettes about common but problematic high-stakes decision-making scenarios to test how these principles could apply. Findings: Over 14 sessions, we identified, described, and applied four principles for fair, reasonable, and transparent assessment decision-making. These were: The person whose interests are affected has a right to know the case against them, and to be heard. Reasons for the decision should be given. Rules should be transparent and consistently applied. Like cases should be treated alike and unlike cases treated differently. Reflecting our dialogic process, we report findings by separately presenting the medical educator and judicial perspectives, followed by a synthesis describing a preferred approach to decision-making in three vignettes. Insights: Judicial principles remind educators to consider both sides of arguments, to be consistent, and to demonstrate transparency when making assessment decisions. Dialogic Inquiry is a useful approach for generating interdisciplinary insights on challenges in medical education by critiquing difference (e.g., the meaning of objectivity) and achieving synthesis where possible (e.g., fairness is not equal treatment of all cases). Our principles and exemplars provide groundwork for promoting good practice and furthering assessment research toward fairer and more robust decisions that will assist learning. © 2022 The Author(s).

This trend may reduce access to medical school at a time of historic recognition of the need for greater openness and diversity in medical education by disadvantaging candidates who are underrepresented in medicine. The effects of high education-related debt for medical school needs greater consideration. Evidence: The implementation staircase model is employed as lens for understanding the impact of debt on trainees who are underrepresented in medicine and the healthcare system overall. Higher debt burdens are associated with worse mental health outcomes and increased odds of attrition in medical school. Trainees cite debt as a concern in considering primary care careers. Those with greater debt are less likely to pursue or remain in academic careers. Implications: The current financial aid system’s reliance on high debt burden undermines goals to improve the representation of underrepresented candidates in primary care and academic medicine. Alternative models requiring less debt could facilitate the creation of a more diverse workforce in healthcare. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117526582"

We explored perceptions of programmatic support, parental leave, breastfeeding, and self-reported biggest challenges among a large cohort of physician mothers in a variety of medical specialties and across the stage of training when they had their first child. Our goal was to inform strategies to help improve the physician parent experience. Approach: This cross-sectional, observational survey study was performed using a convenience sample from an online physician-mom support group from January to February 2018. Descriptive statistics and bivariate analyses were used to report results and examine relationships between career stage at first child and outcome variables. Responses to the open-ended question, “What is your biggest challenge as a physician mom?” were qualitatively analyzed. Findings: The survey received 896 complete responses. The most common specialties were obstetrics and gynecology (25.3%), pediatrics (19.9%), internal medicine or medicine/pediatrics (17.1%), and family medicine (10.2%). The majority of participants (63.9%) had their first child during medical training, including medical school (14.3%), residency (35.8%) or fellowship (13.6%). Medical students were less likely to perceive programmatic support than residents or fellows (44.1% vs. 63.1% vs. 62.3%, respectively), and only 19.9% of participants who became parents during medical training reported having a clear and adequate parental leave policy. Nearly 70% of participants breastfed for six months or more, with no statistical differences across career stage. Most participants (57.6%) delayed child-bearing for one or more reasons, with 32.3% delaying to complete training. The most common codes applied to responses for ‘biggest challenges as a physician mom’ were insufficient time, lack of work-life balance, missing out, and over-expectation. Insights: Physician mothers, particularly those who had their first child during training, continue to struggle with support from training programs, finding work-life balance, and feelings of inadequacy. Interventions such as clear and adequate leave policies, program-sponsored or onsite childcare and improved programmatic support of breastfeeding and pumping may help to ameliorate the challenges described by our participants. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142176754"

Unclear expectations, disconnect between the pre-clinical and clinical environments, and feelings of exclusion from the team all negatively influence clerkship experiences. These difficulties are magnified on interventional-based clerkships due to the central role of therapeutic reasoning. Therapeutic reasoning is the process by which clinicians review and select treatments for their patients. Surgical therapeutic reasoning is challenging and infrequently addressed explicitly in the pre-clinical curriculum. This contributes to confusion among medical students as they transition from pre-clinical to clinical learning. Evidence: Multiple studies have identified challenges to medical students’ transition to clinical clerkships. Prior authors have outlined numerous barriers to successful medical student integration to clinical teams, including surgical teams. Studies that have assessed students’ perceptions of their transition to a clinical setting noted poor understanding of treatment decisions as a source of anxiety. Additionally, of particular importance to medical student team learning is their assimilation into the “communities of clinical practice,” groups of healthcare professionals who form teams with which students rotate. Surgeons have distinct approaches to the clinical process compared with non-interventionalists, particularly related to post-diagnostic involvement in care and performing diagnostic workup and treatment concurrently. Knowledge of these approaches is important for integration into surgical teams. Implications: An understanding of interventional therapeutic reasoning is critical to allow for medical students’ team integration on surgical and interventional clerkships. By incorporating education involving these concepts during the orientation period prior to students’ transition to surgical clerkships, we can help students modify traditional mental frameworks to effectively evaluate, present, and select appropriate interventions for patients. Such education should include a didactic introduction to therapeutic reasoning, interactive discussion with surgeons, and exercises for students to practice skills. This will maximize learning opportunities and clerkship experience. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122850207"

Although CR-SAQs carry benefits for medical students and educators, the faculty perception that the amount of time required to create and score CR-SAQs is not feasible and concerns about reliable scoring may impede the use of this assessment type in medical education. Intervention: Three US medical schools collaborated to write and score CR-SAQs based on a single vignette. Study participants included faculty question writers (N = 5) and three groups of scorers: faculty content experts (N = 7), faculty non-content experts (N = 6), and fourth-year medical students (N = 7). Structured interviews were performed with question writers and an online survey was administered to scorers to gather information about their process for creating and scoring CR-SAQs. A content analysis was performed on the qualitative data using Bowen&amp;#x2019;s model of feasibility as a framework. To examine inter-rater reliability between the content expert and other scorers, a random selection of fifty student responses from each site were scored by each site&amp;#x2019;s faculty content experts, faculty non-content experts, and student scorers. A holistic rubric (6-point Likert scale) was used by two schools and an analytic rubric (3-4 point checklist) was used by one school. Cohen&amp;#x2019;s weighted kappa (&amp;#x3ba;w) was used to evaluate inter-rater reliability. Context: This research study was implemented at three US medical schools that are nationally dispersed and have been administering CR-SAQ summative exams as part of their programs of assessment for at least five years. The study exam question was included in an end-of-course summative exam during the first year of medical school. Impact: Five question writers (100%) participated in the interviews and twelve scorers (60% response rate) completed the survey. Qualitative comments revealed three aspects of feasibility: practicality (time, institutional culture, teamwork), implementation (steps in the question writing and scoring process), and adaptation (feedback, rubric adjustment, continuous quality improvement). The scorers&amp;#x2019; described their experience in terms of the need for outside resources, concern about lack of expertise, and value gained through scoring. Inter-rater reliability between the faculty content expert and student scorers was fair/moderate (&amp;#x3ba;w=.34-.53, holistic rubrics) or substantial (&amp;#x3ba;w=.67-.76, analytic rubric), but much lower between faculty content and non-content experts (&amp;#x3ba;w=.18-.29, holistic rubrics; &amp;#x3ba;w=.59-.66, analytic rubric). Lessons Learned: Our findings show that from the faculty perspective it is feasible to include CR-SAQs in summative exams and we provide practical information for medical educators creating and scoring CR-SAQs. We also learned that CR-SAQs can be reliably scored by faculty without content expertise or senior medical students using an analytic rubric, or by senior medical students using a holistic rubric, which provides options to alleviate the faculty burden associated with grading CR-SAQs. © 2022 Taylor &amp;#x0026; Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136495137"

COVID-19 offers a rare opportunity to better understand how individuals respond to and make meaning within the shared context of an extraordinary event. We aimed to examine if and how residents and fellows engaged in transformative learning when caring for COVID-19 positive patients during the initial peak of the pandemic (Spring 2020). Approach: We conducted an interpretive qualitative study to identify themes pertaining to transformative learning. We used semi-structured interviews of residents and fellows who were directly or indirectly involved in the care of COVID-19 positive patients admitted to the inpatient wards or the intensive care units during the first peak of the pandemic (defined as March 11th–May 28th, 2020) at our Mid-Atlantic academic health system. We used the medium of comics to depict select interviewees’ experiences during the pandemic as a novel way to represent themes from the interviews. Findings: Three main themes arose from our qualitative analysis. These included “a sense of guilt,” “the impact on training,” and “venues and processes for reflection.” In comparing their experiences with colleagues and friends at other institutions with higher COVID-19 case volume, trainees reflected on how they felt lucky, and this led to guilt, although not necessarily transformation. The impact of COVID-19 on the training environment had transformative potential. Trainees challenged their previously held assumptions on the necessity of various surgeries, in-person visits, and physical examination maneuvers when COVID-19 posed a barrier. Finally, while trainees recalled multiple situations throughout the pandemic when they believed they were engaging in reflection, such reflection did not appear to reach so deep as to alter participants’ underlying assumptions until the research interview itself, suggesting that transformation was incomplete. Insights: Our purposive sample of residents and fellows who cared for COVID-19 positive patients during the initial peak of the pandemic made meaning of their experience in multiple ways. The largest shift in worldview due to the pandemic appeared to be related to the instrumental utility of certain common medical practices or procedures. This, in turn, was the most prominent influence on how these trainees felt they would practice in the future, and translated to a shift in how they appraised evidence. However, lack of opportunity for reflection may have adversely impacted the ability for transformation to take place. Given that multiple trainees showed appreciation for the critical reflection venue that was the research interview, academic leadership should ensure similar venues exist during training, even after the pandemic ends. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130442064"

Past research has investigated performance and cognitions associated with college students’ in-class media multitasking behavior, but the extent and correlates among medical students is relatively unknown. Approach: We surveyed medical students at our institution to quantify media multitasking behaviors and related beliefs, and we collected corresponding course grades. Our research applies the Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction theory to analyze course and cognitive factors influencing media multitasking behavior in medical students. Correlation of media multitasking behavior with average and block grades assessed potential academic impact of the behavior. Findings: Media multitasking was common among medical students. Reported extent of media multitasking among medical students (N = 119) was not related to course grades but was driven by an interplay of beliefs about the behavior and specific course factors. Based on our hierarchical regression model, concerns about boredom appear to be the major cognitive belief underlying behavior. Insights: Our findings, in the context of the Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction theory, show influential factors that impact medical students’ behavior regarding media multitasking. A campaign targeting these factors influencing behavior may be the most effective approach to limit students’ media multitasking and its potential impact on performance. Though our research did not find an association between the extent of media multitasking and course grades, our study was limited by self-report of media multitasking and relatively crude measures of academic performance. Further research is required to measure these behaviors and potential outcomes.

In many medical schools this has prompted additions to curricula that allow students to explore the gray—as opposed to the black and white—areas of medicine through arts, humanities, and social sciences. As curricula have expanded and diversified in this way, both medical educators and students have begun to ask: what is the best way to teach medical humanities? Evidence: In this article, five current medical students reflect on their experiences of medical humanities teaching through intercalated BSc programmes in the UK. What follows is a broad exploration of how the incorporation of medical humanities into students’ time at university can improve clinical practice where the more rigid, objective-driven, model of medicine falls short. Implications: This article reinforces the merit of moving beyond a purely biomedical model of medical education. Using the student voice as a vector for critique and discussion, we provide a starting point for uncovering the path toward true integration of humanities-style teaching into medical school curricula. © 2022 The Author(s).

But although health professional courses grow in number and continue to graduate entry-level practitioners annually, there are signs that health professional education is not quite hitting the “purpose” mark. Preparedness is a term encountered often in health professional education, but it is besieged with challenges. Those challenges relate to whether graduates are prepared for their future careers and how preparedness for practice is understood; understandings of preparedness influence what curriculum, teaching, and learning prepares graduates about and for. Evidence: There is a wealth of the literature that suggests that graduates are not prepared for practice or believe they are not. This literature tends to grow rather than diminish, with arguments about preparedness materializing time and again. Preparedness means different things to students, academics, and practitioners and this creates misunderstanding as well as lessening the construct’s value to research, education, and practice. What it means to be prepared is in fact not a static construct but changes in response to the needs of individuals and communities and broader societal context. When preparedness is defined as competence in skills or knowledge, graduates will be ill equipped to operate in the chaotic, ambiguous times we now face as competencies tend to oversimplify and reduce the demands of practice. Implications: Preparedness is only one purpose that could be attached to the educational formation of university graduates. It is time we expand our thinking about what is valuable and necessary to learn in order to become health professionals equipped to address the health and social care problems now and to come. Furthermore, continuing to address the challenges of preparedness for practice in the same ways as we have done for decades will not result in change; new and different educational approaches are required to meaningfully reimagine health professional education. We need to value education as a scholarly field in its own right, as much as we do evidence-based healthcare. A concept that prompts us to think and act in these reinvigorated ways is stewardship, which I offer as an expansive way to think about the purposes and desired outcomes of health professional education. Stewardship is an idea that sustains and cares for the professions, and therefore is highly relevant to the preparation of healthcare practitioners. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144239197"

Dynamic interactions among faculty and between faculty and their socio-cultural working environments contribute to the mystique of academic advancement. There are few empirical studies that analyze the social practice of faculty career advancement in academic medicine, especially those that focus on relations between individual and environmental contexts. This study aimed to investigate various faculty members’ experiences around career advancement in a medical school. Through the analytical lens of Bourdieu’s theory of practice, we focused on the relationship among individuals, positions, and environmental contexts. Approach: Following a general process of interpretive grounded theory, we collected faculty members’ perceptions and experiences related to their career development and advancement via in-depth semi structured-interviews of 23 faculty at a medical school in the United States. We analyzed the interview transcripts using thematic and constant-comparison analyses, informed by Bourdieu’s theory of practice emphasizing the concepts of habitus, field, doxa, illusio, and capital. Findings: While there was a general perception of collaborative success in the school, access to resources seemed to be unequally distributed and linked to faculty positions. Career opportunities, such as leadership and promotion, were mostly granted by leaders based on interpersonal relationships (social capital). Clinical faculty’s limited access to professional development activities (cultural capital), including research, limited their likelihood for promotion (symbolic capital) at the school. An institutional emphasis on clinical productivity reinforced clinical faculty’s constraints on academic scholarship, which led to perceived inequities by clinical faculty. Participants also perceived subtle gender bias and an unequal distribution of power among the specialties, which contradicted a culture of collaboration and support in the school. Insights: Complex power structures influence faculty career success. Unequal access and differential power among faculty positions resulted in disparities in career advancement. Greater transparency, equity, and inclusivity are obvious suggestions for change to allow all faculty to benefit from essential resources and career building opportunities. Furthermore, building high-quality relationships between leaders and faculty and mutual respect between specialties are essential to sustaining an organizational culture conducive to career success for all faculty. Faculty will benefit from a greater awareness of the structural and normative aspects of a medical school that are less obvious and more difficult to change. This is the value of applying Bourdieu’s theory of practice to the socio-cultural dynamics of the medical school. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137771577"

Within each, I explicate the following tensions: (1) communication as an individual skill vs. communication as a distributed dynamic; (2) communication as a process of information exchange vs. communication as mutual accountability; (3) communication for institutional outcomes vs. communication for multiple purposes. Approach: I use discourse-analytic approaches to reflexively analyze communication-skills training practices. My data are from a communication-skills practice exam for third-year medical students with simulated patients. The purpose of my analysis is to illustrate the metadiscursive tensions as they occur via (1) question-and-answer sequences; (2) repairs; and (3) orientations to institutional protocols. Findings: Through my analysis, I analyze the affordances and constraints of metadiscursive tensions. (1) Communication as an individual skill affords concrete and systematic frameworks for teaching and assessment, while communication as a distributed dynamic emphasizes the joint nature of talk and patient-centeredness. Additionally, simulation is a distinct genre of communication, specifically in how simulated patients communicate differently than actual patients, which can limit their utility for individual assessment. (2) Communication skills and communication-skills teaching embody the paradigm of cause and effect, which is in tension with communication as a process of mutual accountability. Conceptualizing communication skills and communication-skills learning as interventions in the possession of knowledge/skills affords claims of effectiveness but at the risk of essentializing students and patients as data points. (3) The institutional purposes of communication-skills training are often associated with positive outcomes for patients and providers but such findings often oversimplify the multifunctionality of talk, namely who we show ourselves to be through communication. Insights: To draw on the affordances of metadiscursive practices, I suggest incorporating video-based reflexive dialogues as addendums to simulation-based learning sessions. In video-based reflexive dialogues, medical students and simulated patients watch their simulated consultations together and discuss mutual goals, what communication strategies worked toward those goals, and what else talk accomplished. Retooling communication-skills teaching and learning to promote reflexivity as a “meta-skill” provides learners and practitioners the resources to reflect on and act in unison with patients toward mutual goals of health and well-being. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123957472"

Accrediting bodies now mandate that training programs teach in ways that promote self-directed learning (SDL) but do not provide adequate guidance on how to address this requirement. Evidence: The model for the SDL mandate in physician training is based mostly on early childhood and secondary education evidence and literature, and may not capture the unique environment of medical training and clinical education. Furthermore, there is uncertainty about how medical schools and postgraduate training programs should implement and evaluate SDL educational interventions. The Shapiro Institute for Education and Research, in conjunction with the Association of American Medical Colleges, convened teams from eight medical schools from North America to address the challenge of defining, implementing, and evaluating SDL and the structures needed to nurture and support its development in health professional training. Implications: In this commentary, the authors describe SDL in Medical Education, (SDL-ME), which is a construct of learning and pedagogy specific to medical students and physicians in training. SDL-ME builds on the foundations of SDL and self-regulated learning theory, but is specifically contextualized for the unique responsibilities of physicians to patients, inter-professional teams, and society. Through consensus, the authors offer suggestions for training programs to teach and evaluate SDL-ME. To teach self-directed learning requires placing the construct in the context of patient care and of an obligation to society at large. The SDL-ME construct builds upon SDL and SRL frameworks and suggests SDL as foundational to health professional identity formation.

To date, the effectiveness of these efforts is unclear. In addition, evidence increasingly suggests that the major drivers of distress appear to be factors within the social, learning, and work environments. Specific to medical schools in the United States, neither the Liaison Committee on Medical Education nor the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation include accreditation standards regarding well-being curricula and, as such, these curricula are not well-integrated into students’ medical school experience. Current accreditation standards also do not specifically require institutions to assess or address systemic factors of the learning environment that negatively affect student well-being. Evidence: This paper proposes expanding current Liaison Committee on Medical Education and Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation standards on professionalism to incorporate well-being as a core component of professional identity formation by requiring individual and institutional-level actions. Proposed changes to accreditation standards include (1) institutional assessment of the impact of the learning environment on student well-being; (2) continuous quality improvement efforts to address structural factors associated with student well-being and modification of practices that impair student well-being; and (3) integrated curriculum with related assessment to educate students on empirically-supported strategies for well-being. Implications: Refining undergraduate medical education accreditation standards in the United States to include language specific to student well-being will facilitate long overdue changes to the learning environment. In the end, the goal is not just to improve medical student well-being, but to provide a workforce better equipped for a sustainable and meaningful career. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124094245"

Potential consequences of this educational dearth include persistent inaccessibility of health care facilities and delivery of inequitable health care to individuals with disabilities. Evidence: Several working groups have proposed disability-specific competencies for health professions education and means by which to integrate them into existing curricula. A limited number of medical schools and residency programs have formally introduced disability-specific materials into their curricula. To our knowledge, however, there are no generalist (internal medicine or family medicine) residency programs that offer specialized training in the clinical care of people with disabilities. Implications: Offering generalist physicians the opportunity to acquire the clinical and cognitive skills required to provide thorough and equitable health care to people with disabilities is critically important. There are too few physiatrists to see to their care needs. In this manuscript, we present a novel concentration in an Internal Medicine residency program in the care of individuals with a variety of disabilities. Our hope is that this work will initiate discussions among educational leaders about how to address the lack of graduate medical education-level training in disability care. We also hope it will afford program directors the opportunity to implement similar concentrations and tracks and will eventually produce a generation of generalists who are well-equipped to help care for people with disabilities. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138224877"

Many studies frame this challenge as a problem of basic science knowledge transfer predominantly influenced by students’ individual cognitive processes. Social cognitive theory would support extending this framing to the interplay between the individual’s cognition, the environment, and their behaviors. This study investigates senior medical students’ experiences of biochemistry knowledge use during workplace learning and examines how their experiences were influenced by interactions with people and other elements of the clinical learning environment. Approach: The authors used a qualitative approach with a constructivist orientation. From September to November 2020 they conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 fourth-year medical students at one institution who had completed the pre-clerkship curriculum, core clinical clerkships, and the United States Medical Licensing Exam Step 1. The authors identified themes using thematic analysis. Findings: Participants reported that they infrequently used or connected to biochemistry knowledge in workplace patient care activities, yet all had examples of such connections that they found valuable to learning. Most participants felt the responsibility for making connections between biochemistry knowledge and activities in the clinical workplace should be shared between themselves and supervisors, but connections were often recognized and acted on only by the student. Connections that participants described prompted their effort to retrieve knowledge or fill a perceived learning gap. Participants identified multiple barriers and facilitators to connecting, including supervisors’ behaviors and perceived knowledge, and “patients seen” in clerkships. Participants also reported learning biochemistry during USMLE Step 1 study that did not connect to patient care activities, underscoring a perception of disconnect. Insights: This study identifies specific personal, social, and physical environmental elements that influence students’ perceived use of biochemistry during patient care activities. Though these findings may be most significant for biochemistry, they likely extend to other basic science disciplines. Students’ self-directed efforts to connect to their biochemistry knowledge could be augmented by increased social support from clinical supervisors, which in turn likely requires faculty development. Opportunities for connection could be enhanced by embedding into the environment instructional strategies or technologies that build on known authentic connections between biochemistry and “patients seen” in clerkships. These efforts could strengthen student learning, improve clinical supervisors’ self-efficacy, and better inform curriculum design. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133625284"

In parallel, there have been growing student numbers in other healthcare professions and new professions whose roles overlap with doctors, such as advanced nurse practitioners and physician associates, have been introduced. These increasing numbers of medical students and other healthcare professions training in the same clinical setting have led to questions about the effect on the student experience. We aimed to investigate the impact of student-student encounters on the learning experience during clinical placements before student numbers increase further. Approach: In this investigation medical student perceptions were collected retrospectively at Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia in the UK, during the 2018/19 academic year following two clinical placements in secondary care settings. Through mandatory online course evaluations, all medical students were asked if their learning had been positively or negatively affected by other students, and how frequently they had certain student-student experiences. Findings: Responses from 786 (of 844) medical students (93% response rate) demonstrated that most students felt their learning had been affected in some way by the presence of others while on their secondary care placements. Students experienced both positive and negative impacts of encounters with other students. Final year students tended to report more negative experiences, with first year students reporting more positive. while some students had experienced competition for learning opportunities and lower quality interactions with patients and doctors due to “overcrowding,” more students reported benefits from learning from and with other students. However, it also was found that any negative encounters with other students, even if accompanied by positive experiences, detrimentally affected student satisfaction with the placement. Insights: This investigation indicates that student-student interactions influence the clinical learning experience of medical students both positively and negatively. Given the overriding influence of negative encounters, the findings suggest a need to maximize the beneficial effects of encountering other students on clinical placements; while protecting against missed or poor-quality learning opportunities due to competition between students, particularly for more senior students. Medical educators need to consider where their clinical attachments are at risk from multiple students being present at the same time and work to alleviate the negative impacts of such student-student encounters, while actively encouraging peer learning experiences between the medical students and collaborative activities between students of different healthcare professions. This is likely to become increasingly important as student numbers in medicine and other healthcare professions continue to grow. © 2021 The Author(s).

Near-peer tutors often alleviate faculty teaching burden, but little is known about what teaching methods near-peer and faculty tutors use. Using the lens of cognitive apprenticeship, this study describes how much time faculty and near-peer tutors spend on different teaching methods during abdominal ultrasound skills training. Approach: Sixteen near-peer and 16 faculty tutors were videotaped during one 55-min practical ultrasound lesson with randomly assigned students. Videos were directly coded using Cognitive Apprenticeship teaching methods and activities. Segment durations were summed up and compared quantitatively. Findings: All 32 tutors spent most of the time on observing and helping students (Coaching, Median 29:14 minutes), followed by asking open and stimulating questions (Articulation, 12:04 minutes and demonstrating and giving explanations (Modeling, 04:50 minutes). Overall, distributions of teaching methods used were similar between faculty and near-peer tutors. However, faculty tutors spent more time on helping students manually, whereas near-peer tutors spent more time on exploring students’ learning gaps and establishing a safe learning climate. Cognitive Apprenticeship was well suited as observational framework to describe ultrasound skills. Insights: Ultrasound train-the-tutor programs should particularly focus on coaching and articulation. Near-peers’ similar use of teaching methods adds to the evidence that supports the use of near-peer teaching in ultrasound skills education. © 2022 The Author(s).

Musculoskeletal medicine is often considered a specialized area of practice despite the high prevalence of musculoskeletal conditions in the general population and presenting to general clinical practices. Prior work has shown that medical learners and practicing clinicians have low confidence in these skills but understanding of the student perspective on why these skills are more difficult to acquire is unclear. Approach: Our study was guided by social constructivist learning theory to explore the learner experience and present their perspectives. Qualitative analysis investigated the difference between learning musculoskeletal physical examination versus other body systems, using the voices from 11 semi-structured focus group interviews. Participants included third-year medical students across two academic cohorts at one institution. Our analysis was grounded in the principles of phenomenology and used triangulation and reflexivity to provide rigorous analysis. Findings: Students provided rich and insightful perspectives regarding their experiences in learning musculoskeletal physical examination techniques. Four themes were developed from our data: a) the need for opportunities for both supervised and self-directed practice; b) assessment and competence as motivations for learning; c) the need for a different approach to the content and structure of musculoskeletal medicine and its associated examination techniques; and d) the need for distinct expertise and technical skill from musculoskeletal examination teachers. Insights: This study provides a valuable lens to critically reflect on existing curriculum and pedagogical approaches to musculoskeletal examination skills. Lessons from this study may be applicable to curriculum design in general, especially the teaching of physical examination skills, such as how it is taught and integrated with other content (including anatomy), how much practice is required, who teaches physical examination skills, and what faculty development is needed to standardize teaching. Promoting a learner-centered approach to the teaching and learning of these clinical skills will be beneficial to all stakeholders, especially to our future physicians and their patients.

Evidence: This exam, though controversial, propelled a movement emphasizing the value of clinical skills instruction and assessment in undergraduate medical education. While disappointed by the loss of this national driver that facilitated standardization of clinical skills education, the Directors of Clinical Skills Education (DOCS) see prospects for educational innovation and growth. DOCS is a national organization and inclusive community of clinical skills education leaders. This statement from DOCS regarding the discontinuation of USMLE Step 2 CS has been informed by DOCS meetings, listserv discussions, an internal survey, and a review of recent literature. Implications: Rigorous clinical skills assessment remains central to effective and patient-centered healthcare. DOCS shares specific concerns as well as potential solutions. Now free from the external pressure to prepare students for success on Step 2 CS, clinical skills educators can reprioritize content and restructure clinical skills programs to best meet the needs of learners and the ever-evolving healthcare landscape. DOCS, as an organization of clinical skills leaders, makes the following recommendations: 1) Collaboration amongst institutions must be prioritized; clinical skills assessment consortia should be expanded. 2) Governing, accrediting, and licensing organizations should leverage their influence to support and require high quality clinical skills assessments. 3) UME clinical skills leaders should develop ways to identify students who perform with exceptional, borderline, and poor clinical skills at their local institutions. 4) UME leadership should fully commit resources and curricular time to graduate students with excellent clinical skills. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127209402"

Yet, veterans remain significantly under-represented in entering classes; moreover, those veterans who do matriculate are not yet fully reflective of the diversity that the Armed Forces have to offer. Fortunately, specific measures have been shown to be effective at increasing both the number and diversity of student veterans in medical school. Evidence: In 2019, there were less than 60 military veterans who entered the 144 civilian medical schools in the United States, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. We identify common barriers faced by military veterans and propose best practices for medical schools to recruit and sustain them. We draw on the existing medical education literature about veteran support systems, and we underscore the unique challenges of veterans in medicine. Finally, we highlight innovative programs currently in place at several US medical schools that seek to address the needs of student veterans. This article provides a guide for how to recruit, assess, and nurture student veterans, suggesting a new way of thinking about this population of nontraditional medical students. Implications: This dearth of servicemembers significantly below what would be expected based on national demographic data is indicative of how medical schools offer few pathways to entry for military servicemembers—and far fewer for enlisted personnel and other populations traditionally under-represented in medicine. Should schools aim to recruit a veteran population that is truly representative of the military, additional measures need to be taken into consideration during the admissions review process. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111102056"

However, most (if not all) of these courses and programs were developed without significant input from experts in the fields of applied linguistics and second language acquisition (SLA). This resulted in programs and courses which differ in every conceivable way, most notably in course objectives, course content, and assessment measures. Despite multiple calls by applied linguists over the years, there has never been a systematic evaluation of medical Spanish programs through the lens of applied linguistics. The literature to date also demonstrates a near-complete absence of collaboration between medical school faculty, applied linguists, and language teachers, furthering the divide between what is now well-documented in the applied linguistics and SLA literature and the reported classroom practices in the medical Spanish context. Evidence: This article begins by contextualizing the development of medical Spanish courses under a backdrop of a critical need for multilingual medical professionals to better address documented healthcare disparities for Low English Proficiency (LEP) Spanish speakers, a steadily growing population in the United States. Then, the article introduces Task-Based Language Teaching (TBLT) as an opportunity for unprecedented collaboration between healthcare practitioners, medical Spanish course instructors, and applied linguists to improve medical Spanish curricular offerings. It goes on to identify specific opportunities for collaboration between medical Spanish professionals (instructors, course designers, program administrators) and applied linguists by highlighting three major areas for further development in the medical Spanish context. This collaboration would result in a pedagogical framework strongly rooted in applied linguistics research findings with direct, measurable impacts on both L2 Spanish learners in medical Spanish courses and the patients they will serve. Implications: Based on identified opportunities for curricular and programmatic improvement in published medical Spanish course reports, this article provides a rationale for TBLT as well as an overview of the process of TBLT course development. This detailed overview of TBLT course development with specific reference to the medical Spanish context presents an argument for the adoption of TBLT as an evidence-based and pedagogically viable alternative to current course offerings in medical Spanish programs. This article aims to identify a clear path forward to enable medical school program administrators and course and curriculum designers to take concrete steps to align courses with current best practices in second language pedagogy in order to optimize Spanish learning outcomes for their programs’ specific students. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123482852"

For medical educators, it has deleterious effects not only on the educator themselves, but also the students they are teaching. Though significant research has focused on factors associated with burnout, there is limited understanding of its counter: how physicians, particularly medical educators, derive joy from their work. Approach: This qualitative study included 15 highly-rated clinician educators in Internal Medicine who took part in individual semi-structured interviews. Participants were invited to discuss their sources of professional joy. After transcription, we used thematic content analysis: 50 themes were identified. Themes were then coded using the domains of the PERMA (Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishment) model of positive psychology, assigning each theme a best fit domain. Forty-five themes were mapped into the PERMA model. Findings: When describing professional joy, highly-rated clinician educators displayed high levels of overlap with all domains of the PERMA model. Interaction with the learner was a prominent source of professional joy, particularly within Positive Emotion, Engagement, and Relationship domains. Insights: Our findings indicate that the PERMA model appropriately defines the sources of professional joy for these educators.

To help address these challenges, some medical schools establish writing support programs, but those programs are often resource-intensive, involving didactic courses, accountability groups, formal mentorships, and even assistance from professional writers. Not all medical schools, however, provide resources for such programs, and many faculty members, especially clinicians, lack time needed to participate. Furthermore, success of these programs is typically judged by the total number of papers published. However, many clinicians would judge success as publication of the occasional papers they decide to write, not the total number of papers they or the group publish. With these issues in mind, we established a low-resource writing program focused on individual acceptance rates rather than total publications. Intervention: Our writing program is an informal group that meets monthly. Members bring their ideas for papers and drafts of papers, and other members provide critique and suggestions for improvement. Members then revise their papers to address that critique prior to journal submission. There are no formal or assigned mentors, courses, lectures, or writing assistants. Context: The program takes place in our family medicine department, in which faculty have various roles. Some group members are clinician-educators seeking to publish occasional clinical reviews or research articles; others are PhDs seeking to publish on aspects of their work. Impact: During the six years of the program, 86% of papers reviewed by the group were accepted for publication and 94% of those were accepted by the journal to which they were first submitted. Publication success rate of individual members averaged 79%. This exceeds the 30–40% acceptance rate for scholarly journals worldwide. Group members published an average of 5.2 papers per member, with some publishing as few as 2–3 papers and others as many as 10–11. Lessons Learned: An informal, low-resource writing program in medical school departments can help faculty reach their publication goals. We found that members were satisfied by having the group help them publish whatever number of papers they decided to write. The program’s simple, informal approach fostered a culture of respectful and collegial interactions, in which members learned to depend on and accept critiques from colleagues.

However, medical education has historically excluded LGBTQIA + health-related content in formal curricula. It is common for medical students to interact with diverse patient populations through clinical rotations; however, access to and knowledge about LGBTQIA + patients is inconsistently prioritized in medical schools. This is especially true for LGBTQIA + patients with intersecting historically marginalized identities, such as people of color and people with disabilities. Learning from and listening to medically underserved community members can help both medical students and educators better understand the unique health needs of these communities, and address implicit biases to improve health care and outcomes for their patients. Intervention: To address the lack of LGBTQIA + health-related content in medical education and improve access to and knowledge about LGBTQIA + patients, LGBTQIA + community members’ perspectives and lived experiences were integrated into undergraduate medical education via four primary methods: Community Advisory Groups, community panel events, standardized patients, and community member interviews. Context: LGBTQIA + community members’ perspectives and lived experiences were integrated into medical education at Harvard Medical School (HMS) as part of the HMS Sexual and Gender Minority Health Equity Initiative. Impact: LGBTQIA + community members’ perspectives and lived experiences were successfully integrated into multiple aspects of medical education at HMS. During this process, we navigated challenges in the following areas that can inform similar efforts at other institutions: representation of diverse identities and experiences, meeting and scheduling logistics, structural barriers in institutional processes, and implementation of community member recommendations. Lessons Learned: Based on our experiences, we offer recommendations for integrating LGBTQIA + community members’ perspectives into medical education. Engaging community members and integrating their perspectives into medical education will better enable medical educators at all institutions to teach students about the health care needs of LGBTQIA + communities, and better prepare medical students to provide affirming and effective care to their future patients, particularly those who are LGBTQIA+. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133255973"

Background: It is broadly agreed that medical students should become self-directed lifelong learners to succeed as physicians. To that end, many instruments have been developed that measure student attributes of self-directed learning (SDL). By contrast, no such analogous valid instrument is available to assess faculty familiarity in pedagogical strategies to promote SDL among students. Approach: An item bank with 45 items was created and its content-related validity evaluated by a panel of twenty experts. The items were selected and validated in the framework of Item Response Theory (IRT). The unidimensionality of all items within four constructs was assessed by using modified parallel analysis and 2 parameter IRT model calibration. The final version of the Recognition of Learning-Oriented Teaching Strategies (RoLOTS) instrument was validated by using the IRT marginal reliability as well as 2PL model calibrations. Different Item Functioning (DIF) in student-educators and gender was examined. Findings: The final version of RoLOTS included 20 items, with five in each of four subdomains: building content knowledge; the emotional and motivational aspects of learning; leveraging the social nature of the learning process; and metacognitive processes that promote student regulation of the learning process. Construct validity and reliability of each of the four domains were well supported by the results. Significant DIF was not detected in student-educator and gender. Conclusions: The RoLOTS successfully evaluated whether a faculty member is familiar with pedagogical tools to promote medical students’ self-directed learning, which can be used as a first step in needs-based professional development. Further research is needed to provide more validity and reliability evidence among groups with diverse SDL experience. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117165339"

To address this need, an increasing number of medical schools are implementing separate rural or urban underserved training programs or tracks. Intervention: The Rural and Urban Scholars Pathways program is designed as an integrated program, not as separated tracks, and includes critical reflection groups, professional development workshops, individual coaching, a scholarly project, and immersion experiences. The program does not separate students by initial interest in either rural or urban underserved practice settings, but rather promotes their interactions across all four years. Students can join (or leave) RUSP in any year of medical school and, although strongly encouraged toward eventual practice in an underserved community, students are not committed to a specific specialty or practice location. Context: The RUSP program was developed and implemented at the Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine at Ohio University in 2013 with a grant from the Osteopathic Heritage Foundations. The program resides within the Office of Rural and Underserved Programs at the Heritage College and is one of many medical school programs across the country aimed at producing more physicians for rural and urban underserved communities. RUSP is now funded by the College. Impact: Overall, based on a 60% return rate in 2019–2020, students in all four years report that the RUSP program enhances their professional, personal, social, and academic development. Cumulatively, 67% have matched into specialties with primary care potential, including family medicine, pediatrics, general internal medicine and internal medicine-pediatrics. Of the 14 RUSP graduates in practice, six are practicing primary care in rural locations and five are practicing primary care in urban locations. Five of the fourteen are practicing in communities officially designated as underserved. Lessons Learned: Offering flexibility via a pathways model promotes continuing individual and program growth and expansion. A co-curricular strategy allows for nimble program refinement but requires significant volunteer time commitment from faculty and staff. Having clear program goals, a logic model, and mechanisms for gathering and analyzing student experiences help to maintain program focus and allow for ongoing formative and periodic summative evaluation of short-term and long-term objectives. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124885083"

Change efforts often struggle and some fail due to well-articulated challenges as well as other barriers less understood. The curricular change literature characterizes the organizational and operational features of successful change yet virtually ignores stakeholder emotions. A deeper understanding of these emotional responses during the change process could enhance participant and organizational well-being and support change success. Approach In 2019, data were collected at one large North American medical school using group concept mapping methodology, an asynchronous mixed methods approach. We sought to generate themes characterizing the emotional responses of faculty, administrative staff, and students across multiple stakeholder groups participating in the new and traditional (legacy) curricula 27 months after curricular change initiation. Participants brainstormed, sorted, and rated statements on emotional responses. Rating participants rated each statement using a Likert scale from 1 (does not resonate) to 4 (very strongly resonates) according to this prompt: “This emotional response resonates with my emotional experience during the curricular change.” Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses were used to generate emotional profiles and compare them across stakeholders. Findings Of 335 stakeholders invited, 123 contributed to brainstorming (36.7%), 153 completed rating (45.7%) and 33 completed sorting (9.9%). Participants generated six themes of emotional responses to curricular change: enthusiastic, apprehensive, overwhelmed, missed opportunities, uncertain, and abandoned. The enthusiastic theme overall had the highest mean statement ratings while the abandoned theme had the lowest. Demographic subgroup analysis revealed new curriculum students (Class of 2021) were most enthusiastic while legacy curriculum students (Class of 2020) were more likely to feel abandoned. Overall, faculty and administrative staff were more enthusiastic than students whereas students rated the five other themes higher than faculty and administrative staff. InsightsCurricular change is emotionally taxing. Students in both curricula experienced greater uncertainty, apprehension, sense of missed opportunities, and feeling overwhelmed than did faculty and administrative staff. Legacy curriculum students rated statements in the abandoned cluster highest while new curriculum students rated statements in the enthusiastic cluster highest. Given the ubiquity of curricular change which often includes a legacy cohort, medical schools embarking on this journey must carefully attend to the varied emotional responses of their different stakeholder groups. The very activities recommended by organizational change models used in medical education, such as communicating wins early and often, could alienate legacy students, creating emotional polarization. These findings suggest that tailored communication strategies are necessary during change implementation to optimize success. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123506383"

The 16 items on the OLBI-MS are split to form two subscales, disengagement and exhaustion. Background: Medical student burnout has been empirically linked to several detrimental professional and personal consequences. In recognition of the high prevalence of medical student burnout, one recommendation has been to regularly measure burnout using standardized measures that have strong validity evidence for their intended use. The OLBI-MS, a frequently used measure of medical student burnout, was adapted from the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI). The OLBI has been studied in many occupational settings and been found to have a two-factor solution in majority of these populations, but there is limited validity evidence available that supports the use of the OLBI-MS subscales in a medical student population. Approach: Two years of Association of American Medical College Year 2 Questionnaire data (n = 24,008) were used in the study for a series of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The data from the first year (n = 11,586) was randomly split into a confirmatory and exploratory sample, with the data from the second year (n = 12,422) used as a secondary confirmatory sample. Because the questionnaire is administered to medical students during their second year of undergraduate medical education, we consider this a study as providing validity evidence specifically for the measure’s use with that population. Findings: The two-factor structure of the OLBI-MS was not empirically supported in the second year medical-student population. Several of the items had low inter-item correlations and/or moderate correlations with unexpected items. Three modified versions of the OLBI-MS were tested using subsets of the original items. Two of the modified versions were adequate statistical explanations of the relationships in the data. However, it is unclear if these revised scales appropriately measure all aspects of the construct of burnout and additional validity evidence is needed prior to their use. Conclusions: The use of the OLBI-MS is not recommended for measuring second-year medical student burnout. It is unclear if the OLBI-MS is appropriate for medical students at all, or if different measures are necessary at different stages in a medical student’s professional development. Additional research is needed to either improve the OLBI-MS or use it as a foundation for a new measure.

Care is a foundational concept of health care education, and if we do not take control of our basic concepts, their meaning can be subject to other influences. We take a philosophical approach to care and ask what care is, to connect different conceptions of care in health care education to their common root. We do this by first examining how the concept is used in health care education, how it features in Martin Heidegger’s Being and Time, and finally, how these philosophical implications may be applied to medical education. Evidence: The use of care in medical education suggests that it is foundational to understanding health care education. However, presently the concept is ambiguous and risks being a ‘container concept’ that becomes meaningless because it is used generally. In publications that feature the concept, it is usually in service of another aspect that is under investigation, and not care itself. For instance, publications on teaching patient-centred care focus on the meaning of ‘patient-centeredness’ rather than care. In ‘health care’, there are debates about what ‘health’ means, but not care. The concept is also used in different and sometimes contradictory meanings: care as the organizational structure of health care that safeguards (health care system), care as empathy or careful attention of medical trainees for patients (caring about one’s patients, treating them carefully), and, finally, care as motivation and focus toward a goal (caring about graduating, making a contribution). We turn to the philosophy of Heidegger to integrate these different appearances of care into a unified structure. Heidegger’s Being and Time describes care as the basic ontological structure of human existence. This turns out to be a structure of time: in the familiar structure of past present and future. Anticipating a future end, which determines our attitude toward the people, objects, and physical structures we are with now, and in the light of which we orient ourselves to what is already there. Implications: By describing the ontological (foundational) structure of care, we argue that care is the spirit of health care education. This unifying structure can be used to integrate phenomena that are recognized as important in health care education but are usually seen as separate. We use an example to illustrate how empathy, health protocols, and educational goals can be connected in one situation. Just as health provides a framework for patient management, care can provide this framework for education. This fundamental concept of care can be used in practice for reflection on anticipated ends in situations in which different modes of care seemingly conflict. Beyond our focus on care, we also illustrate how one can take an important concept in health care education and use philosophy to root it in a foundational understanding of that concept. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130591297"

In this case, validity evidence for test scores’ uses and interpretations is of utmost importance, because of the consequences for everyone involved in their development and implementation. Background: Educational assessment requires an appropriate understanding and use of validity frameworks; however, health professions educators still struggle with the conceptual challenges of validity, and frequently validity analyses have a narrow focus. Important obstacles are the plurality of validity frameworks and the difficulty of grounding these abstract concepts in practice. Approach: We reviewed the validity frameworks literature to identify the main elements of frequently used models (Messick and Kane’s) and proposed linking frameworks including Russell’s recent overarching proposal. Examples are provided with commonly used assessment instruments in health professions education. Findings: Several elements in these frameworks can be integrated into a common approach, matching and aligning Messick’s sources of validity with Kane’s four inference types.

While research on cadaver-based simulation has largely focused on exploring student attitudes and reactions or measuring improvements in procedural performance, the ethical, philosophical, and experiential aspects of teaching and learning with cadavers are rarely discussed. In this paper, we shed new light on the fascinating philosophical moves in which people engage each and every time they find themselves face to face with a cadaver. ApproachOver a two-year period (2018/19–2019/20), we applied ethnographic methods (137 hours of observation, 24 interviews, and the analysis of 22 documents) to shadow the educational cadaver through the practical stages involved in cadaver-based simulation: 1. cadaver preparation, 2. cadaver-based skill practice with physicians and residents, and 3. interment and memorial services. We used Deleuze and Guattari’s concepts of becoming and acts of creation to trace the ontological “lifecycle” of an educational cadaver as embedded within everyday work practices. FindingsWe delineated six sub-phases of the lifecycle, through which the cadaver transformed ontologically from person to donor, body, cadaver, educational cadaver, teacher, and loved one/legacy. These shifts involved a network of bureaucratic, technical, educational, and humanistic practices that shaped the way the cadaver was perceived and acted upon at different moments in the lifecycle. By highlighting, at each phase, 1) the ontological transitions of the cadaver, itself, and 2) the practices, events, settings, and people involved in each of these transitions, we explored questions of “being” as it related to the ontological ambiguity of the cadaver: its conceptualization as both person and tool, simultaneously representing life and death. InsightsEngaging deeply with the philosophical questions of cadaver-based simulation (CBS) helped us conceptualize the lifecycle as a series of meaningful and purposeful acts of becoming. Following the cadaver from program entry to interment allowed us to contemplate how its ontological ambiguity shapes every aspect of cadaver-based simulation. We found that in discussions of fidelity in medical simulation, beyond both the physical and functional, it is possible to conceive of a third type: ontological. The humanness of the cadaver makes CBS a unique, irreplaceable, and inherently philosophical, practice. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133226528"

Prior efforts to understand who chooses to take part in pro bono and why they might do so have been primarily atheoretical in their approach. The current investigation focuses on students in medical school and draws on relevant theory and research in psychology to identify predictors of their intentions to engage in medical pro bono service during and after medical school. Hypotheses:Four major approaches to identifying predictors of medical pro bono are examined: the role of demographic variables as predictors of medical pro bono, conceptualizing medical pro bono as a form of volunteerism, viewing medical pro bono as an expression of personality, and medical pro bono as a reflection of role identities and expectations. Each of these approaches can be characterized as being about medical students’ individual attributes or aspects of the situation they are in. Methods: A total of 278 medical students from 15 different medical schools in the United States of America completed a web-based survey (8/4/2020–9/22/2020). The students completed measures of pro bono identity and expectations, intentions to engage in medical pro bono activities, prosocial personality, volunteer motivation, exposure to volunteering, general traits of personality, and demographic variables (in this order). We used linear regression analyses to separately predict three measures of intentions (general medical school intentions, intentions toward medical pro bono trips during medical school, and general post medical school intentions). Results: The strongest predictors of intentions to engage in medical pro bono were one’s identity and expectations related to pro bono. Medical students who had incorporated medical pro bono into aspects of their identity and/or considered medical pro bono to be an expectation indicated higher intentions to engage in medical pro bono work. Conversely, volunteer motivation/exposure, personality, and demographic variables were much weaker predictors of medical pro bono. Conclusions: The findings of the present study have implications for ways that medically oriented volunteering may be increased by individual-level interventions and/or changes in medical education. Individual-level interventions could leverage the importance of identity and expectations to craft persuasive messaging to appeal to identity and expectations as drivers of engagement in medical pro bono. Program level interventions could work toward the institutionalization of medical pro bono by the inclusion/promotion of medical pro bono into the program’s co-curricular and/or extracurricular activities. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126685481"

Social isolation and perceptions of not belonging can negatively impact students’ academic performance and well-being. Therefore, interventions are needed to support students and these efforts should be appealing, brief, and low-burden. Intervention: Guided by evidence-based approaches, we developed the Build & Belong intervention for medical students as a brief peer-to-peer approach that consisted of four components. First, M3 and M4 students wrote reflections on belonging in medical school. Second, M3 and M4 students video recorded messages for M1 and M2 students using their written reflections. Third, M1 and M2 students watched and discussed the videos in small groups. Fourth, the M1 and M2 students wrote letters to future students. Our intervention differs from previous student belonging interventions in the peer delivery of messages. Context: The Build & Belong intervention aimed to improve medical students’ social belongingness. Using a longitudinal observational study design, the intervention was piloted at a medical school in the Mid-Atlantic United States in 2017-2018. Students completed surveys before and after the intervention. Paired samples tests (t-tests and Wilcoxon) assessed pre- to post-intervention changes in social isolation, social connectedness, and social assurance. Impact: Among 63 medical students, with 25.9% from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine, we assessed follow-up outcomes in 38 students. Social isolation scores significantly decreased from baseline (M = 54.8, SD = 7.06) to follow-up (M = 51.3, SD = 6.67; p <.001). Social isolation changes were evident regardless of sex, although males reported a greater reduction (M Δ = −5.32, p <.001) than females (M Δ = −2.79, p =.014). Black/African American students had the largest reduction in social isolation (M Δ = −7.24, p =.010). Social assurance and connectedness scores did not change significantly between baseline and follow-up. Medical students appeared to resonate with messages delivered by more experienced peers (M3s and M4s), particularly messages that normalized feelings of not belonging and strategies to reduce those feelings. Lessons Learned: The Build & Belong intervention appears to reduce social isolation scores among medical students. This pilot test of the Build & Belong intervention provides initial evidence of the effectiveness of a brief, low-cost intervention. Build & Belong may provide a scalable strategy to reduce medical students’ social isolation. Our peer-based approach is distinct from administrator-led strategies; peers were seen as trusted and reliable sources of information about belonging and ways to overcome the challenges experienced during medical school. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119249038"

As CLEs sit at the crossroads of education and healthcare delivery, leadership from both entities should share the responsibility and accountability for this work. Current data collection about the experience and outcomes for learners, faculty, staff, and patients tends to occur in fragmented and siloed ways, and available tools to assess clinical learning environments are limited in scope. In addition, from an organizational perspective oversight of education and patient care is often done by separate entities, and not infrequently is there a sense of competing interests. Intervention: We aimed to design and pilot a holistic approach to assessment and review of CLEs and establish whether such a formative assessment process could be used to engage stakeholders from education, departmental, and health systems leadership in improvement of CLEs. Utilizing concepts of implementation science, we planned and executed a holistic assessment process for CLEs, monitored the impact of the assessment, and reflected on the process. We focused the assessment on four pillars characterizing exemplary learning environments: 1) Environment is inclusive, promotes diversity and collaboration; 2) Focus on continuous quality improvement; 3) Alignment between work and learning; and 4) Integration of education and healthcare mission. Context: At our institution, medical trainees rotate through several different health systems, but clinical and educational leadership converge at the departmental level. We therefore focused this proof-of-concept project on two large clinical departments at our institution, centering on medical learners from undergraduate and graduate medical education. For each department, a small team of champions helped create an assessment grid based on the four pillars and identified existing quantitative evaluation data sources. Champions subsequently collected qualitative data through observations, focus groups, and interviews to fill any gaps in available quantitative data. Impact: The project teams shared reports summarizing findings and recommendations with departmental, clinical, and educational leadership. Subsequent meetings with these stakeholders led to actionable plans for improvement as well as sustained structures for collaborative work between the different stakeholder groups. Lessons Learned: This project demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of collating, analyzing, and sharing data from various sources in engaging different stakeholder groups to initiate actionable improvement plans. Collating quantitative data from existing resources was a powerful way to demonstrate common issues in CLEs, and qualitative data provided further detail to inform improvement initiatives. Other institutions can adapt this approach to guide assessment and quality improvement of CLEs. As a next step, we are creating a comprehensive learning environment scorecard to allow for comparison of clinical learning environment quality across institutions and over time. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136843472"

While inadequate self-reflection impacts future clinical decision-making, it may also adversely impact current learning through an inability to identify learning-behavior deficits. This may be exacerbated by common use of multiple-choice questions (MCQ) where incorrect responses provide less insight than other measures for students, faculty, or academic support. To address this, an Error Reflection Method (ERM) was developed to help students focus on ‘why’ they got an MCQ wrong rather than ‘what’ they got wrong, thereby promoting self-reflection and a learning-focus on assessment. Understanding students’ learning-behavior deficits could also enrich engagement with academic support services and guide curricular design. Intervention: The ERM is a list of 10 common types of exam errors that were either ‘test-taking’ (unwitting) errors or ‘learning-behavior’ errors that reflected learning deficits. The ERM is simple, transferable, and sustainable, allowing longitudinal and regular monitoring of individual and collective error-making to focus support and guide curricular development. Context: Undergraduate medical students at the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine, USA, used the ERM in formative assessment review sessions in pre-clinical years to select an error type that best described the cause of each incorrect response. Impact: Initial findings suggest the ERM is robust and associated with improved student performance and curricular development. Analysis of 3,775 student-identified errors showed the error types in the ERM described 96% of errors students made. Learning-behavior errors were more common (76%), but surprisingly, 19% were test-taking errors, allowing academic support to focus on test-taking skills in a population previously thought of as consummate test-takers. The most common error type reported was ‘the content looked familiar but I couldn’t answer the question’ (32%); which we suggest is consistent with shallow learning. This finding has helped steer recent curricular development toward active and applied learning techniques. Lessons Learned: By formally and regularly identifying learning deficits, students may be more capable of addressing them and improve summative exam performance. As well as focusing academic support, understanding common student errors has been useful in guiding curricular design and content delivery. Further potential of the ERM may be realized in faculty development and directing assessment culture toward a learning focus. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125868107"

Due to its association with burnout and distress, it is progressively being studied in medicine. While various explanations for IP have been discussed in the literature, the role of motivation has largely been neglected. Hypotheses: Using self-determination theory (SDT) as a lens, it was hypothesized that different general causality orientations (impersonal, control, autonomy), domain-specific types of motivation (autonomous vs. controlled) toward going to medical school, and levels of satisfaction of basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, relatedness) in the medical program, would each predict severity of IP symptoms. Method: A total of 1,450 medical students from three Canadian institutions were invited to complete a survey containing the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale and scales derived from SDT’s mini theories: basic psychological needs theory, causality orientations theory, and organismic integration theory. We explored the prevalence of IP among the students and used regression to capture variable relationships, accounting for gender effects. Results: Data from 277 (19.1%) students were assessed, 73% of whom reported moderate or worse IP symptoms. Having an impersonal general causality orientation, more controlled motivation toward going to medical school, and lower need satisfaction in the medical program, each related to increased IP severity. Together, these motivational factors accounted for 30.3%, 13.6%, and 21.8% of the variance in students’ IP severity, respectively. Conclusions: Findings from this study suggest that students who are more self-determined (both in general and in medical school), and whose basic psychological needs are more supported in their medical program, will experience less frequent and severe IP symptoms. Preliminary explanations and implications of these findings are discussed within the medical education context. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129295705"

Historically, assessing communication skills has predominantly relied on itemized scoring, which is less useful for providing meaningful feedback to learners. Even more troublesome, theoretical scoring criteria tend to become a refractive lens allowing observation of only the conduct that aligns with the theory. Few skills assessment efforts have embraced a holistic understanding of how physician-patient communication skills are enacted in real patient care. Therefore, this study focused on what experts refer to when they speak about physicians’ communication skills and what they treat as important when evaluating these skills enacted during real patient encounters. Approach: This qualitative study was based on observations and grounded theory. Residents’ encounters with real patients were recorded as part of a formative communication skills assessment program from July 2015 to June 2016. Evaluation panels with diverse backgrounds (e.g., medicine, education, communication, conversation analysis, and layperson) listened to these recordings and jointly developed feedback comments for the resident from January 2016 to July 2017. For this study, we recorded forty-one panel discussions to observe their consensus evaluation. We conducted open and axial coding using a constant comparison approach to generate themes from the data. Findings: Elements of communication skills were connected and interdependent around the concepts of thoroughness and natural flow, which were not addressed by formative assessment criteria. Themes included (1) thoroughness within a boundary via agenda-setting; (2) natural yet, controlled flow: authentic conversation by active listening and questioning; (3) making agenda setting explicit to all parties in the beginning; (4) designing questions using both open-ended and closed questions; (5) pre-/post-conditions for patient education: patient contextual factors and teach-back; (6) preconditions for shared decision-making: patient education and patient contextual factors; and (7) multifaceted empathy demonstrated in multiple ways. Insights: The main message of the study findings is that communication skills criteria should be treated as organically interrelated and connected in assessing physicians’ communication skills. Current communication skills assessment practice should be revisited as it itemizes physicians’ communication skills as distinct and separate constructs rather than mutually affecting dynamics. Rather than imposing a theoretical rubric, assessment criteria should evolve through naturalistic observations of physician-patient communication. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115234577"

Many residents and physicians do not feel comfortable working with patients with OUD. Social stigma promotes negative attitudes toward these patients and is a roadblock to delivering equitable and effective care. This study sought to (1) characterize medical students’ experiences with patients with OUD, (2) understand the features that make a patient encounter memorable, (3) explore factors that influence future practice, and (4) describe the influence on stigma toward patients with OUD. Approach: A study was conducted using qualitative descriptive theory and purposive sampling of fourth-year medical students (M4s) enrolled at Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSOM). Data collection consisted of a free-text question as a part of a larger survey to M4s in the Class of 2019 and 2020, followed by semi-structured interviews. The goal of the survey was to gain a broad understanding of student encounters with patients with OUD. The goal of the interviews was to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of these encounters on future practice and stigma. Thematic analysis was used to analyze all data. Findings: One-hundred-seventy out of 237 students (RR = 71.7%) completed the free text question describing a memorable encounter with a patient with OUD. Twelve students then completed interviews. Patient encounters occurred in three primary settings: Emergency department, inpatient clerkship, or Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) meetings during psychiatry clerkship. Clinical encounters were memorable when there was: (1) conflict with patients or teams, (2) complicated care, (3) inadequate care, and (4) relevance to the student’s future career. Memorable encounters influenced future practice by changing students’ approaches to: (1) future treatment, (2) future communication, or (3) allowing students to practice professionalism. Regarding opioid stigma, students reported that these encounters made them: (1) more aware of stereotypes in medicine, (2) stereotypes in their personal lives, and (3) generated actions that students want to take in the future. Insights: A single, influential clinical encounter has the potential to substantially influence medical students’ approach to patients with OUD, including both clinical management and attitudes toward care. Affecting encounters increased knowledge of OUD and fostered empathy and perspective-taking. Not all encounters had a defining impact on students’ stigma toward OUD. Medical schools need to create opportunities that will have lasting impact by encouraging students to fully engage with patients with OUD.

Due in part to limited understanding of the root causes of moral distress, little is known about which approaches are most beneficial for mitigating physicians’ distress. Our objective was to describe system-level factors in United States (U.S.) healthcare that contribute to moral distress among pediatric hospitalist attendings and pediatric residents. ApproachIn this qualitative study, we conducted one-on-one semi-structured interviews with pediatric hospitalist attendings and pediatric residents from 4 university-affiliated, freestanding children’s hospitals in the U.S. between August 2019 and February 2020. Data were coded with an iteratively developed codebook, categorized into themes, and then synthesized. FindingsWe interviewed 22 hospitalists and 18 residents. Participants described in detail how the culture of medicine created a context that cultivated moral distress. Norms of medical education and the practice of medicine created conflicts between residents’ strong sense of professional responsibility to serve the best interests of their patients and the expectations of a hierarchical system of decision-making. The corporatization of the U.S. healthcare system created administrative and financial pressures that conflicted with the moral responsibility felt by both residents and hospitalists to provide the care that their patients and families needed. InsightsThese findings highlight the critical role of systemic sources of moral distress. These findings suggest that system-level interventions must supplement existing interventions that target individual health care providers. Preventing and managing moral distress will require a broad approach that addresses systemic drivers, such as the corporatization of medicine, which are entrenched in the culture of medicine. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130005873"

North Americans of Asian ethnicities are at an increased risk of ostracism due to stereotypes labeling them as inherently different to Western cultural norms. We explored Asian Canadian medical trainees’ experiences with ostracism during their clinical training. Approach: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 medical trainees of Asian ethnicities at 3 Canadian medical schools to explore experiences of ostracism and conducted a thematic analysis guided by the theoretical framework of the temporal need threat model of ostracism. Findings: Participants from East-, South-, and Southeast-Asian sub-ethnic groups completed the study. They voiced experiences of being excluded from clinical and social settings. Ostracism was mainly fueled by systemic racism, power dynamics in medical education, and non-diverse training environments. The model minority myth was a significant contributor to experiences of ostracism. Trainees felt their well-being threatened and many felt resigned to accept ostracism going forward. Insights: Ostracism poses a significant threat to the wellbeing and career progression of Asian Canadian medical trainees. Trainees facing covert ostracism were particularly at risk of entering the resignation stage of hopelessness. This underrecognized problem needs to be addressed by institutions to dismantle harmful stereotypes and prejudiced practices facing these minoritized communities. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180428844"

Given the siloed nature of clinical rotations, students often “fall through the cracks” and may repeatedly struggle through clerkships without support and coaching from which they would otherwise benefit. Many institutions have grappled with creating feed forward processes, that is, educational handoffs in which information is shared among faculty about struggling students with the intention of providing longitudinal support to ensure their success, while protecting students from negative bias that may follow them throughout the remainder of their medical school tenure. Evidence: Here, the authors describe the feed forward processes of four medical schools. Each school’s process relies on close collaboration between course directors and deans to identify students and develop intervention plans. Course leadership and administration are typically the primary drivers for long-term follow-up with students. The number of participants in the process varies, with only one school directly involving students. Two schools hold larger, regularly scheduled meetings with up to 12 faculty present in their institution’s feed forward process. Across these institutions, students can “graduate” from the feed forward process once they achieve competency in the areas of concern. Implications: The authors believe the most important outcome achieved is the formalization and adherence to a feed forward process. Thus, risk to students in the form of negative bias is mitigated by the flow of information, the extent to which information is available, and permitting students to be part of the process. These exemplars give insight into variable approaches to feed forward systems adopted by medical schools and demonstrate highly visible methodologies by which educational leadership empower students and educators toward a shared goal of student progress and achievement. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132183319"

Yet, there is limited literature on the development or meaning of these relationships, particularly from the PD perspective. Through qualitative interviews, we explore how PDs navigate their role to develop and maintain relationships with their trainees, and elucidate how these relationships impact the PDs personally and professionally. Approach: Qualitative study using individual semi-structured interviews of former and current PDs (n = 33) from multiple specialties and hospitals in accredited residency programs in Qatar, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates. We used attachment theory and narrative analysis to investigate how PDs perceive and describe relationship building with their residents amidst tensions of familiarizing themselves with their new role. Findings: PD-resident relationships are complex and multidimensional, shifting over time, changing patterns and evolving to respond to different contexts. PDs initially negotiate their own roles, while navigating their relationships with residents and other stakeholders to create their professional identities. PDs develop professional alliances, defining for the resident the profession and its expectations. As residents negotiate the various challenges of their training, the role of the PD emerges into one of providing emotional support and advocacy. The support and attachment are often enduring and extend beyond the period of residency training. Insights: Our study examines the experiences of program directors as they negotiate complex educator-learner relationships. The PDs described roles that extended beyond their job description. Although all interviewees reported that the PD position was challenging, they focused on the rewarding aspects of the job and how their relationships helped sustain them through the difficulties. Through their reflections, the PDs described the personal satisfaction and benefits of their interactions with the residents, and how the engagement contributed to personal and professional success. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120040938"

This manuscript elaborates on existing conceptual frameworks in order to support CME practitioners, funders, and policy makers to develop, implement, and evaluate CME vis-a-vis population health concerns. Evidence: Existing CME conceptual models and conceptions of CME effectiveness require elaboration in order to meet goals of population health improvement. Frameworks for the design, implementation and evaluation of CME consistently reference population health, but do not adequately conceptualize it beyond the aggregation of individual patient health. As a pertinent example, opioid prescribing CME programs use the opioid epidemic to justify their programs, but evaluation approaches are inadequate for demonstrating population health impacts. CME programs that are built to have population health outcomes using frameworks intended primarily for physician performance and patient health outcomes are thus not able to recognize either non-linear associations or negative unintended consequences. Implications: This proposed conceptual framework draws on the fields of clinical population medicine, the social determinants of health, health equity, and philosophies of population health to build conceptual bridges between the CME outcome levels of physician performance and patient health to population health. The authors use their experience developing, delivering, and evaluating opioid prescribing- and poverty-focused CME programs to argue that population health-focused CME must be re-oriented in at least five ways. These include: 1) scaling effective CME programs while evaluating at population health levels; 2) (re)interpreting evidence for program content from a population perspective; 3) incorporating social determinants of health into clinically-oriented CME activities; 4) explicitly building fluency in population health concepts and practices among health care providers and CME planners; and 5) attending to social inequity in every aspect of CME programs. © 2021 The Author(s).

This study determined the online presence of US-based residency training programs during this time period. Approach: An official list of accredited US residency programs for 24 medical specialties was obtained through the Electronic Residency Application Service Programs’ online presence and was evaluated for website ownership in addition to Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook account ownership. Date of social media account foundation and virtual opportunities offered were recorded. Doximity Residency Navigator for 2020–2021 was used to determine program rank, and programs were stratified by location using Association of American Medical Colleges regions. Program rank and geographic location were used to determine potential trends in online presence. This study was performed during the residency application cycle from September 2, 2020, to November 29, 2020, during which applications were submitted and the interview cycle began. Findings: Fifty-seven percent of the 4,562 programs had a presence on social media. One-third of all accounts were created after March 1, 2020, and most (58%) were residency program–associated. A total of 1,315 programs offered virtual open houses through Twitter (829), Instagram (792), and Facebook (295). First-quartile programs had significantly more social media accounts per program on average (1.8) than those in subsequent quartiles, and Western region programs had significantly more accounts per program on average (1.3) than the Central (1.0), Northeastern (1.0), and Southern (1.1) regions. Insights: US residency programs created social media accounts and online opportunities for applicants following March 1, 2020. Online interactions may serve as substitutes at a time when in-person interaction is not possible. Future studies may examine the influence and impact of virtual interactions.

The former is grounded in the more general concept of identity, intended as an internalized set of role expectations. Some have proposed frameworks based on psychological or sociological approaches, but empirical research is still scarce and often limited to the exploration of the role of specific learning activities. The pandemic imposed adaptations that produced an artificial setting for a social experiment, suitable to observe how the deprivation of the social component of a student’s life, such as in presence teaching and practical training, unveiled the elements and determinants of the developing identity of medical students. Approach: This research was the extension of a previous phenomenological study about medical students’ lived experience of distance learning during the lockdown phase in Italy. We adopted a hermeneutic approach to furtherly deepen the analysis of the phenomenon at stake, in dialogue with the relevant literature. Eight 6th year medical students underwent an in-depth interview, themes were inductively generated and used to identify elements and determinants of the developing identities. Findings: Four themes developed, synthetized in the overarching theme “From crawling to standing on your feet and walking toward an uncertain future”. The themes were: “social places and practices that make me feel like a student and a medical student”, “toward self-regulation”, “an emotional journey”, “threats to the identity”. The elements of the perceived identity as a medical student were autonomy and learning self-regulation, professional knowledge, competence, and sense of belonging to a community. The determinant factors which influenced the identity as a medical student were living environment, learning spaces and architectures, the social networks, the attendance of the healthcare facilities, the relationship with teachers, the social acknowledgement as a medical student, and as a doctor. Insights: It was possible to identify the generation of both constitutive elements of identity and determinants influencing identity development and this distinction is an added value of the research. According Gilles Deleuze’s concept of “empty square” (the sudden lack of an object one used to have at hand: sociality in this case), this research highlighted the ambivalent nature of identity. Individualization and socialization are the “uneven sides” of that same paradoxical object which is identity. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132371244"

Experiencing harassment can have significant consequences for trainees in multiple domains, including mental, physical, social, and occupational well-being. Harassment remains entrenched in medical education despite efforts to address it. Evidence: Many articles have documented the prevalence of harassment in medical education. Likewise, articles have provided recommendations for how individuals or hospitals can attempt to reduce harassment. However, despite calls for reform, harassment persists, largely due to the hierarchical, paternalistic, high-pressure, and evaluative nature of medical culture. Most literature has emphasized the need for policies and reporting structures, yet such top-down initiatives have not had a sufficient impact on the attitudes and beliefs that drive culture change. Instead, change requires intervention at every level of an organization. Little, if any, literature has proposed applying a change management model to change the culture of medical training and therefore decrease harassment. Implications: This paper applies principles of organizational change theory, and in particular, the ADKAR model, in conjunction with a summary of the existing harassment literature, to propose a framework for addressing harassment by facilitating organizational culture change. Intervention is needed at all levels of the medical education system (the healthcare system, the supervisor or training program, and the individual), and the ADKAR framework can guide what interventions are offered and when to capitalize on the current level of change readiness. Recommendations go beyond the typical focus on formalized policies and procedures, which are necessary, but not sufficient, components of culture change. Implementation of these practices, as well as ongoing evaluation and refinement through research, should foster cultural change in medical education to address harassment. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114624484"

The critical role of trainee specialty has also been overlooked, despite the unique personal and work-based stressors faced among subgroups–such as those completing Family Medicine/General Practice. A consolidation of intervention research can help to guide the design, implementation and evaluation of future targeted programs and potentially enhance their effectiveness. The present hermeneutic literature review addresses this gap. Approach: The Embase, Ovid Medline, and Ovid PsycINFO databases were searched for articles exploring wellbeing and related concepts of burnout and stress amongst Family Medicine/General Practice trainees. Thirty-one studies were identified through seven iterative rounds, with articles that offered novel insights and/or addressed knowledge gaps identified in each round and analyzed, followed by refinement of the overarching coding structure. Thematic analysis was conducted by two researchers. Findings: Proposed and enacted wellbeing interventions typically involved a combination of individualistic (e.g., self-awareness), organizational (e.g., increasing policy flexibility), and cultural (e.g., leadership) strategies. Change mechanisms were interpersonal (e.g., comradery) and, to a greater extent, intrapersonal (e.g., normalizing and accepting feelings of insecurity). Key delivery methods included the need to ingrain trainee wellness into daily work life and the importance of contextualizing interventions to increase their relevance, acceptance, and effectiveness. Insights: The present review identifies and consolidates key mechanisms of change intrinsic to wellbeing-promotion interventions, alongside delivery methods. These findings provide guidance for practice and research to identify these attributes of interventions in the design and evaluation stages. This, in turn, will enhance the clarity of what is being evaluated, facilitating more informed comparisons between evaluations.

Kern Institute for the Transformation of Medical Education at Medical College of Wisconsin, Wauwatosa, WI, United States","Construct: The construct being assessed is readiness-for-residency of graduating medical students, as measured through two assessment frameworks. Background: Readiness-for-residency of near-graduate medical students should be but is not consistently assessed. To address this, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), in 2014, identified and described 13 core Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs), which are tasks that all residents should be able to perform unsupervised upon entering residency. However, the AAMC did not initially provide measurement guidelines or propose standardized assessments. We designed Night-onCall (NOC), an immersive simulation for our near-graduating medical students to assess and address their readiness-for-residency, framed around tasks suggested by the AAMC’s core EPAs. In adopting this EPA assessment framework, we began by building upon an established program of competency-based clinical skills assessments, repurposing competency-based checklists to measure components of the EPAs where possible, and designing new checklists, when necessary. This resulted in a blended suite of 14 checklists, which theoretically provide substantive assessment of all 13 core EPAs. In this paper, we describe the consensus-based mapping process conducted to ensure we understood the relationship between competency and EPA-based assessment lenses and could therefore report meaningful feedback on both to transitioning students in the NOC exercise. Approach: Between January-November 2017, five clinician and two non-clinician health professions educators at NYU Grossman School of Medicine conducted a rigorous consensus-based mapping process, which included each rater mapping each of the 310 NOC competency-based checklist items to lists of entrustable behaviors expected of learners according to the AAMC 13 core EPAs. Findings: All EPAs were captured to varying degrees by the 14 NOC checklists (overall Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) = 0.77). Consensus meetings resolved discrepancies and improved ICC values for three (EPA-9, EPA-10, EPA-12) of the four EPAs that initially showed poor reliability. Conclusions: Findings suggest that with some limitations (e.g., EPA-7 “form clinical questions/retrieve evidence”) established competency-based assessments can be repurposed to measure readiness-for-residency through an EPA lens and both can be reported to learners and faculty. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131595362"

Edward Hebert School of Medicine, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD, United States","Issue: The intersection of being a Black Woman in Medicine is a unique experience that exacerbates racial trauma and can lead to the hypervigilance, withdrawal, and emotional exhaustion that many minority students experience. Yet, there are not enough avenues for medical students like myself to healthily explore and heal from their experiences. I propose that qualitative research mentorship might be one such avenue. Evidence: It was neither my Black identity nor my female identity alone that isolated me: there were a handful of other Black students, and my school had matriculated a class that had equal numbers of men and women. Instead, it was the intersection of being Black and a woman that was unique and specific to me. As the only Black Woman in my cohort of almost 200 people, I took on a research project investigating the experiences of other Black learners. It was not until I sought out and cultivated mentors to guide me through conducting this research that I was positioned as a storyteller and a visionary to encourage future generations of those underrepresented in medicine to heal through sharing their stories and starting a ripple of change. It was empowering specifically because the qualitative research was specific to my experience. These interviews confirmed that my experience was not felt in isolation, and that I was not the only Black student doubting my abilities, qualifications, and right to be in medical school. Implication: Implementing formal qualitative mentorship programs, where medical schools encourage learners to explore some of the difficult and personal parts of their identities that address these intersections and support them, will ultimately make the universities healthier and create belonging for all students. Sharing stories through qualitative research has helped me (a) create positive experiences to achieve personal healing, (b) reveal systemic inequities, explain my individual experiences, and (c) develop agency and power to make change. Research became my most powerful coping tool and it can be just as powerful and healing for other underrepresented in medicine students. The framework I have provided can be used by institutions and faculty who strive to facilitate that healing. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110508963"

The purpose of this interdisciplinary study was to provide a critical inventory of virtual resources for medical Spanish education, thereby providing a panorama of the current state of online medical Spanish. Approach: Research team members conducted iterative searches to identify medical Spanish online resources, which were then screened for predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Between June and August 2020, a panel of medical and language experts then adapted and applied a previously published evaluation tool to determine whether resources that met study criteria would help learners achieve medical Spanish core competencies and to what extent each resource incorporated communicative language activities. Consensus meetings were conducted to resolve disagreements and identify gaps in online education. Findings: Out of 465 resources, 127 were further screened, and eight were selected for evaluation. Medical and language specialists independently scored each resource and, following discussions, achieved consensus. Overall, no resource met suitability criteria for all five medical Spanish learner competencies or cultural elements, and only one was suitable for achieving the self-assessment competency. Insights: Interdisciplinary consensus meetings provide an important avenue for resolving differences of opinion and for integrating both language and medical perspectives into the evaluation process. Existing online resources should be used in conjunction with other materials to ensure that all core competencies for medical Spanish education are addressed. This study revealed important gaps in online resources, including a need to target advanced Spanish learners, apply authentic communicative activities, include assessment opportunities, and integrate culture in the learning program. Based on the current state of online medical Spanish, we offer recommendations for future resources. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114817862"

Previous studies indicate that medical students’ note writing skills are poor due to a lack of formal clinical documentation instruction. Barriers to formally teaching students how to write patient notes include the significant time burden and variability in faculty feedback. Implementing a near-peer teaching program to teach students how to write a patient note can overcome these barriers and fill this curricular gap. Intervention: Fourth year medical students who completed a Teaching in Medicine elective course were trained to provide individual feedback to 1st and 2nd year students on note writing as a part of their Introduction to Clinical Medicine course. In order to determine the effect of this two year, near-peer feedback program on note writing skills, we analyzed students’ scores on the note writing portion of two Objective Structured Clinical Exams that took place at the end of the 2nd and 3rd years of medical school. Context: The near-peer feedback sessions were implemented in the Fall of 2013 during the preclinical years of the medical school curriculum. Data from students who received near-peer feedback (N = 112) were compared to a historical control group who did not receive near-peer feedback on their note writing (N = 110). Objective Structured Clinical Exam scores that were specific to note writing skills, including the history, physical exam, and differential diagnosis subscales were examined. Impact: The near-peer feedback had a positive impact on the quality of patient notes. On the end of the 2nd year Objective Structured Clinical Exam, the near-peer feedback intervention group outperformed the no feedback group on the history and physical exam subscale scores but not on the differential diagnosis subscale score. One year later, the near-peer feedback intervention group continued to outperform the no feedback group on the physical exam subscale score, but not the history or the differential diagnosis subscale scores. Lessons Learned: Near-peer teaching improves student documentation of the history and physical exam, however only the effects on the physical exam portion persist into the clinical years of training. Writing up a differential diagnosis is a skill that develops through the clerkship experience regardless of exposure to feedback in the preclinical years. Implementing near-peer teaching in the medical school setting is feasible and can provide students with valuable learning experiences without relying on clinical faculty. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136408718"

However, the use of demographic identifiers such as race, ethnicity, region, and descent from one of these groups as mental shortcuts in association with disease can perpetuate misconceptions about the construction of these identities and reinforce stereotypes. The United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Step 1 is a major driver of pre-clinical undergraduate medical education that requires memorization of a large volume of information and application of this information to clinical vignettes. This study assesses how demographic identifiers have been used in a nearly universally used study resource for this exam. Approach: The authors analyzed First Aid for the USMLE Step 1 2020, Thirtieth Edition, a resource that contains “high yield facts” and was built and maintained based on experiences with the USMLE Step 1 for references to race, ethnicity, region, and descent from one of these groups and the distribution of skin tones used in photos. These findings were subsequently compared to the changes made in the 2021 edition of the resource. Findings: The authors found 50 references in the 2020 edition to race, ethnicity, region, and descent from one of these groups, all in relation to disease. More than half of these references had an associated heritable component. Black or African American race was disproportionately represented, comprising more than half of all racial associations (13/24). Additionally, light skin tone was used in 170/204 photos (84.2%) in the 2020 edition. In the 2021 edition, only 12/209 photos (5.7%) were new or changed. Insights: These findings highlight the trend to associate race with disease while also furthering the misconception that there are innate, heritable differences between socially constructed groups and establishing light skin tone as the norm. While some favorable changes were made to the 2021 text, further work within this resource and across medical education is required to avoid further misuse of race and challenge existing implicit biases. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131364451"

Cultures of assessment also shape identities, social relations, and the knowledge and behavior recognized as legitimate by a profession. Therefore, the combination of technology and assessment within medical education is worthy of review. Online proctoring services have become more prevalent during the Covid-19 pandemic, as a means of continuing high-stakes invigilated examinations online. With criticisms about increased surveillance, discrimination, and the outsourcing of control to commercial vendors, is this simply “moving exams online”, or are there more serious implications? What can this extreme example tell us about how our technologies of assessment influence relationships between trainees and medical education institutions? Evidence: We combine postdigital and postphenomenology approaches to analyze the written component of the 2020 online proctored United Kingdom Royal College of Physicians (MRCP) membership exam. We examine the scripts, norms, and trust relations produced through this example of online proctoring, and then locate them in historical and economic contexts. We find that the proctoring service projects a false objectivity that is undermined by the tight script with which examinees must comply in an intensified norm of surveillance, and by the interpretation of digital data by unseen human proctors. Nonetheless, such proctoring services are promoted by an image of data-driven innovation, a rhetoric of necessity in response to a growing problem of online cheating, and an aversion, within medical education institutions, to changing assessment formats (and thus the need to accept different forms of knowledge as legitimate). Implications: The use of online proctoring technology by medical education institutions intensifies established norms, already present within examinations, of surveillance and distrust. Moreover, it exacerbates tensions between conflicting agendas of commercialization, accountability, and the education of trustworthy professionals. Our analysis provides an example of why it is important to stop and consider the holistic implications of introducing technological “solutions”, and to interrogate the intersection of technology and assessment practices in relation to the wider goals of medical education. © 2022 The Author(s).

Metacognition, simply put, is thinking about one’s thinking. Having a metacognitive habit of mind is essential for healthcare professionals. This study identified the metacognitive competencies of medical students as they completed a conceptual learning task, and provided insight into students’ perceptions of self-regulated learning in their curriculum. Approach: Eleven third-year medical students from a Dutch University were purposively sampled to participate in this qualitative study. The study design included a think-aloud assignment followed by a semi-structured interview. During the assignment, participants were instructed to think aloud while solving questions about medical physiological concepts such as blood flow, pressure, and resistance. Think-aloud data were collected through audiotaping and used to identify participants’ metacognitive competencies. The assignment also served as a prompt for an interview in which participants were questioned about metacognitive knowledge, monitoring, experiences, and perceptions of self-regulated learning in their curriculum. All data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed iteratively using a template analysis. Findings: Students differed in their use of metacognitive skills, with an overall focus on monitoring and, to a lesser extent, on planning and evaluation. Additionally, differences were found in students’ metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive experiences. There was apparent use of inefficient, superficial predictive cues. Regarding perceptions of self-regulated learning skills, some students felt no need to develop such skills as they perceived medical education as an exercise in memorizing facts. Others emphasized the need for more insight into their actual level of knowledge and competence. Insights: Pre-clinical medical students require explicit teaching of metacognitive skills to facilitate self-regulated learning. Educators should aim to integrate metacognition in the everyday discourse of the classroom to foster an environment in which students discuss their own learning.

Intentional design of the data collection can enable iterative testing of an instructional design. In this study, we propose that across a population of learners the information from multiple choice question responses can help to identify which design features are associated with positive learner engagement. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that, within an online module that presents serial knowledge content, measures of click-level behavior will show sufficient, but variable, association with a test-measure so as to potentially guide instructional design. Method: The Aquifer online learning platform employs interactive approaches to enable effective learning of health professions content. A multidisciplinary focus group of experts identified potential learning analytic measures within an Aquifer learning module, including: hyperlinks clicked (yes/no), magnify buttons clicked (yes/no), expert advice links clicked (yes/no), and time spent on each page (seconds). Learning analytics approaches revealed which click-level data was correlated with the subsequent relevant Case MCQ. We report regression coefficients where the dependent variable is student accuracy on the Case MCQ as a general indicator of successful engagement. Results: Clicking hyperlinks, magnifying images, clicking “expert” links, and spending '100 seconds on each page were learning analytic measures and were positively correlated with Case MCQ success; rushing through pages ('20 seconds) was inversely correlated with success. Conversely, for some measures, we failed to find expected associations. Conclusions: In online learning environments, the wealth of process data available offers insights for instructional designers to iteratively hone the effectiveness of learning. Learning analytic measures of engagement can provide feedback as to which interaction elements are effective. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084859070"

For example, by focusing on summative, tiered clerkship grades, students often discount accompanying feedback that could inform future learning. This case report seeks to explore whether an assessment system intervention which eliminated tiered grades and enhanced feedback was associated with changes in student perceptions of clerkship assessment and perceptions of the clinical learning environment. Intervention: In January 2019, our institution eliminated tiered clerkship grading (honors/pass/fail) for medical students during the core clerkship year and implemented pass/fail clerkship grading along with required twice weekly, work-based assessments for formative feedback. Context: In this single institution, cross-sectional survey study, we collected data from fourth-year medical students one year after an assessment system intervention. The intervention entailed changing from honors/pass/fail to pass/fail grading in all eight core clerkships and implementing an electronic system to record twice-weekly real-time formative work-based assessments. The survey queried student perceptions on the fairness and accuracy of grading and the clinical learning environment—including whether clerkships were mastery- or performance-oriented. We compared responses from students one year after the assessment intervention to those from the class one year before the intervention. Comparisons were made using unpaired, two-tailed t-tests or chi-squared tests as appropriate with Cohen’s d for effect size estimation for score differences. Content analysis was used to analyze responses from two open-ended questions about feedback and grading. Impact: Survey response rates were similar before and after intervention (76% (127/168) vs. 72% (118/163), respectively) with no between-group differences in demographics. The after-intervention group showed statistically significant increases in the following factors: “grades are transparent and fair” (Cohen’s d = 0.80), “students receive useful feedback” (d = 0.51), and “resident evaluation procedures are fair” (d = 0.40). After-intervention respondents perceived the clerkship learning environment to be more mastery-oriented (d = 0.52), less performance approach-oriented (d = 0.63), and less performance avoid-oriented (d = 0.49). There were no statistical differences in the factors “attending evaluation procedures are fair,” “evaluations are accurate,” “evaluations are biased,” or “perception of stereotype threat.” Open-ended questions revealed student recommendations to improve clerkship summary narratives, burden of work-based assessment, and in-person feedback. Lessons Learned: After an assessment system change to pass/fail grading with work-based assessments, we observed moderate to large improvements in student perceptions of clerkship grading and the mastery orientation of the learning environment. Our intervention did not improve perceptions around bias in assessment in clerkships. Other medical schools may consider similar interventions to begin to address student concerns with clerkship assessment and promote a more adaptive learning environment. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106345501"

Background: The question of who should assess participants during objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) has been debated, and options discussed in the literature have included peer, self, standardized patient, and faculty assessment models. What is not known is whether same-level peer assisted learning can be utilized for formative assessment of advanced communication skills when no faculty, standardized patients, or other trained assessors are involved in providing feedback. If successful, such an educational model would optimize resource utilization and broaden the scope of topics that could be covered in formative OSCEs. Approach: The investigators developed a 4-station formative OSCE focused on advanced communication skills for senior medical students, and evaluated the concordance of assessment done by same-level peers, self, standardized patients, and faculty for 45 students. After each station, examinees completed a self-assessment checklist and received checklist-based assessment and verbal feedback from same-level peers only. Standardized patients completed checklist-based assessments outside the room, and faculty did so after the OSCE via video review; neither group provided direct feedback to examinees. The investigators assessed inter-rater agreement and mean difference scores on the checklists using faculty score as the gold standard. Findings: There was fair to good overall agreement among self, same-level peer, standardized patient, and faculty-assessment of advanced communication skills. Relative to faculty, peer and standardized patient assessors overestimated advanced communication skills, while self-assessments underestimated skills. Conclusions: Self and same-level peer-assessment may be a viable alternative to faculty assessment for a formative OSCE on advanced communication skills for senior medical students. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081411316"

Health systems science competencies, such as high-value care, population health, and systems thinking, are increasingly being integrated into curricula, but not without challenges. One challenge is mixed receptivity by students, the underlying reasons of which have not been extensively explored. In this qualitative study, we explored the research question: “How do students perceive health systems science curricula across all four years, and how do such perceptions inform the reasons for mixed quality ratings?” Approach: Following large-scale health systems science curricular changes in their medical school, we used students’ open-ended comments obtained from course evaluations related to 1st-, 2nd-, and 4th-year courses and performed a qualitative thematic analysis to explore students’ perceptions. We identified themes, synthesized findings into a conceptual figure, and agreed upon results and quotations. Findings: Five themes were identified: (1) perceived importance and relevance of health systems science education, (2) tension between traditional and evolving health systems science-related professional identity, (3) dissatisfaction with redundancy of topics, (4) competition with basic and clinical science curricula, and, (5) preference for discrete, usable, testable facts over complexity and uncertainty. The relationship between themes is described along a continuum of competing agendas between students’ traditional mindset (which focuses on basic/clinical science) and an emerging medical education approach (which focuses on basic, clinical, and health systems science). Insights: Health systems science education can be viewed by learners as peripheral to their future practice and not aligned with a professional identity that places emphasis on basic and clinical science topics. For some students, this traditional identity limits engagement in health systems science curricula. If health systems science is to achieve its full potential in medical education, further work is required to explore the adoption of new perspectives by students and create activities to accelerate the process. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077382686"

Background: Medical practitioners’ reflective skills are increasingly considered important and therefore included in the medical education curriculum. However, assessing students’ reflective skills using rubrics does not appear to guarantee adequate inter-rater reliabilities. Recently, comparative judgment was introduced as a new method to evaluate performance assessments. This study investigates the merits and limitations of the comparative judgment method for assessing students’ written self-reflections. More specifically, it examines the reliability in relation to the time spent assessing, the correlation between the scores obtained using the two methods (rubrics and comparative judgment), and, raters’ perceptions of the comparative judgment method. Approach: Twenty-two self-reflections, that had previously been scored using a rubric, were assessed by a group of eight raters using comparative judgment. Two hundred comparisons were completed and a rank order was calculated. Raters’ impressions were investigated using a focus group. Findings: Using comparative judgment, each self-reflection needed to be compared seven times with another self-reflection to reach a scale separation reliability of.55. The inter-rater reliability of rating (ICC, (1, k)) using rubrics was.56. The time investment required for these reliability levels in both methods was around 24 minutes. The Kendall’s tau rank correlation indicated a strong correlation between the scores obtained via both methods. Raters reported that making comparisons made them evaluate the quality of self-reflections in a more nuanced way. Time investment was, however, considered heavy, especially for the first comparisons. Although raters appreciated that they did not have to assign a grade to each self-reflection, the fact that the method does not automatically lead to a grade or feedback was considered a downside. Conclusions: First evidence was provided for the comparative judgment method as an alternative to using rubrics for assessing students’ written self-reflections. Before comparative judgment can be implemented for summative assessment, more research is needed on the time investment required to ensure no contradictory feedback is given back to students. Moreover, as the comparative judgment method requires an additional standard setting exercise to obtain grades, more research is warranted on the merits and limitations of this method when a pass/fail approach is used. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101484391"

The influence of clinical experience on knowledge and attitudes has not been examined. The study purpose was to examine physicians’ and advanced practice providers’ (a) self-perceived knowledge and attitudes about LGBTQ + health topics, (b) the relationship between clinical experience and self-perceived knowledge and attitudes, and (c) preferences for LGBTQ + medical education. Approach: An online anonymous survey was emailed to 3667 physicians and advanced practice providers at a large southeastern multisite healthcare institution. Logistic regression determined associations between clinical experience, knowledge, and attitudes. Findings: There were 880 (24.0%) respondents. Most were physicians (70%). Thirty-eight percent had more than 15 years of experience. Fifty-four percent preferred online education. Few reported sophisticated knowledge of six LGBTQ + health topics (6%–10%). The majority felt that these were either important or very important for all physicians. After accounting for demographics, experience was not associated with knowledge or attitudes. Insights: Knowledge gaps yet positive attitudes suggest that additional training on LGBTQ + patients is warranted and likely to be well received. The lack of influence of experience on knowledge and attitudes may suggest that training is applicable to clinicians of all experience levels. Future research should determine if knowledge and attitudes toward LGBTQ + health topics influence culturally competent healthcare practices. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097630741"

In recent years, a large number of international students have begun to study medicine in China. Due to the privacy and intimacy associated with obstetrical and gynecological diseases, Chinese women’s acceptance toward international students’ involvement in their care has not been reported thus far. This survey aims (1) to determine Chinese women’s attitudes toward both Chinese and international medical student involvements in obstetrical and gynecological outpatient departments and (2) to investigate possible reasons, if any, for their rejection of the medical students. Approach: We conducted a cross-sectional survey study using a locally-developed questionnaire. The survey was conducted in the obstetrical and gynecological outpatient department of a tertiary hospital in a Chinese harbor city. We surveyed 600 patients for their attitudes towards the involvement of four groups of medical student in clinical practice: Chinese female, International female, Chinese male, and International male. Among the returned questionnaires, 501 satisfied the criteria for analysis. Findings: Patient’s acceptance rates of the four groups of students (Chinese female, International female, Chinese male, and International male) were 59.7%, 55.9%, 32.1%, and 25.9%, respectively. Analysis revealed that language barriers and lack of friendliness were the two main reasons leading to patients’ low acceptance rates of international students. Insights: Obstetrical and gynecological patients are more likely to accept female students over male students, regardless of their nationality, however International male students receive the least acceptance. For international students, improving their Chinese language skills and using more friendly expressions may facilitate their practice in China. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

However, for the purpose of this paper, clinical reasoning is defined as the cognitive processes that are involved in the steps of information gathering, problem representation, generating a differential diagnosis, providing a diagnostic justification to arrive at a leading diagnosis, and formulating diagnostic and management plans. Background: Expert performance in clinical reasoning is essential for success as a physician, and has been difficult for clerkship directors to observe and quantify in a way that fosters the instruction and assessment of clinical reasoning. The purpose of this study was to gather validity evidence for the Multistep exam (MSX) format used by our medicine clerkship to assess analytical clinical reasoning abilities; we did this by examining the relationship between scores on the MSX and other external measures of clinical reasoning abilities. This analysis used dual process theory as the main theoretical framework of clinical reasoning, as well as aspects of Kane’s validity framework to guide the selection of validity evidence for the investigation. We hypothesized that there would be an association between the MSX (a three-step clinical reasoning tool developed locally), and the USMLE Step 2 CS, as they share similar concepts in assessing the clinical reasoning of students. We examined the relationship between overall scores on the MSX and the Step 2 CS Integrated Clinical Encounter (ICE) score, in which the student articulates their reasoning for simulated patient cases, while controlling for examinee’s internal medicine clerkship performance measures such as the NBME subject exam score and the Medicine clerkship OSCE score. Approach: A total 477 of 487 (97.9%) medical students, representing the graduating classes of 2015, 2016, 2017, who took the MSX at the end of each medicine clerkship (2012–2016), and Step 2 CS (2013–2017) were included in this study. Correlation analysis and multiple linear regression analysis were used to examine the impact of the primary explanatory variables of interest (MSX) onto the outcome variable (ICE score) when controlling for baseline variables (Medicine OSCE and NBME Medicine subject exam). Findings: The overall MSX score had a significant, positive correlation with the Step 2 CS ICE score (r =.26, P <.01). The overall MSX score was a significant predictor of Step 2 CS ICE score (ß =.19, P <.001), explaining an additional 4% of the variance of ICE beyond the NBME Medicine subject score and the Medicine OSCE score (Adjusted R2 = 13%). Conclusion: The stepwise format of the MSX provides a tool to observe clinical reasoning performance, which can be used in an assessment system to provide feedback to students on their analytical clinical reasoning. Future studies should focus on gaining additional validity evidence across different learners and multiple medical schools. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083884061"

This pivot tends to happen in the clerkship year, when students are immersed in the clinical environment, gaining a practical understanding of the day-to-day work in different fields. Yet, in this year students have limited experiences with specialties. Clinical electives during the clerkship year may aid students in career development. The authors examined student career exploration through the lens of social cognitive career theory (SCCT). SCCT posits three variables that influence career development: personal goals, self-efficacy, and understanding outcome expectations. With this framework, the authors sought to understand how a program of clinical electives during the clerkship year influences students’ perceptions of their career exploration. We aimed to: (1) describe an innovative clerkship elective program designed for career exploration, and (2) explore how this influenced students’ career exploration using qualitative analysis. Intervention: Beginning in 2018, students at our institution were required to participate in three 2-week clinical electives during their clerkship year, called Clinical Immersive Experiences (CIExes). CIExes were categorized into four different types: apprenticeship, clinical skills building, integrative (multi-disciplinary), or subspecialty. Authors invited fourth year students to participate in interviews (January to March 2019) about how they selected electives and how these electives contributed to their career exploration. Interviews continued until reaching information sufficiency. Authors coded and analyzed transcripts using template analysis. Context: This curricular intervention took place in the context of large-scale curricular redesign. Students began clerkships partway into their second year of medical school. The family and community medicine clerkship, which was previously a 6-week core clerkship, was changed to a longitudinal format, thus freeing up 6 weeks for electives. Other core clerkships included anesthesia (2 weeks), medicine (8 weeks), neurology (4 weeks), obstetrics and gynecology (6 weeks), pediatrics (6 weeks), psychiatry (4 weeks), and surgery (8 weeks). Impact: From 15 student interviews, we identified three major themes. First, CIExes facilitated personalized career exploration. All students felt that at least one elective helped them solidify their decision about a specialty choice. Second, CIExes promoted focused learning and skills development that complemented core rotations. They noted the benefit of positive relationships with supervisors, particularly attendings, during these electives. Third, students highlighted how these electives fostered a positive learning environment and enhanced wellbeing. SCCT clarified how the CIEx program helped students advance their personal goals, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations during a pivotal time in medical school. Lessons Learned: We learned that from the student perspective, the inclusion of clinical electives in the clerkship year benefited students’ career exploration by helping them develop and refine their career goals, increase self-efficacy, and test outcome expectations in a meaningful way as anticipated from SCCT. In addition, we found that CIExes created a positive learning environment that allowed deep relationships to develop in fields of interest and that supported a strong sense of wellbeing.

Patient communication skills in English are indispensable for healthcare professionals in non-English-speaking countries. This is not only in caring for foreign patients within the country but also contributing to the global health by practicing outside of the country. Although Japanese-speaking simulated patients have been involved in medical education in Japan since the 1970s and with Objective Structured Clinical Examinations formally implemented in 2005, very few medical schools have been working with English-speaking simulated patients (ESSPs). Approach: A nationwide survey was conducted to investigate the involvement of ESSPs at medical schools in Japan. A questionnaire with closed and open-ended questions was mailed to the deans of 80 medical schools to determine the current ESSP involvement and the problems educators were facing in regard to working with or not working with ESSPs. The survey was conducted from November 2015 through March 2016. Data were analyzed to find problems regarding ESSPs so that their involvement could be enhanced toward developing medical students’ patient communication skills. Findings: Responses from 60 medical schools (75% response rate) were received and analyzed. Among them, 22 schools were working with ESSPs, and 23 schools were willing to introduce them into their programs. The background of ESSPs varied with international students or faculty often filling the role. Many ESSPs received less than two hours of training. ESSP programs were required in the preclinical years, and more often elective in the clinical years. Medical schools mentioned the difficulty of recruiting and training ESSPs and finding the funding to pay for their remuneration and travel expenses. Insights: ESSPs were increasingly used in Japanese medical schools but they were haphazardly recruited from within the school or from the local community, not trained fully, and inconsistent performers. Nevertheless, an encounter with a non-Japanese English-speaking simulated patient was regarded effective in developing medical students’ patient communication skills in English (language skills and cultural sensitivity). Ways must be found to assure the availability, quality, and sustainability of trained ESSPs so that more authentic practices and high-stakes skills exams can be introduced to ensure patient safety in the globalized world. As countries become more multicultural and international migration of healthcare professionals expands, ESSPs can be a valuable source for training and assessing international medical students and trainees’ English-language patient interviewing skills. Regional hubs of ESSPs and the use of telehealth in collaboration with educators around the world could enhance the use of ESSPs worldwide. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107375784"

This allowed for a discussion, for the first time, about how doctors should talk to patients, and manage interviews with them. However, there was a focus on a set of behavioral processes which were often unsophisticated with respect to the role of language in communication, or of language as a means of sustaining and describing ambiguity, or language as the primary impetus for educational reflection. Evidence: This paper looks at literature from language studies, the philosophy of language and the philosophy of education to establish the point that, where natural languages are concerned, it is possible and useful to talk of the purposes for which language is used. It is also important to recognize that the meaning of a particular language use is to a substantial extent defined by context: and that languages are excellent vehicles for maintaining and describing ambiguity, where it is impossible to reduce a state of affairs to the well-defined conclusion of empirical research. Implications: In the light of this understanding, there is a need for “communication,” and particularly the methodologies through which it is taught, to reflect these points. Simulation exercises, designed to develop clinical communication, should be clear that there is no single correct way of “talking to patients,” no set of behavioral processes which is always effective. It is, in the end, the awareness and wisdom of the doctor, selecting from among a range of available approaches, which is at stake. In addition, methodologies should account for the recognition that awareness comes only from reflection, and that helping medical students and doctors alike to reflect is central to good practice. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100826923"

This study explores supervisors’ perceptions of how they currently learn evidence-based medicine by engaging in learning conversations with their trainee. Approach: Semi-structured, video-stimulated elicitation interviews were held with twenty-two Dutch and Belgian supervisors in general practice. Supervisors were shown fragments of their video-recorded learning conversations, allowing them to reflect. Recorded interviews were analyzed using a grounded theory-based approach.Findings: Supervisors did not immediately perceive workplace learning conversations as an opportunity to learn evidence-based medicine from their trainee. They mostly saw these conversations as a learning opportunity for trainees and a chance to maintain the quality of care within their practice. Nevertheless, during the interviews, supervisors did acknowledge that learning conversations help them to gain up-to-date knowledge and search skills or more awareness of their own knowledge or gaps in their knowledge. Not identified as a learning outcome was how to apply evidence-based medicine within a clinical practice by combining evidence with clinical expertise and the patient’s preferences. Insights: Supervisors acknowledge that they learn elements of the three aspects of evidence-based medicine by having learning conversations with their trainee, but they currently see this as secondary to the trainee’s learning process. Emphasizing opportunities for bidirectional learning could improve learning of evidence-based medicine during workplace learning conversations. © 2020 The Author(s).

With an increase in the demand for healthcare and rising costs related to chronic care, physicians need to be better trained to address chronic disease at various stages of illness in a collaborative and cost-effective manner. Specific and measurable learning objectives are key to the design and evaluation of effective training, but there has been no consensus on chronic disease learning objectives appropriate to medical student education. Approach: Wagner’s Chronic Care Model (CCM) was selected as a theoretical framework to guide development of an enhanced chronic disease prevention and management (CDPM) curriculum. Findings of a literature review of CDPM competencies, objectives, and topical statements were mapped to each of the six domains of the CCM to understand the breadth of existing learning topics within each domain. At an in-person meeting, medical educators prepared a survey for the modified Delphi approach. Attendees identified 51 possible learning objectives from the literature review mapping, rephrased the CCM domains as competencies, constructed possible CDPM learning objectives for each competency with the goal of reaching multi-institutional consensus on a limited number of CDPM learning objectives that would be feasible for institutions to use to guide enhancement of medical student curricula related to CDPM. After the meeting, the group developed a survey which included 39 learning objectives. In the study phase of the modified Delphi approach, 32 physician CDPM experts and educators completed an online survey to prioritize the top 20 objectives. The next step occurred at a CDPM interest group in-person meeting with the goal of identifying the top 10 objectives. Findings: The CCM domains were reframed as the following competencies for medical student education: patient self-care management, decision support, clinical information systems, community resources, delivery systems and teams, and health system practice and improvement. Eleven CDPM learning objectives were identified within the six competencies that were most important in developing curriculum for medical students. Insights: These learning objectives cut across education on the prevention and management of individual chronic diseases and frame chronic disease care as requiring the health system science competencies identified in the CCM. They are intended to be used in combination with traditional disease-specific pathophysiology and treatment objectives. Additional efforts are needed to identify specific curricular strategies and assessment tools for each learning objective. © 2020, © 2020 American Medical Association.

Landscapes of practice and its concepts of knowledgeability and identification are suggested as a framework that may help optimize IPE. This Observation paper provides an explanation of how these concepts might be used in IPE-design. Evidence: We propose using three modes of identification, i.e., engagement, imagination, and alignment, described in this framework, for an IPE-design that fosters IPC skills, professional identity formation, and knowledgeability about a field and its actors. Identification and knowledgeability are through to enable successful collaboration across professional and practice boundaries. Implications: Focusing on identification implies that students develop a sense of relevance to one another in solving complex problems (engagement), they become aware of their own roles and responsibilities in relation to others (imagination), and they gain awareness of the context in which the different professions align and collaborate (alignment). Altogether, this enables students to become knowledgeable in the landscape, which prepares them for successful interprofessional collaboration in practice. © 2021 The Author(s).

Two primary reasons for moving Step 1 after the core clerkships are to promote deeper, more integrated basic science learning in clinical contexts and to better prepare students for the increasingly clinical focus of Step 1. Positioning Step 1 after the core clerkships leverages a major national assessment to drive learning, encouraging students to deepen their basic science knowledge while in the clinical setting. Previous studies demonstrated small increases in Step 1 scores, reductions in failure rates, and similar Step 2 Clinical Knowledge scores when Step 1 was after the clerkships. Some schools that have moved Step 1 reported declines in clinical subject examination (CSE) performance. This may be due to shortened pre-clerkship curricula, the absence of the Step 1 study period for knowledge consolidation, or exposure to fewer National Board of Medical Examiners type questions prior to taking CSEs. This multi-institutional study aimed to determine whether student performance on CSEs was affected by moving Step 1 after the core clerkships. Approach: CSE scores for students from eight schools that moved Step 1 after core clerkships between 2012 and 2016 were analyzed in a pre-post format. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to quantify the effect of the curriculum on CSE performance. Additional analysis determined if clerkship order impacted clinical subject exam performance and whether the curriculum change resulted in more students scoring in the lowest percentiles (as defined as below the national fifth percentile) before and after the curricular change. Findings: After moving Step 1 to after the clerkships, collectively these eight schools demonstrated statistically significant lower performance on four CSEs (Medicine, Neurology, Pediatrics, and Surgery) but not Obstetrics/Gynecology or Psychiatry. Comparing performance within the three years pre and post Step 1 change, differences across all clerkships ranged from 0.3 to −2.0 points, with an average difference of −1.1. CSE performance in clerkships taken early in the sequence was more affected by the curricular change, and differences gradually disappeared with subsequent examinations. Medicine and Neurology showed the largest average differences between curricular-group when taken early in the clinical year. Finally, there was a slightly higher chance of scoring below the national fifth percentile in four of the clinical subject exams (Medicine, Neurology, Pediatrics, and Psychiatry) for the cohort with Step 1 after the clerkships. Insights: Moving Step 1 after core clerkships had a small impact on CSE scores overall, with decreased scores for exams early in the clerkship sequence and an increased number of students below the fifth percentile. Score differences have minor effects on clerkship grades, but overall the size of the effect is unlikely to be educationally meaningful. Schools can use a variety of mitigation strategies to address CSE performance and Step 1 preparation in the clerkship phase. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098495852"

Despite producing thousands of international medical graduates per year, Pakistani medical education is still in its infancy. The application of Western medical education methods and theories is beset by unique socio-cultural challenges. These must be identified and addressed to ease our physicians’ transition from clinician to teacher and maximize their teaching output in a resource-limited setting. Approach: Eight clinical teachers were interviewed from Combined Military Hospital Kharian, Punjab, Pakistan in July 2020. Semi-structured questionnaires were used, and interviews were audio-taped to generate transcripts. These were analyzed qualitatively and coded, developing themes regarding barriers to identity formation. Findings: Six themes reflected possible barriers to identity formation and fell under two domains: individual and systemic issues. At the individual level these themes were: conflicting priorities, lack of autonomy, and language barriers. Systemic issues were found to be: disconnect between educationists and teachers, the absence of incentives, and lack of institutional support. Insight: Identifying barriers to identity formation can aid clinical teachers’ development and encourage discourse around providing increased institutional support to teachers to overcome said barriers. Both the individual and the institute are stakeholders in the process of identity formation and dialogue between the two can lead to improved teaching outcomes. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103572590"

While this agreement is assumed to include all patients, historical examples of medical experimentation and mistreatment suggest that medicine’s social contract has not been extended to Black patients. We suggest that is because underlying medicine’s contract with society is another contract; the racial contract, which favors white individuals and legitimizes the mistreatment of those who are nonwhite. When Black/African American physicians enter medicine, they enter into the social contract as an agreement with society, but must navigate the realities of the racial contract in ways that have yet to be acknowledged. This study examines how Black/African American physicians interpret and enact the social contract in light of the country’s racial contract by investigating the ways in which Black/African American physicians discuss their interactions with Black patients. Approach: This qualitative study reexamines cross-sectional data previously collected in 2018-2019 examining the professional identity formation (PIF) experiences of Black/African American trainees and physicians in the Southern part of the U.S. The goal of the larger study was to explore participants’ professional identity formation experiences as racialized individuals within a predominantly white profession. The current study examines these data in light of medicine’s social contract with society and Mill’s (1997) theory of the racial contract to understand how Black physicians interpret and enact the social contract. Participants included 10 Black/African American students, eight residents, and nine attending physicians. Findings: The findings show that Black/African American physicians and trainees are aware of the country’s racial contract, which has resulted in Black patients being historically excluded from what has been described in the social contract that governs all physicians. As such, they are actively working to extend the social contract so that it includes Black patients and their communities. Specifically, they engage in trust building with the Black community to make sure all patients are included. Building trust includes ensuring a consistent stream of new Black/African American trainees, and equipping Black trainees and patients with the skills needed to improve the healthcare within the Black/African American community. Insights: While it been has assumed that all patients are included in the social contract between medicine and society, historical examples of medical mistreatment and experimentation demonstrate this is inaccurate; Black/African American communities have not been included. In an effort to dismantle systemic racism in the U.S., medical education must teach about its racist past and divulge how some communities have been historically excluded, providing new ways to think about how to include everyone in medicine’s social contract. © 2021 The Author(s).

CCC training in East Asian contexts has been constrained by the fact that “cultural diversity” training globally has focused primarily on the needs of racial and ethnic communities, to the relative neglect of other groups. The present study explores Taiwanese students’ perceptions of CCC provision to identify gaps in local medical education and thus facilitate a more systematic delivery of CCC. Approach: Using an adapted and translated version of the Cross-Cultural Care Survey developed by Harvard Medical School, we collected 1567 student responses from four geographically-distributed Taiwanese medical schools between 2015 and 2017. In addition to student responses, we also collected 122 clinical teacher responses from two of the four medical schools that were surveyed to cross-examine the students’ self-perceived competence. The data were analyzed with SPSS and ANOVA was employed with student data to compare the differences among different stages. The analysis focuses on CCC in 4 stages of training: general education, basic pre-clinical and integrated clinical sciences, clerkship, and internship. Findings: The findings show that students felt unprepared to deal with health disparities and the needs of diverse groups and there was no evidence of an increased sense of preparedness in the development of relevant skills in the analyses of the pre-clinical to clinical stages of the curriculum. Similarly, teachers also perceived students across the different stages of training to be unprepared in dealing with the health disparities and needs of diverse groups. However, although findings from teachers’ responses parallel those from students, teachers tend to perceive students to be even more unprepared than they perceive themselves to be. The training for CCC appeared inadequate from both set of data and students perceive CCC training to be less explicitly evident in the medical program as it advances from the foundation stage to the pre-clinical stage. Insights: The study raises some crucial issues in terms of diversity and CCC training in medical education programs. The fact that increased awareness of health disparities and the needs of diverse groups fails to be aligned with a sense of preparedness and skillfulness confirms that CCC has not been explicitly and sufficiently addressed in the medical curriculum, particularly in the pre-clinical stage when the focus is on acquiring scientific and technical knowledge. This study shows how a questionnaire designed by and for an American medical institution situated in a highly diverse society can be adapted so that its findings serve as a baseline for medical education programs in Taiwan, and perhaps in other countries that are beginning to acknowledge hitherto “hidden” diversity. This study also has implications which indicate that CCC is crucial in the delivery of appropriate care by members of the medical profession to diverse patients. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096091033"

Hypothesis: Using clinical simulation, this study aimed to explore the relationship between patient care ownership and the cognitive processes involved in the creation of a professional identity. Methods: In 2018–2019, 189 third-year students participated in a simulation in which they were placed in the role of a physician treating a patient in respiratory distress. Data were collected from 12 focus groups (n = 84; 44% of the third-year class), each lasting 15–25 minute. Students were asked four questions designed to identify moments when they felt like a physician and experienced feelings of ownership. Each focus group was transcribed and analyzed for the presence of known elements that contribute to feelings of psychological ownership, and then inductively for how students related their feelings of ownership to their professional identity. Results: When students were asked to take ownership of their patient’s care, they underwent a three-step process: (1) experiencing disorientation, (2) reconceptualizing roles and responsibilities, and (3) reorientation to professional goals. Patient care ownership was disorienting because it marked a departure from the clinical roles the students had previously experienced. While disoriented, students engaged in a process of reflection during which they asked themselves who they were, who they were becoming, and who they needed to become to effectively serve in the role of a physician. This process prompted students to realize the limitations of their clinical reasoning abilities and that the role of a physician requires new ways of thinking. Conclusions: This study advances a conceptual model of PIF that identifies patient care ownership as a catalyst in developing a professional identity. Assuming responsibility for patients places students into an unfamiliar role, which opens a channel for students to access new perspectives in their development as physicians. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092308045"

Empathy is a desired trait for medical students that has been correlated with reduced burnout. The concept of guilt is closely related to concern about the well-being of others; therefore, feelings of guilt may be associated with empathy. Excessive guilt poses an increased risk for internalized distress, symptoms such as anhedonia, and may be related to burnout. The relationship between pathogenic guilt and burnout in medical students is unknown. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that pathogenic guilt is present and related to both burnout and empathy in medical students. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey study of all students in one medical school. Data were collected in February 2020. The Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OBLI), Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ), and Interpersonal Guilt Questionaire-67 (IGQ-67) were used. A modified version of IGQ-67 was used to measure four subscales of pathogenic guilt: survival guilt, separation guilt, omnipotence guilt, and self-hate guilt. Data analyses for this study including screening, evaluation of assumptions, descriptive statistics, reliabilities, one-way ANOVA, and correlation coefficients, were conducted using SPSS version 26. Results: Of 300, 168 (56.0%) students participated in the study. Survival, omnipotence, and self-hate classes of pathogenic guilt were positively correlated with burnout. Empathy was correlated with two classes of pathogenic guilt: survival and omnipotence. Empathy was inversely related to burnout (disengagement). Conclusions: Pathogenic guilt may be a contributor to burnout in medical students. Guilt should be a target of prevention and treatment in burnout in medical students.

During the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, New York Medical College School of Medicine students witnessed the attacks and then became members of emergency treatment teams at St. Vincent’s Hospital, the trauma center nearest to the World Trade Center. To date, only two reports describe how 9/11 influenced the lives of medical students. This study was designed to characterize the short- and long-term effects on NYMC students and to compare those effects between students assigned to St Vincent’s Hospital and classmates assigned to rotations at facilities more remote from the attack site. We hypothesized that participation in direct relief efforts by students assigned to the St. Vincent’s site might have long-lasting effects on their lives and these effects might vary when compared to classmates assigned elsewhere. Approach: This was a retrospective, survey-based, unmatched cohort study. Participants included all school of medicine graduates who were St. Vincent’s rotators on 9/11 (N = 22) and classmates (N = 24) assigned to other sites who could be contacted and agreed to participate. Our primary measure was whether the 9/11 experience affected the participant’s life, defined as an affirmative response to the item which asked whether the 9/11 experience affected the participant’s “life thereafter, career choice, attitudes toward life or attitudes toward practice.” Secondary measures included self-reported effects on career, life, attitudes, health, resilience, personal growth, personality features, and the temporal relationship between the attack and stress symptoms. Findings: Completed surveys were received from 16/22 (73%) St. Vincent’s and 18/24 (75%) non-Saint Vincent’s participants: 62% male, 82% had children, 74% identified as Caucasian/white and 76% employed full-time. Overall, slightly more than half (58%) of respondents reported an effect of 9/11 on their life, with a greater but non-significant proportion of St. Vincent’s rotators reporting life impact (67% versus 50% for St. Vincent’s versus other locations, respectively). High post-9/11 stress levels, current marriage, and ability to make and keep family and social relationships were associated with an effect on life which approached statistical significance. Participants reported positive or no post 9/11 effects on empathy and altruism (50%), resilience (47%), attitudes toward medical practice and career (32%), and charitable giving (24%), while positive, negative, or no effects were reported for attitude toward life, family and social relations, physical health, and conscientiousness. Mental health was the only domain in which all participants reported unchanged or negative effects. Two St. Vincent’s rotators but no students assigned elsewhere believed they experienced 9/11-related post-traumatic stress disorder. Insights: Just over half of New York Medical College School of Medicine students rotating at St. Vincent’s Hospital on 9/11 or elsewhere reported significant life-effects as a result of direct/indirect experiences related to the attack. Perceived stress may have been a more important driver of this life-change than other factors such as geographic proximity to the disaster site and/or direct participation in relief efforts. Further study of medical school interventions focused on stress reduction among students who participate in disaster relief is warranted. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092788069"

These rapidly growing populations face significant health disparities, which is likely in part due to the lack of culturally competent physicians trained to treat these populations. While the Institute of Medicine calls for cross-cultural training for all providers, it is not clear if this need is being met. The purpose of this study is to examine medical trainees’ current level of cultural training and whether this corresponds to confidence in caring for Arab and Muslim patients. Approach: The authors created an anonymous survey that was distributed via email to medical students and residents at Michigan Medicine between January and March 2020. Questions included trainees’ comfort and confidence level in caring for Arab and Muslim patients, as well education received on this topic. Findings: Results showed that 41% of respondents were confident in their ability to take a history from an Arab patient immigrated to the U.S. Additionally, 55% of non-Muslim participants reported that they felt comfortable in caring for fasting patients, while only 24% felt confident in their ability to answer patient questions about fasting. Approximately half of respondents felt confident in their ability to examine an Arabic-speaking woman (47%) or woman wearing a hijab (49%). The majority of respondents had not received any training or education in the care of Arab patients (64%) or fasting patients (81%). Insight: Medical trainees at one large academic medical center in the state with the second largest Arab-American population, and one of the largest populations of Muslim-Americans lack comfort and confidence in providing culturally competent care for Arab and Muslim patients. Education of trainees about Arab and Muslim health should be implemented into the curriculum to optimize care delivered to this patient population. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107674129"

Background: In the age of CBME, qualitative comments play an important role in clarifying the quantitative scores rendered by observers at the bedside. Currently there are few practical tools that evaluate mixed data (e.g. associated score-and-comment data), other than the comprehensive Completed Clinical Evaluation Report Rating tool (CCERR) that was originally derived to rate end-of-rotation reports. Approach: A multi-center, randomized cohort-based rating exercise was conducted to evaluate the rating properties of the QuAL score as compared to the CCERR. One group rated comments using the QuAL score, and the other group rated comments using the CCERR. A generalizability study (G-Study) and a decision study (D-study) were conducted to determine the number of meta-raters for a reliable rating (phi-coefficient target of >0.80). Both scores were correlated against rater’s gestalt perceptions of utility for both faculty and residents reading the scores. Results: Twenty-five meta-raters from 20 sites participated in this rating exercise. The G-study revealed that the CCERR group (n = 13) rated the comments with a very high reliability (Phi = 0.97). Meanwhile, the QuAL group (n = 12) rated the comments with a similarly high reliability (Phi = 0.97). The QuAL score required only two raters to reach an acceptable target reliability of >0.80, while the CCERR required three. The QuAL score correlated with perceptions of utility (Meta-rater usefulness, Pearson’s r = 0.69, p < 0.001; Perceived usefulness for trainee, r = 0.74, p < 0.001). The CCERR performed similarly, correlating with perceived faculty (r = 0.67, <0.001) and resident utility (0.79, <0.001). Conclusions: The QuAL score is reliable rating score that correlates well with perceptions of utility. The QuAL score may be useful for rating shorter comments generated by workplace-based assessments. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078940368"

To manage the burden of injury from gun violence and identify primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention strategies, physician leaders must understand the biological and psychosocial aspects of this complex problem. However, gun violence and its complexities are not widely taught in medical schools. This Observation article details why gun violence education is not being included in medical education, offers an informed, science-based model for the disease of gun violence, and suggests methods to integrate gun violence education into medical school curricula. Evidence: We surveyed the literature for articles addressing this topic and for studies on medical school education and curriculum changes. We also examined some of the resources commonly used in medical school for mention of gun violence. Finally, we conducted a query of the AAMC Curriculum Inventory to further see if gun violence is currently incorporated into participating U.S. medical schools’ curricula and found that gun violence is not a topic discussed in any significant capacity at most U.S. medical schools. Only 13–18% of schools that participated in the AAMC Curriculum Inventory during the years 2015–2018 documented gun and firearm content in their curriculum. Any other disease with similar number of deaths and injuries would be considered worthy of inclusion into medical education curricula. Implications: Medical school curricula commonly adjust with the ebb and flow of disease. Although gun violence meets the classic definition of a disease and is a major cause of harm and death, it is not taught to medical students. We assert that gun violence should be taught and framed as a biopsychosocial disease, highlighting many opportunities for interventions across a team of health care providers and physician leaders. We strongly urge medical schools to evaluate their curricula, address this teaching gap, and train the next generation of physician leaders to address all aspects of gun violence. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104939062"

The task of medical education research is seen as establishing which educational interventions produce the desired learning outcomes. This ‘medical model’ of education does not do justice to the dynamics of education as an open, semiotic, recursive system rather than a closed, causal system. Evidence: Empirical ‘evidence’ of ‘what works’–that is, what is supposed to affect ‘learning’–has become the norm for medical educational improvements, where generalized summary outcomes of research are often presented as must-follow guidelines for myriad future educational situations. Such investigations of educational processes tend to lack an explicit engagement with the purposes of medical education, which we suggest to understand in terms of qualification (the acquisition of knowledge, skills, and understanding), socialization (becoming a member of the professional group) and subjectification (becoming a thoughtful, independent, responsible professional). In addition, investigations of educational processes tend to rely on causal assumptions that are inadequate for capturing the dynamics of educational communication and interaction. Although we see an increasing acknowledgement of the context-dependency of teaching practices toward educational aims, the currently prevailing view in medical education and educational research limits understanding of what is actually going on when educators teach and students participate in medical education–a situation which seriously hinders advancements in the field. Implications: In this paper, we hope to inform discussion about the practice of medical education by proposing to view medical education in terms of three domains of purpose (professional qualification, professional socialization, and professional subjectification) and with full acknowledgement of the dynamics of educational interaction and communication. Such a view implies that curriculum design, pedagogy, assessment, and evaluation should be reoriented to include and integrate all three purposes in educational practice. It also means that medical education research findings cannot be applied in just any teaching context without carefully considering the value of the suggested courses of actions toward the particular educational aims and teaching setting. In addition, medical educational research would need to investigate all three purposes and recognize the openness, semiotic nature, and recursivity of education in offering implications for teaching practice. © 2020 The Author(s).

Milestones should enable the learner and training program to know an individual’s competency development trajectory. Background: Milestone Level ratings for residents grouped by specialty (e.g., Internal Medicine and Emergency Medicine) show that, in aggregate, senior residents receive higher ratings than junior residents. Anesthesiology Milestones, as assessed by both residents and faculty, also have a positive linear relationship with postgraduate year. However, these studies have been cross-sectional rather than longitudinal cohort studies, and studies of how individual residents progress during the course of training are needed. Longitudinal data analysis of performance assessment trajectories addresses a relevant validity question for the Next Accreditation System. We explored the application of learning analytics to longitudinal Milestones data to: 1) measure the frequency of “straight-lining”; 2) assess the proportion of residents that reach “Level 4” (ready for unsupervised practice) by graduation for each subcompetency; 3) identify variability among programs and individual residents in their baseline Milestone Level and rates of improvement; and 4) determine how hypothetically constructed growth curve models fit to the Milestones data reported to ACGME. Approach: De-identified Milestone Level ratings in each of the 25 subcompetencies submitted semiannually to the ACGME from July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2017 were retrospectively analyzed for graduating residents (n = 67) from a convenience sample of five anesthesia residency programs. The data reflected longitudinal resident Milestone progression from the beginning of the first year to the end of the third and final year of clinical anesthesiology training. The frequency of straight-lining, defined as the resident receiving the same exact Milestone Level rating for all 25 subcompetencies on a given 6-month report, was calculated for each program. Every resident was evaluated six times during training with the possibility of six straight-lined ratings. Findings: The number of residents in each program ranged from 5-21 (Median 13, range 16). Mean Milestone Level ratings for subcompetencies were significantly different at each six-month assessment (p < 0.001). Frequency of straight-lining varied significantly by program from 9% − 57% (Median 22%). Depending on the program, 53%-100% (median 86%) of residents reached the graduation target Level 4 or higher in all 25 anesthesiology subcompetencies. Nine to 18% of residents did not achieve a Level 4 rating for at least one subcompetency at any time during their residency. Across programs, significant variability was found in first-year clinical anesthesia training Milestone Levels, as well in the rate of improvement for five of the six core competencies. Conclusions: Anesthesia residents’ Milestone Level growth trajectories as reported to the ACGME vary significantly across individual residents as well as by program. The present study offers a case example that raises concerns regarding the validity of the Next Accreditation System as it is currently used by some residency programs. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097613392"

Intervention: A 3.5-hour motivational interviewing workshop was delivered to second year students at a Canadian medical school. Students were first introduced to the concept of motivational interviewing, and then given an opportunity to apply this knowledge in smaller seminar groups to increase their competency within the context of lifestyle behaviors. Context: Using the Theory of Planned Behavior, this study sought to evaluate the impact of the workshop on medical students’ motivational interviewing knowledge and social cognitions. Questionnaires were distributed to students pre- and immediately post-workshop to gather student demographics, previous motivational interviewing experience, current motivational interviewing knowledge and Theory of Planned Behavior social cognitions for using motivational interviewing. Repeated-measures ANOVAs assessed changes in motivational interviewing knowledge and social cognitions. During the workshop, a process evaluation assessing fidelity to and quality of motivational interviewing instruction was conducted. Outcome: The process evaluation indicated high fidelity and high quality of delivery of the workshop by all facilitators. Students (N = 27; Mage = 24 ± 2 years) reported significant increases in motivational interviewing knowledge from pre- to post-workshop (p = 0.001). Although not significant, small-to-moderate effect sizes in changes in social cognitions were reported from pre- to post-workshop. Lesson Learned: Medical students hold motivational interviewing in a high regard, as evidenced by the relatively high social cognitions observed prior to the commencement of the workshop. We learned that while a shorter, workshop-style approach is successful in increasing motivational interviewing knowledge, future workshops should allocate more time to skill acquisition to ensure proficiency in clinical use. Practice Points Motivational interviewing (MI), an effective patient-centred counseling method that promotes positive patient behavior change, is not routinely taught in medical schools. The theory-based evaluation of the implementation and impact of an MI workshop for second year medical students revealed high quality of delivery and significant improvements in self-reported MI knowledge. While the workshop was implemented as intended and based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, no significant changes in students’ social cognitions for using MI with future patients was seen from pre- to post-workshop. The fulsome workshop description and suggestions for future workshop modifications may be adopted by others interested in incorporating MI-specific training into the medical school curriculum. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074518207"

Current programs focus on educating future doctors to deliver “high-value, cost-conscious care” (HVCCC). Although the importance of HVCCC education is increasingly recognized, there is a lag in implementation. Whereas recent efforts generated effective interventions that promote HVCCC in a local context, gaps persist in the examination of system factors that underlie broader successful and lasting implementation in educational and healthcare practices. Approach: We conducted a realist evaluation of a program focused on embedding HVCCC in postgraduate education by encouraging and supporting residents to set up “HVCCC projects” to promote HVCCC delivery. We interviewed 39 medical residents and 10 attending physicians involved in such HVCCC projects to examine HVCCC implementation in different educational and healthcare contexts. We held six reflection sessions attended by the program commissioners and educationalists to validate and enrich the findings. Findings: A realist evaluation was used to unravel the facilitators and barriers that underlie the implementation of HVCCC in a variety of healthcare practices. Whereas research activities regularly stop after the identification of facilitators and barriers, we used these insights to formulate four high-value, cost-conscious care carriers: (1) continue to promote HVCCC awareness, (2) create an institutional structure that fosters HVCCC, (3) continue the focus on projects for embedding HVCCC in practice, (4) generate evidence. The carriers support residents, attendings and others involved in educating physicians in training to develop and implement innovative HVCCC projects. Insights: Strategies to promote physician stewardship go beyond the formal curriculum and require a transformation in the informal educational system from one that almost exclusively focuses on medical discussions to one that also considers value and cost as part of medical decision-making. The HVCCC carriers propose a set of strategies and system adaptations that could aid the transformation toward a HVCCC supporting context. © 2021 The Author(s).

First proposed by Meyer and Land in 2003, they can be defined as ways of knowing central to the mastery of a subject. They are framed as profoundly transformative, impacting the identity of those who encounter them through irreversible shifts in an individual’s outlook. Although Threshold Concepts have been identified in a multitude of educational settings across the continuum of health professions education, there has been little critique of Threshold Concepts as a theory of health professions education. Within adjacent fields critical discourse is also underdeveloped, perhaps given the educational resonance of the theory, or the way in which the theory encourages subject specialists to discuss their area of interest in depth. This commentary critically examines how Threshold Concepts have been used and researched within health professions education, applying critiques from other educational fields, to assist scholars in thinking critically regarding their application. Evidence: Three significant critiques are outlined: 1) ‘The floating signifier problem’; 2) ‘The body of knowledge problem’; and 3) ‘The professional identity problem.’ Critique 1, the floating signifier problem, outlines how Threshold Concept theory lacks articulation and has been inconsistently operationalized. Critique 2, the body of knowledge problem, outlines the issues associated with attempting to identify a singular body of knowledge, particularly in regard to the reinforcement of entrenched power dynamics. Critique 3, the professional identity problem, argues that the way in which Threshold Concepts conceptualize identity formation is problematic, inadequately grounded in wider academic debate, and at odds with increasingly constructionist conceptualizations of identity within health professions education. Implications: These critiques have implications for both educators and researchers. Educators using Threshold Concepts theory must think carefully about the tacit messages their use communicates, consider how the use of Threshold Concepts could reinforce entrenched power dynamics, and reflect on how their use may make material less accessible to some learners. Further, given that Threshold Concept theory lacks articulation, using the theory to structure curricula or educational sessions is problematic. Threshold Concepts are not synonymous with course learning outcomes and so, While considering Threshold Concepts may enable pedagogical discussion, the theory cannot help educators decide which concepts it applies to; this requires careful planning which extends beyond the bounds of this theory. For researchers, there are issues too with power and inconsistent theoretical operationalization, but also with the way in which Threshold Concepts theory conceptualizes identity formation, which cast doubt on its use as a theory of identity development. On balance, we believe Threshold Concept theory suffers a number of fundamental flaws that necessitate a shift from the positioning of Threshold Concepts as a theory, toward the use of Threshold Concepts as a less prescriptive reflective prompt to stimulate pedagogical discussion. © 2021 The Author(s).

Self-imposed barriers have prevented adoption of more radical pedagogical approaches, so recent predictions of the ‘inevitability’ of medical education transitioning to online delivery seemed unlikely. Then in March 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic forced medical schools to overcome established barriers overnight and make the most rapid curricular shift in medical education’s history. We share the collated reports of nine medical schools and postulate how recent responses may influence future medical education. Evidence: While extraneous pandemic-related factors make it impossible to scientifically distinguish the impact of the curricular changes, some themes emerged. The rapid transition to online delivery was made possible by all schools having learning management systems and key electronic resources already blended into their curricula; we were closer to online delivery than anticipated. Student engagement with online delivery varied with different pedagogies used and the importance of social learning and interaction along with autonomy in learning were apparent. These are factors known to enhance online learning, and the student-centered modalities (e.g. problem-based learning) that included them appeared to be more engaging. Assumptions that the new online environment would be easily adopted and embraced by ‘technophilic’ students did not always hold true. Achieving true distance medical education will take longer than this ‘overnight’ response, but adhering to best practices for online education may open a new realm of possibilities. Implications: While this experience did not confirm that online medical education is really ‘inevitable,’ it revealed that it is possible. Thoughtfully blending more online components into a medical curriculum will allow us to take advantage of this environment’s strengths such as efficiency and the ability to support asynchronous and autonomous learning that engage and foster intrinsic learning in our students. While maintaining aspects of social interaction, online learning could enhance pre-clinical medical education by allowing integration and collaboration among classes of medical students, other health professionals, and even between medical schools. What remains to be seen is whether COVID-19 provided the experience, vision and courage for medical education to change, or whether the old barriers will rise again when the pandemic is over. © 2021 The Author(s).

To flourish in an advanced educational system that may be unfamiliar, these scholars also need networks of mentors and role models. These challenges can affect scholars at multiple stages of their education. Intervention: To meet these challenges, we created a broad and innovative biomedical research-focused pipeline program: the Johns Hopkins Initiative for Careers in Science in Medicine (CSM Initiative). This initiative targets three levels: high school, undergraduate, and post-baccalaureate/pre-doctoral (graduate and medical). We provide training in essential academic, research, professional, and social skills to meet the unique challenges of our scholars from under-resourced backgrounds. Scholars also build relationships with mentors who provide career guidance and support. We present an overview of the training and assessment at each level of this initiative. Context: The initiative took place at an institution located in the greater Baltimore area and that is endowed with exceptional doctoral and postdoctoral trainees, staff, and faculty including clinicians, physician-scientists, and scientists who served as key role models and mentors. Our pipeline program draws from local high school students and a local and national pool of undergraduates and post-baccalaureates preparing for medical or graduate school. Impact: Our goals for the high school scholars are significant improvement in academic skills, increased confidence, and matriculation into higher education systems. Currently, at least 83% of high school scholars have matriculated into four-year college programs and 73% have chosen science, technology, engineering, math, and medicine (STEMM)-related majors. Among undergraduate participants, 42% have matriculated thus far into medical or biomedical graduate programs and this number is expected to rise as more scholars graduate from college and either enter graduate training or pursue STEMM careers. Another 25% have returned to our post-baccalaureate program. Among post-baccalaureate scholars, 71% have now matriculated into doctoral-level graduate biomedical programs (medical or graduate school) and the remaining 29% are pursuing careers in STEMM-related fields such as biomedical research with some still aiming at graduate-level education. Our long-term goal is to see a large majority of our scholars become successful professionals in medicine, biomedical research, allied healthcare, or other STEMM fields. Analysis of the early phases of the CSM initiative demonstrates such outcomes are attainable. Lessons Learned: This program provides experiences in which scholars develop and practice core competencies essential for developing their self-identity as scientists and professionals. The most important lesson learned is that mentorship teams must be highly dynamic, flexible, thoughtful, and personal in responding to the wide range of challenges and obstacles that scholars from under-resourced backgrounds must overcome to achieve career success. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088596172"

While several opinion pieces have been authored on the potential implications of this change, no study has formally assessed the student voice. The purpose of this study is to explore medical students’ perspectives of a pass/fail Step 1, with an emphasis on how this transition will impact their well-being. Approach: We conducted virtual focus groups from May 2020–June 2020 with first- and second-year medical students from six institutions (n = 30). We analyzed focus group content following the inductive and iterative constructivist approach to produce a thematic analysis. Findings: Participants included females (50%), males (47%), and one non-binary student. The majority were Caucasian (57%), followed by Asian (27%), African American (10%), and Hispanic or Latino/a (7%). Overall, students were confused regarding the decision to transition Step 1 to a pass/fail outcome. They expressed anxiety over the uncertainty of how a pass/fail Step 1 may impact future residency applications and pressure to re-allocate time and resources to other academic pursuits that would make them competitive. Students explicitly stated skepticism or disbelief that a pass/fail Step 1 would improve their well-being. Insights: While the decision to make Step 1 pass/fail was in part intended to decrease stress associated with performance on a single high-stakes exam designed for licensing purposes, it has led to increased worries for students, and secondary, unanticipated consequences remain to be seen.

At the Faculty of Health Sciences (FoHS), University of the Free State (UFS), numerous strategic efforts are focused on supporting and stimulating research. An essential prerequisite for the success of these vital efforts is to be aware of the research culture within the academic faculties. A peculiarity of medical colleges in South Africa is that medical faculties are in partnership with the government through the academic training hospitals; hence, staff appointment occurs through a joint structure with both the provincial Department of Health and the National Health Laboratory Services. So far, no known study has investigated research culture in this context (joint staff appointment). Approach: This study included elements of case study evaluation and improvement-oriented evaluation. We distributed to 242 educators a structured questionnaire to obtain perceptions of aspects of research, research processes, and existing research culture in the FoHS, UFS. Suggestions on how to improve the research culture also were obtained. The structured questionnaire was self-administered, consisted of closed and open-ended questions grouped into five main sections, and was distributed electronically and manually (hard copy) to participants. Findings: One-hundred-eleven questionnaires were returned (46% response rate). Motivation to do research varied by school and included career advancement (77%, School of Allied Health Professions); change the situation (80%, Academic support); develop individual skillset (67%, School of Nursing) and improve patient care (62%, School of Medicine). Perceived factors affecting research culture included limited funding and allocated time for research, minimal leadership support for research, and absence of research-related support structures as well as minimal teamwork/collaboration. Frustration was the most reported (negative) emotion (25%). Participants suggested that encouraging teamwork among staff, reducing workload to allow time for research, establishing a mentorship program, providing training on deficient skills, and more support from leadership would improve research culture. Insights: This present study reveals some of the factors that impact negatively on research, research culture, and productivity in a medical college in a resource-limited setting. While the benefits of joint staff appointment cannot be overemphasized, our findings highlight that the complex interplay between employers/stakeholders result in poorly executed joint appointment scheme/models (i.e., competitive approach) and creates numerous challenges that negatively impact research productivity and research culture. Recommendations suggested herein can be implemented by the FoHS and other medical colleges in similar contexts to improve research productivity and foster an enabling research culture. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097173156"

Diagnostic error is also increasing with the complexity of medicine. Comparing the physical examination in Ireland and the United States with a focus on education, assessment, culture, and health systems may provide insight into the decline of the physical exam in the United States, uncover possible strategies to improve clinical skills, and limit diagnostic error. Evidence: The physical exam is a core component of both undergraduate and postgraduate medical education in Ireland. This is reflected by the time and effort invested by medical schools and medical societies in Ireland in teaching and assessing skills. This high standard of skills results in the physical exam being a key component of the diagnostic process and a gatekeeper to expensive investigations essential in a resource-limited health system such as Ireland. Use of the physical exam in the United States is hindered by the high-tech transformation of healthcare and a more litigious society. Known strategies to highlight the role of the physical exam in clinical practice include creating an evidence base to show that better physical exam skills improve outcomes, identifying accurate physical exam maneuvers, stressing the therapeutic alliance the physical exam brings to the patient encounter, and the incorporation of technology into the bedside exam. Implications: Contrasting the education and clinical use of the physical examination in the United States with Ireland allowed us to identify a number of strategies which could be used to promote the physical exam among learners in both countries. Highlighting simple and pragmatic physical exam maneuvers combined with evidence-based physical exam diagnostic data may renew confidence in the physical exam as a core diagnostic tool. Use of the hypothesis-driven approach may streamline a clinician’s physical exam during a patient encounter, focusing on the key examination components and avoiding unnecessary and low yield maneuvers. The absence of assessment of physical exam skills using real patients in United States licensing exams communicates to learners that these skills are not important. However, steps to introduce a culture of assessment to drive learning are being introduced. One area Ireland could learn from the United States is incorporating more technology into the bedside exam. Enhanced physical examination skills in both countries could reduce reliance on expensive investigations and improve diagnostic accuracy. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080022871"

Moreover, the literature that does exist has generally overlooked the potential role of specialty factors in influencing such conceptualizations. This is particularly true for family medicine and general practice trainees–a specialty considered to be unique due, in part, to its focus on community-based care. The present review sought to explore conceptualizations of wellbeing specifically within the context of family medicine and general practice training. Approach: The Embase, Ovid Medline, and PsycINFO databases were searched from inception to November 2019 for literature examining wellbeing in family medicine and general practice trainees. Literature was iteratively thematically analyzed through the process of a hermeneutic cycle. In total, 36 articles were reviewed over seven rounds, at which point saturation was reached. Findings: The findings confirm the complex and multifaceted nature of wellbeing as experienced by family medicine and general practice trainees. An emphasis on psychological factors–including emotional intelligence, positive mental health, self-confidence and resilience–alongside positive interpersonal relationships, rewards, and balanced interactions between trainees’ personal and professional demands were deemed critical elements. Insights: A model of wellbeing that emphasizes rich connections between trainees’ personal and professional life domains is proposed. Further qualitative research will help to extend current understanding of wellbeing among medical trainees, including the individuality of each specialty’s experiences, with the potential to enhance interventional efforts. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107951813"

Medical educators are tasked with implementing burnout interventions, however they possess an incomplete understanding of residents’ lived experiences with this phenomenon. Attempts to understand burnout using quantitative methods may insufficiently capture the complexities of resident burnout and limit our ability to implement meaningful specialty-specific interventions. Qualitative studies examining how residents conceptualize burnout have been briefly examined in other specialties, however the specific stressors that characterize emergency medicine training may lead residents to experience burnout differently. This study used qualitative methodology to explore emergency medicine trainees’ perceptions of the complex phenomenon of burnout during their residency training years. Approach: In order to evaluate a novel wellness intervention at their emergency medicine residency program, the authors conducted four semi-structured focus groups with residents and recent alumni from May 2018 to August 2018. After the focus groups concluded, the authors noted that they lacked an insightful understanding of their residents’ own experiences with physician burnout. Thus, they performed a secondary analysis of data initially gathered for the curricular evaluation. They followed a reflexive thematic analysis approach, analyzing all focus group transcripts in an iterative manner, discussing and refining codes, and developing thematic categories. Findings: Residents described individual-level manifestations of burnout in their day-to-day lives, a calloused view of patient suffering in the clinical environment, and a fatalistic view toward burnout during their training. They experienced a pervasive negativity, emotional fragility, and neglect of self that bled into their social environments. Clinically, burnout contributed to the erosion of the therapeutic physician-patient relationship. Residents perceived burnout as an inevitable and necessary element of their residency training years. Insights: Residents’ lived experiences with burnout include nonclinical manifestations that challenge existing frameworks suggesting that burnout is restricted to the work domain. Burnout interventions in emergency medicine training programs may be more effective if educators inculcate habitual practices of self-monitoring in trainees and explicitly set resident expectations of patient acuity in the clinical environment.

Approach: Students were invited to explore the content as a learning resource during an interprofessional clinical placement on an orthopedic ward. Thirty volunteer medical, nursing, and physiotherapy/occupational therapy students participated in 10 interprofessional groups of three participants. They were video recorded while interacting with learning software that was divided into five sections: Work Up, General Information, Biomechanical Case Study, Biomechanical Risk Assessment, and Treatment. Investigators probed students’ learning experiences via four focus group discussions. A sociomaterial perspective was adopted, directing the analytical focus to how students’ made use of talk, gestures, bodies, and material objects to understand the visualized phenomena. Findings: When connecting the visualization to a patient case, certain features of the technology stood out as important for promoting engagement and understanding trauma mechanisms. Decreased tempo, showing the directions and dynamics of trauma biomechanics in slow-motion, and color coding of the strain on the affected structures were especially important for evoking the emotional responses. The visualization tool also supported students’ explorations of causal relationships between external forces and their biomedical effects. These features emphasize the sociomaterial relation between the design of the technology and the student activities. Insights: Dynamic visualization of biomechanical events has the potential to improve the understanding of injury mechanisms and specifically to identify anatomical structures at high risk of injury. Dynamic visualizations for educational purposes seem to promote possibilities for learners to contextualize visual representations relative to one’s own body. Educational methods and practice need explicit attention and development in order to use the full potential of the visualization technology for learning for the health care professions. © 2021 The Author(s).

Organic digital education (ODE)—digital scholarship largely created outside of formal medical curricula—has increased in popularity over the past decade. Medical podcasting has become one of the most prominent asynchronous ODE sources for learners in high-income (HI) countries; there have been no previous attempts to characterize their use in LMIC. Approach: Listener data from a 2-year period from three major internal medicine podcasts—Bedside Rounds, Core IM, and The Curbsiders—were aggregated, 188 episodes in total. These data were subdivided into country by top-level domain, normalized by population, and grouped together by World Bank income levels and English-speaking status. This methodology was also repeated to compare individual episodes on topics more versus less relevant to learners in LMIC. Findings: Over a 2-year period, the three podcasts had a total of 2.3 million unique downloads and were listened to in 192 of 207 countries worldwide. Overall, 91.5% of downloads were in HI countries, with 8.2% in LMIC. A total of 86.1% of listens were in countries with English as an official or unofficial listed language, whereas 13.8% were in countries without. Normalized for population, listeners in HI countries represented 970.5 listens per million population compared with 12.4 per million in LMIC. An analysis of individual episodes by topic showed that material more relevant to learners in LMIC had significantly more listeners from these countries. Insights: Compared with other forms of ODE, medical podcasting has much lower uptake in LMIC. However, there are considerable opportunities for growth. Medical podcasters in HI countries should be aware of a potential global audience and should take concrete steps to ensure a diversity of content and to periodically audit their data. Medical educators in LMIC should consider podcasting as a potentially powerful form of teaching. International medical educational organizations as well as podcasting organizations should provide resources for educators in these countries. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112754696"

Forums provide students on general practice (GP) placement the opportunity to engage in collaborative reflective learning despite their geographical isolation and disparate schedules. This case report seeks to explore whether online discussion forums demonstrate community presence and reflective learning among medical students on GP placement. Intervention: Online discussion forums were introduced into the curriculum for University of Auckland Year 5 and 6 medical students on their respective 4- and 6-week GP placement. Via asynchronous posts and comments, groups of eight students on average presented cases and experiences for discussion with peers and an overseeing GP faculty member. Context: Students were dispersed across a large geographical area and were unlikely to have peer contact in their assigned practices. Online discussion forums were implemented for a number of reasons, including facilitating reflective learning. An adapted community of inquiry framework was used to investigate the cognitive, social, and teacher presence elements visible in the discussion forum transcripts of unanimously consenting groups. Content analysis of the transcripts was performed to evaluate the presence and quality of reflective learning. Impact: The forums were predominately student-led with relatively scarce comments by GP faculty facilitators. The majority of cases and experiences presented related to clinical management of patients and dissonance triggered by the on-site supervisor’s actions. Ideas, knowledge, and understanding of presented encounters were shared and built on by positive and supportive interaction, broadening students’ perspectives and, at times, leading to the formation of solutions. However, students’ reflection was mostly superficial. Deep reflection was rarely present, and affective dimensions of reflection were disclosed relatively less than clinical cognitive aspects of reflection. Direct instruction, based on prior experience and pedagogical expertise, was the main form of comment made by faculty facilitators, who prompted with questions to a far lesser extent. Lessons Learned: Online discussion forums appeared to enable medical students on GP placement to interact positively with peers and faculty facilitators. However, deep reflection was not reached.

Despite growing interest from researchers and educators, as well as the urgent call to adopt these values, the foundational elements of cultural humility remain challenging to teach in medical education and have not yet been widely adopted. Evidence: Health disparities persist throughout the United States among a growing population of diverse patients. The cultural humility framework undermines power imbalances by encouraging the clinician to view their patient as an expert of their own experience. This approach strengthens relationships within the community, illuminates racial and historical injustices, and contributes to equitable care. However, recent reviews have shown that humility-based principles have yet to be widely integrated into cultural curricula. Based on available evidence, this article introduces the foundational concepts of cultural humility with the aim of helping medical educators better understand and implement the principles of cultural humility into undergraduate medical education. Implications: Cultural humility is a powerful and feasible adjunct to help student physicians cultivate effective tools to provide the best patient care possible to an increasingly diverse patient population. However, there is little known about how best to implement the principles of cultural humility into existing undergraduate medical education curricula. The analyses and strategies presented provide educators with the background, instructional and curricular methods to enable learners to cultivate cultural humility. Future systematic research will need to focus on investigating design, implementation and impact. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101023635"

It has been the subject of many, mostly descriptive, articles and blogs in the medical literature as well as in the lay press and on social media. Evidence: Imposterism has been associated with, but not demonstrated to be causative of, psychological conditions including stress, shame, guilt, and burnout, and behaviors such as “hiding out,” which impede career development. The authors argue that to avoid these more serious potential manifestations of imposterism, the approach to imposterism should be reframed, and medical students, residents, and physicians should be helped to view episodic feelings of imposterism as appropriate situational responses. Implications: As feelings of imposterism are virtually universal for those on the journey from medical/graduate student through practicing physician/scientist, handling them appropriately could hopefully channel them into positive responses that mitigate potential psychological and behavioral consequences and improve emotional health. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104337838"

In the context of Canadian reconciliation efforts with Indigenous Peoples, we developed an Indigenous mentorship model that details behavioral themes that are distinct or unique from non-Indigenous mentorship. Approach: We used Flanagan’s Critical Incidents Technique to derive mentorship behaviors from the literature, and focus groups with Indigenous faculty in the health sciences associated with the AIM-HI network funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. Identified behaviors were analyzed using Lincoln and Guba’s Cutting-and-Sorting technique. Findings: Confirming and extending research on mainstream mentorship, we identified behavioral themes for 1) basic mentoring interactions, 2) psychosocial support, 3) professional support, 4) academic support, and 5) job-specific support. Unique behavioral themes for Indigenous mentors included 1) utilizing a mentee-centered approach, 2) advocating on behalf of their mentees and encouraging them to advocate for themselves, 3) imbuing criticality, 4) teaching relationalism, 5) following traditional cultural protocols, and 6) fostering Indigenous identity. Insights: Mentorship involves interactive behaviors that support the academic, occupational, and psychosocial needs of the mentee. Indigenous mentees experience these needs differently than non-Indigenous mentees, as evidenced by mentor behaviors that are unique to Indigenous mentor and mentee dyads. Despite serving similar functions, mentorship varies across cultures in its approach, assumptions, and content. Mentorship programs designed for Indigenous participants should consider how standard models might fail to support their needs. © 2021 The Author(s).

Despite their novelty, it is important to assess EPAs as a construct to ensure that they accurately reflect the work of the targeted profession. Background: : The co-creation of an EPA framework for training and entrustment of small-group facilitators has been discussed in the literature. Although a rigorous design process was used to develop the framework, its content validity has not been established yet. Approach: A modified Delphi technique was used. Three survey rounds were conducted from December 2019 to April 2020. Expert health professions educationalists were recruited using purposive sampling and snowball techniques. In Round 1, a rubric consisting of seven items was used to assess the quality of nine pre-designed EPAs. In Round 2, competencies required to perform the agreed-upon EPAs were selected from 12 competencies provided. In Round 3, consensus was sought on sub-activities recommended for agreed-upon EPAs. Quantitative data were analyzed using multiple statistical analyses, including item-wise and rubric-wise content validity indices, asymmetric confidence interval, mean, standard deviation, and response frequencies. Qualitative data were thematically analyzed using content analysis. Findings: : Three of the nine proposed EPAs achieved statistical consensus for retention. These EPAs were: (1) preparing an activity, (2) facilitating a small-group session, and (3) reflecting upon self and the session. Nine of the 12 pre-determined competencies achieved consensus and were then mapped against each agreed-upon EPA based on their relevance. Finally, results indicated consensus on five, six, and four sub-activities for EPA 1, EPA 2, and EPA 3, respectively. Conclusions: : The final framework delineates three EPAs for small-group facilitation and their associated sub-activities. The full description of each EPA provided in this article includes the title, context, task specification, required competencies, and entrustment resources. Program developers, administrative bodies, and teaching staff may find this EPA framework useful to structure faculty development, to entrust teachers, and to support personal development. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100951542"

The Thai societal culture, characterized by strict hierarchy and collectivism, may have a significant impact on the learning culture and, therefore, feedback conversations between teachers and learners. This study explored: common approaches used by faculty to provide feedback to students; and faculty and student perspectives regarding sociocultural factors that impact feedback seeking, provision, and acceptance. Approach: Using a constructivist paradigm, we explored perspectives of clinical faculty and medical students at an academic medical center in Thailand using focus groups (students) and a focus group and individual interviews (faculty). Sessions were audiotaped, transcribed, and de-identified prior to analysis. Constant comparative analysis was performed on transcripts, focusing on perceived cultural factors that impacted feedback conversations. Findings: Thirty faculty participated in the study, four participated in a focus group, and 27 participated in individual interviews. Twenty-two medical students participated in four focus groups. We identified the following key themes, which could be grouped under three categories: (1) Faculty approaches to providing feedback (1.1) Feedback should be initiated by faculty. (1.2) Feedback is initiated primarily for deficit identification and correction. (2) Factors impacting students’ feedback seeking and acceptance. (2.1) Students are willing to accept harsh feedback when it provides suggestions for improvement. (2.2) Feedback is most credible when faculty have direct knowledge of the student’s effort. (2.3) Feedback seeking is considered a burden on teachers. (3) Cultural factors that influence feedback (3.1) Societal hierarchy perpetuates unidirectional top-down feedback. (3.2) Kreng jai (the balance between consideration for others and self-interests) affects feedback seeking and provision. Insights: Though the value of feedback on learning was emphasized by all participants, the hierarchical culture of Thai society was perceived to have a significant influence on feedback seeking, provision, and acceptance. Identifying and addressing societal as well as institutional cultural factors would be key in designing growth-enhancing feedback initiatives relevant to the local context.

Assessment format can also influence faculty teaching. Accordingly, our institution implemented a new assessment strategy in which pre-clerkship medical students answered weekly formative quizzes with constructed response questions (also referred to as open-ended questions) and multiple-choice questions in preparation for summative open-ended question examinations, to support students’ use of recommended learning strategies. Our qualitative study explored medical student and faculty perceptions of this assessment strategy on learning and teaching. Approach: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 second-year medical students to explore their preparation for quizzes and summative examinations. We also interviewed 10 faculty responsible for writing and grading these assessments in the pre-clerkship foundational sciences curriculum regarding their approach to writing assessments and rubrics, and their perceptions of how their teaching may have changed with this assessment strategy. We analyzed interview transcripts using thematic analysis with a priori sensitizing concepts from the learning sciences literature. Findings: We identified four major themes characterizing student and faculty perceptions of weekly formative quizzes and summative OEQ examinations. Participants found that this assessment strategy helped (1) prioritize conceptual understanding, (2) simulate clinical problem solving, and (3) engage students and faculty in continuous improvement in their approach to learning or teaching. Faculty and students also recognized challenges and potential tradeoffs associated with these assessment formats. Participants identified (4) facilitators and barriers when implementing this assessment strategy. Insights: Our findings suggested that assessment of medical knowledge through weekly formative quizzes and summative open-ended question examinations can facilitate students’ use of effective learning strategies. Faculty also recognized improvements in their teaching and in quality of assessment. This format of assessment also presented some challenges and potential tradeoffs and significant institutional resources were required for implementation. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099460131"

External feedback also plays an important role in affecting learner motivations, perceptions, and self-evaluations. Accordingly, having learners share individualized learning plans with preceptors might promote self-regulated learning by helping align the feedback they receive with their learning goals. Hypothesis: We hypothesized having medical students share individualized learning plans with attendings and residents would improve the quality of the feedback they received, increase the likelihood that feedback correlated to their learning goals, and improve their perceptions of feedback received. Method: In this multisite study, third-year medical students on their pediatric clerkship created individualized learning plans and shared them with residents and attendings by writing a learning goal on at least one of their required faculty feedback forms. The quality of feedback on forms with versus without a learning goal written on top was scored using a validated scoring tool and compared using a Wilcoxon signed-ranks test, and the frequency with which feedback directly correlated to a student learning goal on forms with versus without a learning goal written on top was compared using a chi-square test. Students completed a post-clerkship survey rating the quality of feedback and teaching they received, perceptions of the individualized learning plans, progress toward achieving learning goals, and whether or not they received teaching and/or feedback related to learning goals. Results: Thirty-six students completed a total of 108 learning goals and 181 feedback forms, of which 42 forms (23.2%) had a learning goal written on top. The mean (SD) feedback score between forms with [3.9 (0.9)] versus without [3.6 (0.6)] a learning goal written on top was not different (p =.113). Feedback on forms with a learning goal written on top was more likely to correlate to a student learning goal than feedback on forms without a learning goal (92.9% vs 23.0% respectively, p '.001). Student perceptions of the usefulness of learning goals did not differ between students who reported receiving teaching or feedback related to a learning goal and those who did not. Conclusions: Sharing individualized learning plans with preceptors helped align feedback with learning goals but did not affect the quality of feedback. Further research should examine the bidirectional relationship between individualized learning plans and feedback in light of other contextual and interpersonal factors. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081365006"

Yet, student perspectives on these issues and their implications for engagement with health systems science-related curricular content are relatively underexplored. Approach: We conducted an online survey of medical students at 19 American allopathic medical schools from March-July, 2019. Survey items were designed to elicit student opinions on the Step 1 examination and the impact of the examination on their engagement with new, non-test curricular content related to health systems science. Findings: A total of 2856 students participated in the survey, representing 23.5% of those invited. While 87% of students agreed that doing well on the Step 1 exam was their top priority, 56% disagreed that studying for Step 1 had a positive impact on engagement in the medical school curriculum. Eighty-two percent of students disagreed that Step 1 scores should be the top item residency programs use to offer interviews. When asked whether Step 1 results should be reported pass/fail with no numeric score, 55% of students agreed, while 33% disagreed. The majority of medical students agreed that health systems science topics were important but disagreed that studying for Step 1 helped learn this content. Students reported being more motivated to study a topic if it was on the exam, part of a course grade, prioritized by residency program directors, or if it would make them a better physician in the future. Insights: These results confirm the primacy of the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 exam in preclinical medical education and demonstrate the need to balance the objectives of medical licensure and residency selection with the goals of the broader medical profession. The survey responses suggest several potential solutions to increase student engagement in health systems science curricula which may be especially important after Step 1 examination results are reported as pass/fail. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097404527"

We implemented a standardized patient (SP) scenario designed to measure students’ ability to provide gender-affirming care and sought to understand the experiences and perceptions of the GMs who served as SPs in this case. Our key research question was: how do GM SPs describe the experience of serving as an SP on a gender-affirming care clinical case? Approach: Semi-structured focus groups were conducted with GM SPs (n = 10) to understand their experiences and gauge their perceptions of portraying a patient seeking gender-affirming care. The patient they portrayed matched their own gender identity. Focus groups were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Findings: We developed three primary themes in our analysis: personal connection, gap identification, and insight into medical education. The SPs reported a personal connection to this case, enabling them to give nuanced feedback, confront bias they encountered, and foster connection to their broader community. They were able to identify specific gaps related to communication skills, assumptions, and knowledge about gender identity and gender-affirming care. They gained valuable insight into medical education such as the complexity of learning clinical skills and roadblocks to inclusive simulation. Insights: By sharing the perspectives of GMs in patient simulation, this study demonstrates that GMs can also benefit from engagement with medical education, as the SPs in our study described hope, empowerment, and engagement as positive aspects of participation. This study also shows that GMs’ lived experiences seeking medical care were instrumental in their ability to note gaps, which provides valuable insight for other institutions attempting to improve students’ GM clinical skills. Further, GM SPs’ perspectives are valuable to provide a rationale and guidance to other schools implementing gender-affirming education. Efforts to create and implement gender-affirming care curriculum should include GMs in order to build partnerships and prioritize the voices and agency of GMs. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090452245"

However, both burnout and wellness suffer from a lack of standardized definition, often making interventions difficult to generalize and extrapolate to different sites. Although well-meaning, current frameworks surrounding wellness and burnout have limitations in fully addressing the challenges of improving physician mental health. Wellness as a framework does not inherently acknowledge the adversity inevitably experienced in the practice of medicine and in the lives of medical trainees. During a crisis such as the current pandemic, wellness curricula often do not offer adequate frameworks to address the personal, organizational, or societal crises that may ensue. This leaves academic institutions and their leadership ill-equipped to appropriately address the factors that contribute to burnout. More recently, resilience has been explored as another framework to positively influence physician wellness and burnout. Resilience acknowledges the inevitable adversity individuals encounter in their life and work, allowing for a more open discussion on the tensions and flexibility between facets of life. However, emphasizing personal resiliency without addressing organizational resiliency may leave physicians feeling alienated or marginalized from critical support and resources that organizations can and should provide. Evidence: : Despite intense focus on wellness and burnout, there have not been significant positive changes in physicians’ mental health. Many interventions have aimed at the individual level with mindfulness or other reflective exercises; unfortunately these have demonstrated only marginal benefit. Systems level approaches have demonstrated more benefit but the ability of organizations to carry out any specific intervention is likely to be limited by their own unique constraints and may limit the spread of innovation. We believe the current use of these conceptual lenses (wellness and burnout) has been clouded by lack of uniformity of definitions, an array of measurement tools with no agreed-upon standard, a lack of understanding of the complex interaction between the constructs involved, and an over-emphasis on personal rather than organizational interventions and solutions. Implications: : If the frameworks of burnout and wellness are limited, and personal resilience by itself is inadequate, what framework would be helpful? We believe that focusing on organizational resilience and the connecting dimensions between organizations and their physicians could be an additional framework helpful in addressing physician mental health. An organization connects with its members along multiple dimensions, including communication, recognition of gifts, shared vision, and sense of belonging. By finding ways to positively affect these dimensions, organizations can create change in the culture and mental health of physicians and trainees. Educational institutions specifically would be well-served to consider organizational resilience and its relationship to individuals. © 2021 The Author(s).

They are therefore expected to juggle many professional identities such as educator and clinician. Yet little is known about how clinical teachers negotiate their professional identities. The present research examined the lived experiences of clinical teachers as they manage and make sense of their professional identities in the context of a faculty development program. Approach: This study adopted interpretative phenomenological analysis, which is an idiographic and inductive methodological approach that enables an in-depth examination of how people conceptualize their personal and social worlds. In-depth semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with six purposively sampled Brazilian clinical teachers who were attending a faculty development program. Each participant’s lived experience was analyzed independently. Then, these individual analyses were compared against each other to identify convergence and divergence. Findings: Participants recognized one identity, which was labeled as embedding identity, containing other identities and roles. Participants integrated their professional identities in agreement with their personal identities, values, and beliefs, striving thus for identity consonance. Participants understood their craft as a relational process by which they wove themselves into their context and entangled their experience with that of others. They, however, diverged when recognizing who their peers were; whereas some named a single professional group (i.e., family physicians), others had a more comprehensive view and considered as peers healthcare professionals, students, and even patients. Finally, participants identified time constraints and lower prestige of family medicine as a medical discipline vis-à-vis other specialties as challenges posed by their contexts. Insights: Clinical teachers have multifaceted identities, to which they give a sense, manage, and integrate into their daily practice. Participants recognized an embedding identity and looked for common points between the identities it contained, which allowed them to meaningfully reconcile the different demands from their overlapping professional identities. Thus, this research introduces the notion of embedding identity as a strategy to make sense of many professional identities. Variability in the embedding identities depicted in this investigation suggests the fluid and contextualized character of professional identity development. How participants saw themselves also influenced how they behaved and interacted with others accordingly. Understanding clinical teacher identity development enriches current perspectives of what it is like to be one of these medical professionals. Faculty development programs ought to consider these perspectives to better support clinical teachers in meeting the overlapping demands in education and patient care. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109654837"

Students provide diverse perspectives and have a unique vantage point, which allows them to see aspects of the curriculum that educators and administrators might not recognize. Current descriptions of student engagement are focused largely on collection, analysis, and presentation of summative feedback in the pre-clerkship curriculum. However, medical students could potentially contribute to curricular improvement in ways extending beyond post hoc curricular evaluation. Student teams focused on identification of specific needs and project-based implementation of solutions represent one means of doing so but require a structured, organizing method in order to succeed. Intervention: We describe a novel, project-based, student-driven medical education initiative, the Special Projects Team, which is focused on identifying opportunities for forward-looking curricular enhancements beyond single courses or rotations. We adapted and implemented the lean startup method, a model for project management, in order to address the need for organization and accountability in the Special Projects Team. Members of the Special Projects Team were recruited from the first- and second-year medical school classes in the 2018–2020 academic years and provided with training on the lean startup method. Team members selected and pursued projects according to the principles of lean startup method, reporting their progress to the chair of the Special Projects Team and other team members at monthly meetings with pre-defined structure. Context: The Special Projects Team is part of the local Student Curricular Board at the Chicago campus of the University of Illinois College of Medicine. The Student Curricular Board is responsible for conducting curricular evaluation and improvement, operating under the local medical student council with financial support from the Office of Curricular Affairs. Direct supervision of the Special Projects Team is provided by a student chair, the executive board of the Student Curricular Board, and the curricular dean. Impact: The projects initiated as part of the Special Projects Team covered a broad range of themes, including curricular evaluation, technology, and student experiences. Lean startup method contributed to sustained project success and frequent reassessment across the two years of our experience, with aggregate project success or continuation rate of 68.4% (13/19 projects). We further demonstrate how lean startup method increased productivity while providing structure and accountability for a student-led medical education team. Lessons Learned: Lean startup method can be used to structure student-driven, project-based curricular enhancements. This approach is broadly applicable to other medical schools with implementation requiring only a motivated student team, faculty advisor, and basic knowledge of the lean startup method. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107991340"

This enabled 6,749 deaths through physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia between December 10, 2015 and October 31, 2018. While the death of a patient is a common experience for medical trainees, those that occur through MAID have unique features related to the methods, the timeline, the intended role of the physician in causing the death, and the request of the patient that initiates the process. These aspects necessitate a distinct approach to MAID medical education. Evidence: Despite the legalization of MAID in a growing number of jurisdictions, there is virtually no literature to guide MAID education in clinical practice. The cumulative evidence regarding the impact of patient death on medical students, residents, and attending physicians suggests a need for supported discussion and debriefing to process and reflect on the emotional experiences that follow patient death. This is especially important with MAID, in which there are unique ethical and psychological issues related to the physician’s direct role in causing the death of a patient. There is little published research on the impact such deaths have on physicians who provide MAID, or on others who are indirectly involved. However, there is evidence that learners desire MAID-specific education tailored to their unique needs. Didactic education about the medical and legal domains of MAID alone is insufficient to support learners’ needs. Experiential case-based learning with supervisory support has the potential to enhance training in end-of-life care in general, and specifically in MAID. The authors’ first clinical experience with a patient requesting MAID on an internal medicine clinical teaching unit (CTU) highlighted gaps in their preparedness to meet the associated professional and personal demands. Reflecting on these perceived gaps, and on the needs of learners identified in the literature on patient death and MAID education, the authors created a framework to guide learning at the point of care of a patient requesting MAID. Represented in a MAID Education Cogwheel and discussion guide, this framework specifies learning objectives and methods in six domains: medical, legal, moral, ethical, cultural, and psychosocial. Implications: Following a MAID request, attending physicians can use the framework to guide learners in ongoing conversations addressing these domains. Inter-professional participation can include such disciplines as psychiatry, palliative care, bioethics, pharmacy, nursing, physical and occupational therapy, social work, and spiritual care.

Background: In the transition to competency-based medical education, WBA are taking a more prominent role in assessment programs. However, the increased demand for WBA leads to new challenges for implementing suitable WBA tools with published validity evidence, while also being feasible and useful in practice. Despite the availability of published WBA tools, implementation does not necessarily occur; a more fulsome understanding of the perspectives of stakeholders who are ultimately the end-users of these tools, as well as the system factors that both deter or support their use, could help to explain why evidence-based assessment tools may not be incorporated into residency programs. Approach: We examined the perspectives of two groups of stakeholders, surgical teachers and resident learners, during an assessment intervention that varied the assessment tools while keeping the assessment process constant. We chose diverse exemplars from published assessment tools that each represented a different response format: global rating scales, step-by-step surgical rubrics, and an entrustability scale. The primary purpose was to investigate how stakeholders are impacted by WBA tools with varying response formats to better understand their feasibility for assessment of cataract surgery. Secondarily, we were able to explore the culture of assessment in cataract surgery education including stakeholders’ perceptions of WBA unrelated to assessment form design. Semi-structured interviews with teachers and a focus group with the residents enabled discussion of their perspectives on dimensions of the tools such as acceptability, demand, implementation, practicality, adaptation, and integration. Findings: Three themes summarize teachers’ and residents’ experiences with the assessment tools: (1) Feedback is the priority; (2) Forms informing coaching; and (3) Forcing the conversation. The tools helped to facilitate the feedback conversation by serving as a reminder to initiate the conversation, a framework to structure the conversation, and a memory aid for providing detailed feedback. Surgical teachers preferred the assessment tool with a design that best aligned with their approach to teaching and how they wanted to provide feedback. Orientation to the tools, combined with established remediation pathways, may help preceptors to better use assessment tools and improve their ability to give critical feedback. Conclusions: Feedback, more so than assessment, dominated the comments provided by both teachers and residents after using the various WBA tools. Our typical assessment design efforts focus on the creation or selection of a robust assessment tool according to good design and measurement principles, but the current findings would encourage us to also prioritize the coaching relationship and include efforts to design WBA tools to function as a mediator to augment teaching, learning, and feedback exchange within that relationship in the workplace. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85080892727"

The precise mechanisms underlying diagnostic error are unclear and continue to be subject to considerable theory informed debate in the clinical reasoning literature. Evidence: We take a theoretical approach to merging these two worlds of literature by first zooming out using distributed cognition as a social cognitive lens (macro theory) to develop a view of the process and outcome of clinical reasoning occurring in the wild–defined as the integrated clinical workplace–the natural habitat of clinicians working within teams. We then zoom in using the novel combination of cognitive load theory and distributed cognition to provide additional theoretical insights into the potential mechanisms of error. Implications: Through the lenses of distributed cognition and cognitive load theory, we can begin to prospectively investigate how cognitive overload is represented and shared within interprofessional teams over time and space and how this influences clinical reasoning performance and leads to error. We believe that this work will help teams manage cognitive load and prevent error. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108440845"

Most previous efforts to separate inpatient and outpatient obligations have employed block scheduling models, which entail significant rearrangements to clinical rotations, team structures, and didactic education and have yielded mixed effects on continuity of care. A full-day continuity clinic schedule within a traditional, non-block rotation framework holds potential to de-conflict resident schedules without the logistical rearrangements required to adopt block scheduling models, but no literature has described the effect of such full-day continuity clinics on continuity of care or resident experiences within continuity clinic. Intervention: A pediatric residency program implemented full-day continuity clinics within a traditional rotation framework. We examined the change in continuity for physician (PHY) measure in the six months prior to versus the six months following the switch, as well as changes in how often residents saw clinic patients in follow-up and personally followed up clinic laboratory and radiology results, which we term episodic follow-up. Resident and attending perceptions of full-day continuity clinics were measured using a survey administered 5-7 months after the switch. Context: The switch to full-day continuity clinics occurred in January 2018 within the Wright State University/Wright-Patterson Medical Center Pediatric Residency Program. The program has 46 residents who are assigned to one of two continuity clinic sites, each of which implemented the full-day continuity clinics simultaneously. Outcome: The PHY for residents at one clinic decreased slightly from 18.0% to 13.6% (p<.001) with full-day continuity clinics but was unchanged at another clinic [60.6% vs 59.5%, p=.86]. Measures of episodic follow-up were unchanged. Residents (32/46 = 77% responding) and attendings (6/8 = 75% responding) indicated full-day continuity clinics improved residents’ balance of inpatient and outpatient obligations, preparation for clinic, continuity relationships with patients, and clinic satisfaction. Lessons Learned: Full-day continuity clinics within a traditional rotation framework had mixed effects on continuity of care but improved residents’ experiences within clinic. This model offers a viable alternative to block scheduling models for primary care residency programs wishing to defragment resident schedules.

This study investigates the extent to which medical schools’ promotion criteria align with published standards for documenting and evaluating educational activities. Approach: This document analysis systematically analyzed promotion and tenure (P&T) guidelines from U.S. medical schools. Criteria and promotion expectations (related to context, quantity, quality, and engagement) were explored across five educational domains including: (i) teaching, (ii) curriculum/program development, (iii) mentoring/advising, (iv) educational leadership/administration, and (v) educational measurement and evaluation, in addition to research/scholarship and service. After independent review and data extraction, paired researchers compared findings and reached consensus on all discrepancies prior to final data submission. Descriptive statistics assessed the frequency of referenced promotion criteria. Findings: Promotion-related documents were retrieved from 120 (of 185) allopathic and osteopathic U.S. medical schools. Less than half of schools (43%; 52 of 120) documented a well-defined education-related pathway for advancement in academic rank. Across five education-specific domains, only 24% (12 of 50) of the investigated criteria were referenced by at least half of the schools. The least represented domain within P&T documents was “Educational Measurement and Evaluation.” P&T documents for 47% of schools were rated as “below average” or “very vague” in their clarity/specificity. Insights: Less than 10% of U.S. medical schools have thoroughly embraced published recommendations for documenting and evaluating educational excellence. This raises concern for medical educators who may be evaluated for promotion based on vague or incomplete promotion criteria. With greater awareness of how educational excellence is currently documented and how promotion criteria can be improved, education-focused faculty can better recognize gaps in their own documentation practices, and more schools may be encouraged to embrace change and align with published recommendations. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075235621"

However, few researchers have examined in-depth how introverts and extraverts truly experience training and practice, particularly in specialties like surgery that tend to value qualities (e.g., dominance and assertiveness) typically associated with extraverts. This study aimed to explore the perceptions and experiences of individuals with both personalities within the field of general surgery. Approach: Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, six general surgeons and 10 general surgery residents who identified as introverted, extraverted, or ambiverted were recruited from two Canadian tertiary care hospitals to participate in semi-structured interviews. Data collection and analysis occurred iteratively, and data were analyzed using open, selective, and thematic coding. Constant comparison allowed us to make sense of the similar and dissimilar views that emerged from each interview. Findings: Irrespective of their personalities, participants voiced two general patterns of responses. Some participants believed that “personality doesn’t matter”: that both introverted and extraverted practice styles were equally viable and neither introverts nor extraverts would find surgical training more challenging than the other (culture of equality). However, others believed that “personality matters,” emphasizing that surgeons should be dominant and aggressive leaders. Only those who believed “personality matters” felt that introverts sometimes needed to act more extraverted in order to succeed in surgical training (culture of hierarchy). Similar numbers of introverts and extraverts adhered to each viewpoint. Insights: Our qualitative approach allowed us to draw meaning from the complex subjective experiences of our research participants. Our findings suggest that two competing cultures (equality and hierarchy) co-exist within the field of surgery and that trainees, depending on which culture they adhere most to, will or will not “adapt” their personalities to the workplace. These findings deepen our understanding of the nuances of surgical culture and have important implications for how we select candidates based on personality. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106255467"

Such benefits include both improved content mastery and personal and professional development. While benefits of peer-led teaching in the clinical setting have been well characterized among other health professions, less is known within undergraduate medical education. In this study, we explored medical students’ perceptions and experiences relevant to peer teaching and mentoring in outpatient clinical clerkships. Approach: Third-year medical students enrolled in two different longitudinal primary care clerkships, Education Centered Medical Home (ECMH) or Individual Preceptorship (IP), participated in semi-structured interviews in 2018. Students were asked to describe their peer teaching experiences during the clerkship and to reflect on their experiences serving as role models or mentors. We analyzed transcripts utilizing a two-cycle team-based inductive approach. Findings: Thirty-three students completed interviews. We derived three main themes: (1) diversity of peer teaching and mentoring opportunities, (2) transitioning one’s role from learner to teacher, and (3) personal and professional development. While participants from both clerkships participated in peer teaching and mentoring experiences, ECMH students described more opportunities to interact with students across all years of medical school training, noting that “getting that guidance and in turn being able to teach is a valuable experience.” ECMH students further perceived the responsibility of creating a comfortable learning environment for others. Students from both clerkships reflected on ‘learning through teaching,’ that teaching served as a reaffirmation of the knowledge they gained, and that teaching experience contributed to their personal and professional growth. Insights: Students perceived their participation in peer teaching and mentoring experiences in the clinical setting as contributing positively to personal and professional development. Students from both clerkships reflected on their teaching and mentoring opportunities as a facilitator of growth in their own teaching skills; ECMH students further described a heightened sense of self-confidence and fulfillment. These findings highlight the importance of creating learning environments that foster peer teaching and mentoring, as such opportunities may lead to further growth as a learner and as a physician. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105234553"

There are claims of insensitivity on one side and calls to “toughen up” on the other. These polemics aside, such instances sometimes represent a true dilemma, particularly within medical education where engaging highly sensitive content is essential to future patient care and where managing one’s own emotions is a core competency. Parsing this convoluted and emotional debate into these domains illustrates how medical educators can simultaneously legitimize the lived experiences of students, engage in honest dialogue, and maintain a shared commitment to education. Evidence: While substantial energy has been spent debating the legitimacy of students’ emotional reactions, the discourse lacks a clear conceptual framework and we often end up talking past each other. The concept of brave spaces offers an important alternative where sensitive subject matter can be engaged with civility. Implications: This paper offers a model for building brave spaces within medical education by clarifying the rights and responsibilities of both teachers and learners in each of three intersecting domains: intrapersonal, interpersonal, and civic. This model is exemplified in a case where students reported being triggered by course content. By parsing this case across the three domains, we can clarify how responses are multifaceted and we can simultaneously avoid indictment of another’s lived experiences while preserving the pedagogical integrity of the curriculum. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101735484"

Valued learnings included managing complex consultations, mental health and substance use disorders, and overcoming anxiety related to interacting with people in prison. Learner concerns included limited patient contact time, apprehension prior to placements, and stress related to experiences during the placements. This apprehension and stress could be mitigated by orientation and debriefing, and by appreciating healthcare professionals in correctional settings as advocates for their patients. Clinical supervision was perceived to be demanding in this context. Independent patient interaction was not usually possible for students and there could be short windows of time in which to provide direct patient care, making pauses for teaching difficult. Insights: Clinical placements in correctional health services provide experiential learning of direct relevance to medical student, and potentially to general practice trainee, curricula which is valuable even when learners do not have particular interest in correctional health. Furthermore, these placements may increase the capacity of the medical workforce to provide skilled care to other underserved populations. High quality learner and clinical supervisor experiences, and program scale and sustainability, require enhanced learning support systems through partnerships between correctional health services and education institutions. Required supports for learners include orientation to security arrangements, debriefing sessions which assist learners to distill their learning and to reflect on challenging experiences, and alternative learning opportunities for when direct patient consultations are not accessible. Supervisor teaching supports include shared teaching approaches in the correctional health clinics and added student support from university-based staff. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079732917"

While many studies have assessed quantitative prematriculation data for predicting success in medical school, fewer studies have assessed for qualitative prematriculation factors influencing medical school performance. A recent study revealed that medical students with at least one year of varsity level college athletics participation outperformed their peers on United States Medical Licensing board exams and clinical clerkships. The current study sought to explore medical student, medical school faculty, and college coach perspectives about factors explaining why medical students with collegiate athletic experience succeed in medical school. Approach: In 2019, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews with medical students with collegiate athletic experience, medical school faculty with experience educating student athletes, and college coaches with experience training student athletes who matriculated into medical school. The interview transcripts were systematically coded and analyzed for themes using a grounded theory approach. Participants were recruited and interviewed until saturation of data was reached. Findings: Fifteen medical students with collegiate athletic experience, five medical school faculty, and three collegiate coaches participated in the study. Six themes were identified as important factors explaining the academic success of these students in medical school and each of these themes appeared in student, faculty, and coach interviews: goal setting, goal pursuit, and performance appraisal; development of time management, planning, and organizational skills; development of team values and teamwork skills; development of communication and interpersonal skills; acceptance of, coping strategies for, and resilient response to stress and adversity; and prioritization of personal wellness. Participants described meaningful connections between these attributes and skills, suggesting the students’ development, transfer, and application of them is interrelated. Insights: In this study, academic success of medical students with collegiate athletic experience was attributed to specific skills and attributes developed during college. The grounded theory life skills transfer model can explain transfer of these attributes and skills from college to the medical school setting. Theoretical frameworks and empirical study findings from the sociology, educational psychology, sports psychology, and medical education literature provide helpful lenses for understanding why these skills and attributes confer success among student athletes in medical school. These findings offer important insights on skill development that may support the academic success of all medical students. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110435479"

Although much has been described on those attributes that define acceptable professionalism, the characteristics that define distinction in professionalism have not yet been well defined. Approach: In this exploratory project, qualitative methods were used to triangulate three sources of data collected from three campuses of one medical school: student assessment summaries, teacher interviews, and an institutional policy. Findings: One hundred-thirty student assessment summaries, eight teacher interviews, and one institutional policy were analyzed. Three characteristics emerged that define distinction in professionalism: improvement of oneself, helping others learn, and teamwork. These characteristics are in addition to students demonstrating a clear minimum standard in all other aspects of professionalism. Insights: Findings from this project offer a first step toward a definition of distinction in professionalism for assessing student performance. The characteristics can be demonstrated by students to varying degrees of proficiency and are potentially achievable by all students. Finally, the characteristics would be required in addition to demonstrating a clear minimum standard of performance in all other aspects of professionalism and cannot be inferred by the absence of negative or unprofessional behaviors. Recognizing that conceptions of professionalism have contextual and cultural influences, the characteristics of distinction identified by this project expand the language available for teachers and learners to discuss professionalism. Teachers may use these characteristics to help inform their teaching, learning, and feedback practices. Students will gain clarity about the expectations regarding their professional behavior. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077180732"

The principles of implementation science outline the importance of considering key drivers that support and sustain transformative change within an educational program. The introduction of Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) as a framework for assessment has underscored the need to create a structured plan to prepare assessors to engage in a new paradigm of assessment. Although approaches to rater training for workplace-based assessments have been described, specific strategies to prepare assessors to apply standards related to the level of supervision a student needs have not been documented. Intervention: We describe our systematic approach to prepare assessors, faculty and postgraduate trainees, to complete EPA assessments for medical students during the clerkship phase of our curriculum. This institution-wide program is designed to build assessors’ skills in direct observation of learners during authentic patient encounters. Assessors apply new knowledge and practice skills in using established performance expectations to determine the level of supervision a learner needs to perform clinical tasks. Assessors also learn to provide feedback and narrative comments to coach students and promote their ongoing clinical development. Data visualizations for assessors facilitate reinforcement of the tenets learned during training. Collaborative learning and peer feedback during faculty development sessions promote the formation of a community of practice among assessors. Context: Faculty development for assessors was implemented in advance of implementation of the EPA program. Assessors in the program include residents/fellows who work closely with students, faculty with discipline-specific expertise and a group of experienced clinicians who were selected to serve as experts in competency-based EPA assessments, the Master Assessors. Training focused on creating a shared understanding about the application of criteria used to evaluate student performance. EPA assessments based on the AAMC’s Core Entrustable Professional Activities for Entering Residency, were completed in nine core clerkships. EPA assessments included a supervision rating based on a modified scale for use in undergraduate medical education. Impact: Data from EPA assessments completed during the first year of the program were analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the faculty development activities implemented to prepare assessors to consistently apply standards for assessment. A systematic approach to training and attention to critical drivers that enabled institution-wide implementation, led to consistency in the supervision rating for students’ first EPA assessment completed by any type of assessor, ratings by assessors done within a specific clinical context, and ratings assigned by a group of specific assessors across clinical settings. Lessons learned: A systematic approach to faculty development with a willingness to be flexible and reach potential participants using existing infrastructure, can facilitate assessors’ engagement in a new culture of assessment. Interaction among participants during training sessions not only promotes learning but also contributes to community building. A leadership group responsible to oversee faculty development can ensure that the needs of stakeholders are addressed and that a change in assessment culture is sustained. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097595975"

Background: It is often unclear who is responsible for facilitating learning opportunities in the workplace. In order to increase learning opportunities, it is important that expectations are discussed and alignment is reached between the student’s and supervisor’s expectations. This study collected and interpreted validity evidence for a tool that aims to provoke such a conversation. Approach: Three types of validity evidence were collected: response process, content, and consequences evidence. Educational leaders, medical teachers, and students of four medical schools were involved. The data collection consisted of cognitive interviews, a modified Delphi approach (with three rounds of inquiry), completed tools, and narrative comments. Findings: This study showed that the expectations of most students and supervisors were not initially aligned. The conversation, for which the tool aims to be a catalyst, facilitated better alignment of expectations about responsibilities during workplace learning. Moreover, the students’ perceived degree of consensus and satisfaction after the conversation were very high. Conclusions: This study underlined the relevance and usefulness of a tool that facilitates conversation about expectations regarding responsibilities, potentially enhancing learning opportunities at the workplace. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077389035"

Hypothesis: We hypothesized that moving the USMLE Step 1 exam to follow the clerkship year would provide students with a context for basic science learning that may enhance exam performance. We also hypothesized that examination performance variables, specifically National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Customized Basic Science Examinations and NBME subject examinations in clinical disciplines would account for a moderate to large amount of the variance in Step 1 scores. Thus we examined predictors of USMLE Step 1 scores when taken after the core clerkship year. Method: In 2011, we revised our medical school curriculum and moved the timing of Step 1 to follow the clerkship year. We performed descriptive statistics, an ANCOVA to compare Step 1 mean scores for three graduating classes of medical students before and after the curriculum changes, and stepwise linear regression to investigate the association between independent variables and the primary outcome measure after curriculum changes. Results: 993 students took the Step 1 exam, which included graduating classes before (2012-2014, N = 491) and after (2015-2017, N = 502) the curriculum change. Step 1 scores increased significantly following curricular revision (mean 218, SD 18.2, vs. 228, SD 16.7, p < 0.01) after controlling for MCAT and undergraduate GPA. Overall, 66.4% of the variance in Step 1 scores after the clerkship year was explained by: the mean score on fourteen pre-clerkship customized NBME exams (p < 0.01, 57.0% R2); performance on the surgery NBME subject exam (p < 0.01, 3.0% R2); the pediatrics NBME subject exam (p < 0.01, 2.0% R2); the Comprehensive Basic Science Self-Assessment (p <.01, 2.0% R2); the internal medicine NBME subject exam (p < 0.01, 0.03% R2), pre-clerkship Integrated Clinical Skills score (p < 0.01, 0.05% R2), and the pre-matriculation MCAT (p < 0.01, 0.01% R2). Conclusion: In our institution, nearly two-thirds of the variance in performance on Step 1 taken after the clerkship year was explained mainly by pre-clerkship variables, with a smaller contribution emanating from clerkship measures. Further study is needed to uncover the specific aspects of the clerkship experience that might contribute to success on high stakes licensing exam performance. ©, This work was authored as part of the Contributor's official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

The current focus on increasing the number of trained physicians and optimizing efficiencies in healthcare delivery may be insufficient. Graduate medical education (GME) priorities and training should be considered in order to prepare a climate-educated physician workforce. Evidence: We used a holistic lens to explore the available literature regarding the intersection of future physician workforce needs, GME program priorities, and resident education within the larger context of climate change. Our interinstitutional, transdisciplinary team brought perspectives from their own fields, including climate science, climate and health research, and medical education to provide recommendations for building a climate-educated physician workforce. Implications: Acknowledging and preparing for the effects of climate change on the physician workforce will require identification of workforce gaps, changes to GME program priorities, and education of trainees on the health and societal impacts of climate change. Alignment of GME training with workforce considerations and climate action and adaptation initiatives will be critical in ensuring the U.S. has a climate-educated physician workforce capable of addressing health and healthcare system challenges.

This transition is often accompanied by significant mental stressors, burnout, and empathy decline. Educator led resilience curricula designed to support students during this critical period often focus on teaching generalized strategies to promote wellness and lack the student input and perspective in their development. Thus, they may be of minimal value when learners are faced with acute moments of challenge and distress in their day-to-day work. The following project seeks to provide an insider view on the experience, interpretation, and response to these moments of challenge and distress from the frontline perspective of clinical clerks. Approach: Using collaborative autoethnography, two medical students documented 85 reflections on their emerging professional identity over the course of a core clerkship year. A narrative analysis was conducted iteratively in partnership with a staff internist and a medical education researcher experienced in autoethnography, allowing for robust multi-perspective input. Reflections were analyzed and coded thematically; disagreements were resolved by consensus discussion. Findings: A key theme of the reflections was self-preservation, conceptualized within two principal contexts: (i) Clerk-patient relationships, wherein we found ourselves in emotionally difficult situations; and (ii) Clerk-preceptor relationships, in which self-preservation manifested through a series of self-protective mechanisms. Insights: The practice of self-preservation is understood as the conscious act of boundary-setting and psychological defense in situations that pose a real (or perceived) threat to the clerk’s wellbeing. At best, self-preservation serves as a temporary compromise to the stressors and burnout of clerkship. We speculate, however, that, left unchecked, acts of self-preservation may lead to habitual selfishness and apathy, qualities that are in diametric opposition to those expected of future physicians, and may manifest later (when these learners progress through the hierarchy) as the unprofessional behaviors that perpetuate the cycle of the hidden curriculum. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101871721"

However, no study has assessed how these approaches change at the individual level during undergraduate medical training and how these trajectories contribute to academic performance. We assessed individual patterns of change in learning approaches throughout five years of medical training to determine whether and how DA and SA evolve during the curriculum and whether initial levels and rates of change predict performance in Year 5. Hypotheses: We hypothesized that (1) medical students have a higher preference for DA in comparison with SA; (2) these preferences change along the medical curriculum; and (3) DA predicts better academic performance. Method: Participants were 268 Geneva medical students (59% female) who completed the revised two-factor study process questionnaire in Years 1, 2, 3, and 5 of their 6-year curriculum. Student academic performance was registered in Year 5. Multivariate latent growth modeling was used to assess individual trajectories in learning approaches and test their associations with performance in Year 5. Results: Medical students were inclined to use DA rather than SA. Nevertheless, from Year 2 onward their use of DA decreased while their use of SA increased. Students with higher initial levels of DA tended to have lower initial levels of SA. Moreover, increases in SA were significantly associated with decreases in DA. However, only initial levels of DA and non-repeater status in Year 1 were positive and significant predictors of academic performance in Year 5. Conclusions: Although students tended to use DA rather than SA when entering medical school, their preferences for DA tended to decline throughout medical training while increasing for SA. Learning approaches during early study years, characterized by engagement and meaningful learning, predicted later academic performance. DA should be promoted during the early years of medical studies to foster student learning and to improve academic performance. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092195761"

However, there is a limited understanding of how students develop these skills. While training physical exam technical skills has received significant attention and emphasis, teaching and assessing medical students’ ability to detect and interpret visual and auditory clinical findings skills has been less systematic. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate how medical students’ visual and auditory clinical findings skills progress and develop over their four years of undergraduate medical education. This study will provide educators insights that can guide curriculum refinements that lead to improving students’ abilities in this area. Approach: A computer-based progress exam was created to measure the longitudinal development of students’ abilities to detect and interpret visual and auditory findings. After pilot testing, sixty test items were developed in collaboration with six clinical faculty members and two medical education researchers. The exam includes detection and description of ECG, x-ray, heart sounds, breath sounds, skin lesions, and movement findings. The exam was administered to students at the beginning of each training year since 2014. Additionally, the exam was administered to the Class of 2017 prior to their graduation. Measurement validity and reliability tests were conducted. Descriptive statistics and ANOVA were used to determine progress. Findings: More than 98% of students in four years of training completed the exam each year. The exam instrument had high reliabilities and demonstrated acceptable concurrent validity when compared with other academic performance data. Findings showed that students’ visual and auditory clinical findings skills increased each training year until their fourth year. There was no performance improvement between incoming Year 4 students and graduating Year 4 students. While group means increased, class performance did not become more homogeneous across four years. Longitudinal data showed the same performance patterns as the cross-sectional data. Performance of the bottom quartile of graduating fourth-year students was not significantly higher than the performance of the top quartile of incoming first-year students who had not had formal medical training. Insights: A longitudinal study to follow learners’ performance in detecting and interpreting visual and auditory clinical findings can provide meaningful insights regarding the effects of medical training programs on performance growth. The present study suggests that our medical curriculum is not effective in bringing all students to a higher level of performance in detecting and interpreting visual and auditory clinical findings. This study calls for further investigation how medical students can develop visual and auditory detection and interpretation skills in undergraduate medical education. There is a need for planned curriculum and assessment of medical students’ skills in detecting and interpreting visual and auditory clinical findings. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083582607"

Eliminating honors grading, a powerful extrinsic motivator, and emphasizing formative feedback may address these problems and promote intrinsic motivation and learning. However, it is unknown how transitioning from honors to pass/fail grading with enhanced formative feedback in the core clerkship year may affect student learning experiences, wellbeing, and perceptions of the learning environment. Intervention: Core clerkship grading was transitioned from honors/pass/fail to pass/fail at one US medical school. In addition, the requirement for students to obtain formative supervisor feedback was formalized to twice per week. Context: This qualitative study utilized semi-structured interviews to explore the perceptions among core clerkship students of learning and assessment. Interview questions addressed motivation, wellbeing, learning behaviors, team dynamics, feedback, and student and supervisor attitudes regarding assessment changes. The authors analyzed data inductively using thematic analysis informed by sensitizing concepts related to theories of motivation (goal orientation theory and self-determination theory). Impact: Eighteen students participated, including five with experience in both honors-eligible and pass/fail clerkships. The authors identified three major themes in students’ descriptions of the change in approach to assessment: student engagement in clerkships, wellbeing, and recognition of learning context. Student engagement subthemes included intrinsic motivation for patient care rather than performing; sense of agency over learning, including ability to set learning priorities, seek and receive feedback, take learning risks, and disagree with supervisors, and collaborative relationships with peers and team members. Positive wellbeing was characterized by low stress, sense of authenticity with team members, prioritized physical health, and attention to personal life. Learning context subthemes included recognition of variability of clerkship contexts with pass/fail grading mitigating fairness and equity concerns, support of the grading change from residents and some attendings, and implications surrounding future stress and residency selection. Lessons Learned: Students perceive a transition from honors grading to pass/fail with increased feedback as supporting their engagement in learning, intrinsic motivation, and wellbeing. Drivers of wellbeing appear to include students’ feelings of control, achieved through the ability to seek learning opportunities, teaching, and constructive feedback without the perceived need to focus on impressing others. Ongoing evaluation of the consequences of this shift in assessment is needed. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096534485"

However, few health professional training programs include PA, nor does standardized guidance exist on implementing it in the curriculum. This study aimed to consolidate health professional expert opinion on key PA categories and topics that should be included in the curriculum of health professional training programs. Approach: A three-round, modified e-Delphi process examined the opinions of 73 experts from seven health professions (clinical nutrition, exercise physiology, medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physical therapy, physician assistants). In Round 1, panelists reported importance, ranked, and scored five broad PA categories, and responded to open-ended prompts for additional categories. In Round 2, panelists received summary feedback, re-ranked and re-scored PA categories, and suggested key PA topics within the five categories. In the final round, panelists viewed, ranked, and scored the PA topics. Findings: Expert panelists felt that all PA categories were important, with Health Behavior Change ranking the highest (98.7%) followed by Cellular and Systemic Implications of Exercise, Clinical Exercise Physiology, and PA and Public Health. The Administrative Aspects of Integrating PA into Health Systems ranked least important (48.0%). A consensus on the key PA categories was considered reached after two rounds. Five to eight specific PA topics were generated within each PA category and ranked in order of importance.

Many factors have been attributed to this disparity in birth outcomes, such as linguistic, cultural, and health system limitations. However, refugee health disparities have received little attention in the U.S., especially as it relates to the training of healthcare providers. Evidence: Poor obstetric outcomes among refugee communities have been historically attributed to delayed initiation of prenatal care, failure to detect co-morbidities, as well as higher rates of Cesarean sections in comparison to host-country mothers. These inequities are often linked to poor communication due to cultural misunderstandings, which ultimately leads to mistrust and reduced utilization of healthcare services. In 2017, a Midwest academic hospital, refugee community, and health system came together to form the Congolese Health Partnership (CHP). The CHP was formed to improve access to quality healthcare for expecting Congolese mothers and their families experiencing poor quality of obstetric care. Discussions that arose from this partnership identified issues of mistrust in healthcare providers within the community, worry about misjudgment and overuse of C-sections, and a lack of understanding about health insurance during pregnancy and childbirth. Therefore, it is apparent that understanding the contextual nuances that play a role in these poor outcomes among refugee communities in the U.S. is critical in order to narrow the healthcare gap. Implications: Since pregnancy and its surrounding events are intricately tied to the ways in which different societies define culture, we argue for a focus on culture when training future healthcare providers to work with refugees in the U.S. Specifically, we focus on the necessity of cultural humility, rather than cultural competence, when caring for obstetric patients from diverse backgrounds. Cultural humility forces providers to think about power imbalances that exist between a patient and provider when cultural differences exist. We describe specific barriers to care among Congolese refugees living in eastern Iowa and explore ways to utilize community-provider partnership and cultural humility training to address obstetric morbidity. Finally, we propose ways to incorporate cultural humility training among OB/GYN residents to address community-identified barriers to improve overall health outcomes locally with implications for refugee communities across the U.S. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092293768"

The clerkship director remains an essential leader in the education of medical students on core clinical rotations, and the role of the CD has and continues to evolve. The selection of a CD should be an explicit contract between the CD, their department, and the medical school, with each party fulfilling their obligations to ensure the success of the students, the clerkship and of the CD. Educational innovations and accreditation requirements have evolved in the last two decades and therefore this article updates the 2003 standards for what is expected of a CD and provides guidelines for the resources and support to be provided. In their roles as CDs, medical student educators engage in several critical activities: administration, education/teaching, coaching, advising, and mentoring, faculty development, compliance with accreditation standards, and scholarly activity. This article describes (a) the work products that are the primary responsibility of the CD; (b) the qualifications for the CD; (c) the support structure, resources, and personnel that are necessary for the CD to accomplish their responsibilities; (d) incentives and career development for the CD; and (e) the dedicated time that should be provided for the clerkship and the CD to succeed. Given all that should rightfully be expected of a CD, a minimum of 50% of a full-time equivalent is recognized as appropriate. The complexity and needs of the clerkship now require that at least one full-time clerkship administrator (CA) be a part of the CD’s team. To better reflect the current circumstances, ACE has updated its recommendations for institutions and departments to have clear standards for what is expected of the director of a clinical clerkship and have correspondingly clear guidelines as to what should be expected for CDs in the support they are provided.

As contemporary medical education adapts competency-based models of training, learners will be required to demonstrate competency in QI. There is a need to explore how various residency programs are currently teaching QI, including how residents might participate in experiential QI activities, and the various outcomes of these strategies. Approach: A collective case study examined how residents in four postgraduate programs at a single academic institution have learned about QI since the formal integration of QI as a cross-cutting competency. Data from surveys, interviews, observations, and archival records were collected in order to develop a comprehensive understanding of each case in its real-life context and explore current and historical trends and patterns within and across the four programs. Findings: Teaching and resident involvement in QI projects increased across all four programs since its formal integration into the national physician competency framework. Two programs had a longitudinal, hybrid QI curriculum involving didactic and experiential components. Two programs had didactic-alone QI curricula, with minimal resident engagement in applied QI activities. Between-program differences were quantified with regards to learning climate, safety climate, QI knowledge, skills, and attitudes, attitudes toward research during residency, and quality of mentorship for scholarly activities. Residents in programs with experiential learning reported higher knowledge, skills, and attitudes toward QI were motivated to lead improvement efforts in their future practice. Residents in programs with didactic-only QI teaching perceived that the historical operationalization of the scholarly project as research was a barrier to their involvement in QI, as it was not valued or legitimized in their academic and clinical contexts. Common barriers and facilitators to engagement with QI across all programs included time, mentorship, motivation, and competing demands such as feeling pressure to conduct research in order to obtain competitive fellowship positions or employment. Common across all programs was the perception of the residency scholarly project requirement as a “checkbox.” Associations were quantified between the constructs of learning climate with safety culture, and safety culture with QI knowledge, skills, and attitudes. Insights: While hybrid QI curricula with experiential learning remains an effective curriculum strategy, tensions between research and QI may be a critical barrier to learner engagement in experiential activities. In addition to providing learners with support, time, mentorship, and explicitly communicating the value QI by the program, the local safety culture may impact QI learning beyond the core curriculum. Reconceptualization of the scholarly project requirements to normalize QI activities and recognizing the potential influence of the local organizational culture on QI learning and how trainees can positively or negatively shape these cultures warrants consideration. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096333834"

Medical training could contribute to developing physician-scientists by stimulating student research involvement, as previous studies showed this is related to research involvement in professional practice. Motivation for research and research self-efficacy beliefs are related to student research involvement. Based on social cognitive theory, success experiences in doing research may enhance research motivation and self-efficacy beliefs. However, the role and type of success experiences in promoting research self-efficacy beliefs and motivation especially early in medical training has not yet been investigated. Therefore, we examined if academic success experiences within an undergraduate course in academic and scientific skills increased research motivation and self-efficacy beliefs among medical students. Furthermore, type of success experience was taken into account by looking at the effects of academic success experiences within standard (i.e., exam) versus authentic (i.e., research report and oral presentation) assessments. Hypotheses: It was hypothesized that academic success experiences increase intrinsic motivation for research and self-efficacy beliefs. Furthermore, we hypothesized that authentic assessments influence intrinsic motivation for research and self-efficacy beliefs to a larger degree than standard assessments, as the authentic assessments mirror real-world practices of researchers. Method: First-year undergraduate medicine students followed a course in academic and scientific skills in which they conducted research individually. Their academic success experiences were operationalized as their grades on two authentic research assessments (written report and oral presentation) and one less authentic assessment (written exam). We surveyed students before the course when entering medical school (i.e., baseline measure) and 1 year after the course in their 2nd year (i.e., postmeasure). Both the baseline and postmeasure surveys measured intrinsic motivation for research, extrinsic motivation for research, and research self-efficacy beliefs. Linear regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between academic success experiences and intrinsic motivation for research, extrinsic motivation for research, and research self-efficacy beliefs on the postmeasure. We adjusted for prior research motivation and self-efficacy beliefs at baseline. Therefore, this adjusted effect can be interpreted as an increase or decrease in motivation. In addition, we adjusted for age, gender, and grade point average (GPA) of the first 4 months, as these variables were seen as possible confounders. Results: In total, 243 of 275 students participated (88.4%). Academic success experiences in writing and presenting research were related to a significant increase in intrinsic motivation for research. After adjusting for prior GPA, only the effect of presenting remained. Experiencing success in presenting enhanced research self-efficacy beliefs, also after adjusting for prior GPA. Higher grades on the exam did not affect intrinsic motivation for research or research self-efficacy significantly. Also, none of the success experiences influenced extrinsic motivation for research. Conclusions: Academic success experiences on authentic research tasks, especially presenting research, may be a good way to enhance intrinsic motivation for research and research self-efficacy beliefs. In turn, research motivation and self-efficacy beliefs promote research involvement, which is a first step in the physician-scientist pipeline. Furthermore, this study established the applicability of the social cognitive theory in a research context within the medical domain. © 2021 The Author(s).

As a first step in this direction, the objective of our study was to examine the perceived effectiveness and applicability of TPS including storytelling (TPS-S) in an oral pathology seminar from the perspectives of students, seminar instructors, and peer instructors (experienced instructors who observed the seminar). Intervention: Prompts for individual thinking (T), pair discussion (P), and class sharing (S) included clinical case-based questions related to diagnosis and management and wildcards with additional information about the cases. In addition to the traditional TPS phases, the experiences of the leading instructor in dealing with the cases discussed in the seminar were shared through storytelling to model good practices in clinical diagnosis and management. Context: Our study was conducted in the School of Dentistry at the University of Alberta. Participants in this mixed-method study included third (Y3) and fourth (Y4) year dental students (n = 55) in their clinical training, seminar instructors (n = 2), and peer instructors (n = 3). Data from students, seminar instructors, and peer instructors were obtained through the Student Evaluation of Educational Quality (SEEQ) questionnaire, journaling, and interview, respectively. Descriptive statistics were performed to analyze SEEQ dimensions and statements (factors). MANOVA was used to determine significant differences between Y3 and Y4 students for SEEQ dimensions and ANOVA to identify the factors that accounted for significant differences. Qualitative data were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Impact: Participants positively valued the TPS-S seminar. Students rated all SEEQ dimensions between good and very good and regarded the seminar as superior to traditional lectures. Perceived conditions that facilitated the implementation of TPS-S included the use of real-life clinical cases, instructor facilitation skills, and the scaffolded structure of the seminar. Perceived conditions that hindered the implementation of TPS-S included unequal participation of Y3 and Y4 students, time constraints, and issues related to student pairing. Lessons learned: TPS-S was perceived as effective to improve clinical learning and applicable to dental clinical education as long as its implementation matches the characteristics of the learning context. Further evidence is needed to empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of TPS-S. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090301348"

Educational approaches promoting the uptake of strategies that are proven to increase patient PA levels are effective for improving primary care providers’ social cognitions and behavior for discussing PA with patients. However, research on the effectiveness of such educational interventions among family medicine residents is limited. Intervention: Using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), an interactive, educational intervention was developed to increase PA discussion between first year family medicine residents and their patients. This study aimed to determine the impact of the intervention on residents’ social cognitions and behavior for discussing PA with all adult (18–64 years) patients. Context: The intervention condition was comprised of 15 first year residents (2017/2018) who: (1) received the full intervention, and (2) completed both the pre- and post-intervention TPB questionnaires assessing changes in PA discussion social cognitions, and (3) had their medical charts reviewed for PA discussion behavior. The nonintervention condition was comprised of 15 first-year residents (2016/2017) who were randomly selected to have their medical charts reviewed for PA discussion behavior. Impact: Although no significant differences in social cognitions were observed pre- vs. post-intervention, intervention condition residents’ perceptions of feeling adequately trained to discuss PA increased post-intervention (p = 0.005). A difference in residents’ PA discussion behavior was observed between conditions at post (p = 0.01), where PA was discussed at more patient visits among intervention condition residents. Lessons Learned: Findings suggest that the observed effect of resident PA discussion behavior being greater in the intervention condition at post may be attributed to the intervention condition residents having received the theory-based, educational workshops. This study highlights the importance of educating and training residents on strategies for PA discussion; however, future interventions should address both the reflective and automatic processing aspects of behavior and strive to influence organizational factors that impact resident behavior for discussing PA.

While in-class collaborative learning has been relatively well-explored, very little is known about how medical students engage in informal SSL or about the impacts it can have. The purpose of this study was to explore medical students’ practices and perceptions regarding SSL, and the ways in which this shaped their overall learning experiences. Approach: A constructivist grounded theory study was conducted at the University of Calgary. Data were collected from 23 semi-structured student interviews, which were audio recorded and transcribed. Data were analyzed using iterative data collection, memo-ing, and focused coding. Findings: Despite SSL being a common part of students’ medical school experience and something that was promoted by academic advisors, how students actually engaged with SSL varied substantially, including who made use of SSL, how they made use of it, the size and focus of SSL groups, how these groups functioned, and what individuals sought to get out of them. Some students found SSL helped them to be more efficient and focused in their studying, while others benefited from comparing their knowledge and skills with those of their peers. Not everyone benefited, as some students found SSL stressful, unproductive, or socially uncomfortable. While student engagement in SSL was an enabler of academic success for some it could also be an indicator of social isolation and low self-esteem for others. Insights: Understanding how SSL can influence student experiences has the potential to inform students how and why they might engage in SSL, and it can help educators better support their students, particularly in those schools that actively encourage SSL. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081732928"

Learners may be characterized as mastery oriented or performance oriented, and this learning orientation can influence their learning approaches, such as whether to seek feedback or ask for help. The learning environment includes institutional assessment policies and informal interactions that emphasize outcomes and differentiation among students. When learners perceive the learning environment as performance oriented, they feel competition from other learners and fear negative feedback. This complex interplay of learning orientation, its influence on feedback-seeking behavior, and the environmental influence and reinforcement of both can be captured through learner profiles. Approach: In this multi-institutional cross-sectional survey study of students from six U.S. medical schools, we investigated learner profiles that characterize how these domains manifest together across individual learners. We then determined how these profiles are associated with students’ clerkship grades. Measures included the Patterns of Adaptive Learning for learning orientation, self-reports for learning approaches, and perceptions of the learning environment. We used latent profile analysis to cluster students who share common characteristics around orientation, behavior, and environment. The relationship between these profiles and the percentage of honors earned was examined using multiple regression analysis. Findings: We found four distinct learner profiles within 666 of 974 (68%) analyzable responses: (1) performance oriented with negative perceptions of environment, (2) mastery oriented with desirable learning approaches, (3) “average” group, and (4) mastery orientation only. Profile 1 (M = 39%) and Profile 4 (M = 38%) students received fewer clerkship honors compared with other profiles. Profile 2 students earned a significantly higher percentage of honors grades (M = 54%) compared with other students. Profile 3 students (average group) earned the second highest percentage of honors (M = 46%). Effect sizes comparing the percentage of honors varied from 0.32 to 0.65, indicating medium to large differences. Insights: The highest performers, as measured by clerkship honors grades, were mastery oriented, perceived a more positive learning environment, and were comfortable asking questions and seeking feedback for their learning. The lowest performing students were performance oriented and had negative perceptions of their learning environments. Contrary to previous findings, we found that the relationship between mastery orientation and learning approaches is not unidirectional but rather seems to be mediated by perceptions of the learning environment. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110435385"

Evidence: Applying a student perspective of the hidden curriculum, as well as reviewing and applying insight from the available literature, we advocate for alignment of instructional design, content, and assessments. This article provides specific recommendations to increase student engagement in ethics courses and concludes by discussing whether a lack of engagement is attributable to intrinsic qualities of medical students in addition to pedagogical technique and educational setting and culture.

To assess the effectiveness of this technique in changing medical students’ opioid use disorder (OUD) stigma and opioid-related postgraduate intentions, the authors implemented two curricular interventions–(1) a modified contact-based education panel and (2) a didactic lecture–at a medical school. Intervention: Medical students were randomized to a curricular intervention and completed pre- and post-assessments to measure opioid misuse knowledge, opioid-related postgraduate intentions, and OUD stigma. One group of participants attended a lecture on opioids and medication assisted treatment (MAT) developed by a clinical psychiatrist; a second group interacted with a 5-member panel of opioid content experts and an individual in recovery. We conducted Fisher’s exact tests, paired t-tests, repeated-measures mixed ANOVAs, and logistic regression to examine changes in pre- and post-assessment responses. Context: All first- and second-year (i.e., pre-clinical) medical students at a large, Midwestern medical school with three campuses were invited to participate in a two-arm, parallel educational study comparing the efficacy of two types of curricular interventions. Students at the main campus attended the modified contact-based education panel or the didactic lecture in person, while students at the two distance campuses attended the modified contact-based education or lecture remotely using the University’s videoconferencing system. Impact: A total of 109 students participated in the study (average age 24.2 years (SD = 2.6), 64.2% female, 79.8% white, 56.0% second-year students, 67.9% attended on main campus, lecture = 52 participants, modified contact-based = 57 participants). Baseline responses were similar across groups. Following the session, participants in both interventions rated drug abuse (percent increase = 21.2%, p <.001) and prescription drug diversion (percent increase = 7.6%, p =.004) as more serious problems. Participants from both interventions expressed increased confidence in caring for patients with OUD (percent increase = 45.5%, p <.001) and increased interest in pursuing MAT training (percent increase = 21.5%, p =.04). Both curricular interventions were equally effective at reducing OUD stigma with a significant 8.2% decrease in total stigma scores and a large effect size (p <.001, ηp2 =.34). Lastly, participants with lower post-assessment OUD stigma scores were more likely to indicate that they would pursue additional training to provide MAT (p =.02). Lessons learned: Exposure to opioid-specific education with a focus on MAT and recovery, regardless of education type, positively affected opioid-related postgraduate intentions and reduced OUD stigma.

Background: Commonly used methods to assess for competency in radiograph interpretation are subjective and potentially biased due to a small sample size of cases, subjective evaluations, or include an expert-generated case-mix versus a representative sample from the clinical field. Further, while digital platforms are available to assess radiograph interpretation skill against an objective standard, they have not adopted a data-driven competency standard which informs educators and the public that a physician has achieved adequate mastery to enter practice where they will be making high-stakes clinical decisions. Approach: Operating on a purposeful sample of radiographs drawn from the clinical domain, we adapted the Ebel Method, an established standard setting method, to ascertain a defensible, clinically relevant mastery learning competency standard for the skill of radiograph interpretation as a model for deriving competency thresholds in visual diagnosis. Using a previously established digital platform, emergency physicians interpreted pediatric musculoskeletal extremity radiographs. Using one-parameter item response theory, these data were used to categorize radiographs by interpretation difficulty terciles (i.e. easy, intermediate, hard). A panel of emergency physicians, orthopedic surgeons, and plastic surgeons rated each radiograph with respect to clinical significance (low, medium, high). These data were then used to create a three-by-three matrix where radiographic diagnoses were categorized by interpretation difficulty and significance. Subsequently, a multidisciplinary panel that included medical and parent stakeholders determined acceptable accuracy for each of the nine cells. An overall competency standard was derived from the weighted sum. Finally, to examine consequences of implementing this standard, we reported on the types of diagnostic errors that may occur by adhering to the derived competency standard. Findings: To determine radiograph interpretation difficulty scores, 244 emergency physicians interpreted 1,835 pediatric musculoskeletal extremity radiographs. Analyses of these data demonstrated that the median interpretation difficulty rating of the radiographs was −1.8 logits (IQR −4.1, 3.2), with a significant difference of difficulty across body regions (p < 0.0001). Physician review classified the radiographs as 1,055 (57.8%) as low, 424 (23.1%) medium or 356 (19.1%) high clinical significance. The multidisciplinary panel suggested a range of acceptable scores between cells in the three-by-three table of 76% to 95% and the sum of equal-weighted scores resulted in an overall performance-based competency score of 85.5% accuracy. Of the 14.5% diagnostic interpretation errors that may occur at the bedside if this competency standard were implemented, 9.8% would be in radiographs of low-clinical significance, while 2.5% and 2.3% would be in radiographs of medium or high clinical significance, respectively. Conclusion(s): This study’s novel integration of radiograph selection and a standard setting method could be used to empirically drive evidence-based competency standard for radiograph interpretation and can serve as a model for deriving competency thresholds for clinical tasks emphasizing visual diagnosis. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106344676"

Background: Using validated instruments and simulated patients constitutes good practice in assessing doctor-patient communication. The CAT was designed for use in real practice, but has not yet been applied to assessing OB-GYN residents’ delivery of bad news in Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) stations. This study aims to provide validity evidence for using the CAT to assess residents’ interpersonal communication skills under difficult circumstances in a simulated clinical setting in Brazil. Approach: Cross-cultural adaptation comprised translation into Portuguese, synthesis of translations, and back-translation. Next, a committee of 10 external and independent experts rated the items for linguistic equivalence and relevance to the overall scale. Researchers used the expert ratings to produce a preliminary Brazilian-Portuguese version. This version was applied by four simulated patients to assess 28 OB-GYN residents completing two, 10-minute OSCE stations focused on delivering bad news. Item and scale content validity indices and internal-consistency reliability were calculated. Simulated patients were interviewed to clarify any doubt regarding the content and usability of the tool and their response process. Findings: Thirteen of the 14 items in the Brazilian-Portuguese version were considered “equivalent” by at least 70% of the experts. All items were considered relevant by 100% of the experts. The Item Content Validity Index ranged from.9 to 1, and the Scale Content Validity Index was.99. The instrument showed good reliability for both scenarios (Cronbach’s alpha >.90). Simulated patients considered the CAT easy to understand and complete. Conclusions: This study provides validity evidence for using the Brazilian-Portuguese CAT in a simulated clinical environment to assess OB-GYN residents’ delivery of bad news. Based on this study’s findings, the OB-GYN Department organized an annual formative assessment for residents to improve their interpersonal communication skills. This version of the CAT may also be applicable to other specialties. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088412778"

Ninety-six percent of states report higher rates of OUD than access to medications, and, despite being the standard of care, only 3% of physicians currently prescribe medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Prior studies have shown that decreasing barriers, such as a lack of knowledge about MOUD, increased physicians’ willingness to prescribe. However, most internal medicine residency programs do not have a required addiction curriculum. As a result, we created a curriculum and conducted qualitative interviews with residents to better understand experiences with the curriculum. Intervention: In an effort to overcome physician-centered barriers associated with prescribing MOUD, we developed and implemented a week-long curriculum, Addiction Week, for second and third year Internal Medicine Residents at Indiana University School of Medicine in a safety-net clinic. The curriculum included the following: didactics on substance use disorder (SUD), including OUD and alcohol use disorder, and MOUD (mostly buprenorphine), and mostly web-based, peer-reviewed and guideline based readings about addiction, direct observation of addiction counselors, direct discussion with people receiving MOUD, observation of a group therapy session, informal discussion with providers who prescribe MOUD, and, for some residents, observation of a physician prescribing MOUD. After completing the curriculum, the residents participated in an hour long audio-recorded interview to better understand their experiences with the curriculum. Context: This study was completed at a residency program where residents were not previously exposed to outpatient MOUD prescribing. Due to limited availability of faculty treating patients with MOUD, residents spent the majority of their time shadowing a social worker. Impact: Residents described gaining a deeper understanding of OUD by having the opportunity to interact with patients in a stable outpatient setting, which for many led to increased confidence and willingness to prescribe MOUD for people with OUD. Lessons learned: The greater understanding of addiction and willingness to prescribe MOUD described by residents in this study indicate that this type of curriculum may be a promising way to increase MOUD prescribing. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether this intervention can change prescribing behaviors.

Self-doubt toward one’s ability or intelligence is unexpectedly common. Prior research has associated IP with medical student perceptions, burnout, and demographic characteristics. However, understanding how student IP experiences are related to actual academic achievement could help medical schools better support student performance and resilience. Hypotheses: The purpose of this research was to examine whether there is a relationship between medical students’ USMLE Step 1 scores and experiences of IP. Because medical students receive frequent, objective feedback on exam performance, we hypothesized that students with lower Step 1 scores would experience higher levels of IP. Methods: In 2019, all M1–M4 students at the University of Louisville were invited to complete Clance’s (1985) Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS), a previously validated, 20-item, Likert-style scoring instrument designed to reflect respondents’ IP experience. We categorized subjects into one of four levels based on CIPS scoring guidelines. For students who had completed Step 1 at the time of the survey, we conducted a Welch’s ANOVA test to identify relationships between a student’s level of experienced IP and Step 1 scores. We also completed an item analysis comparing individual CIPS item responses with Step 1 performance. Results: Per the CIPS scoring guidelines, we categorized the 233 respondents as experiencing few (10.3%), moderate (47.6%), frequent (31.8%), or intense (10.3%) characteristics of IP. Nearly 90% of our sample experienced at least moderate levels of IP, with over 40% experiencing frequent or intense IP. There were no statistically significant differences among CIPS groups and mean Step 1 scores [F (3, 59.8) = 1.81, p = 0.155], and total/inter-quartile Step 1 score ranges broadly overlapped among all four IP experience levels. Within-item response patterns among high and low-scoring students also varied across individual CIPS items. Conclusions: The association between IP experience and Step 1 performance was nonlinear in our cross-sectional sample: the group having the most intense IP experiences did not have the lowest score rank on Step 1, nor did the group with the fewest IP characteristics make up our highest performing group. This, along with the broad dispersion of scores within each of the four IP levels, suggests that students’ internalization of achievement and feelings of IP are not consistently aligned with their actual performance on this assessment. Response variation on individual CIPS items suggest that underlying factors may drive variation in IP and performance. These results highlight the need for additional work to identify the constructs of IP that influence medical students specifically so that medical education stakeholders may better understand IP’s impact on other facets of medical school and implement the resources necessary to support individuals who experience IP. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087630564"

The shift toward competency-based education has placed renewed emphasis on direct observation via workplace-based assessments in authentic patient care contexts. Despite this interest and multiple studies focused on improving direct observation, challenges regarding the objectivity of this assessment approach remain underexplored and unresolved. Approach: We conducted a literature review of direct observation in authentic patient contexts by systematically searching databases PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and ERIC. Included studies comprised original research conducted in the patient care context with authentic patients, either as a live encounter or a video recording of an actual encounter, which focused on factors affecting the direct observation of undergraduate medical education (UME) or graduate medical education (GME) trainees. Because the patient care context adds factors that contribute to the cognitive load of the learner and of the clinician-observer we focused our question on such contexts, which are most useful in judgments about advancement to the next level of training or practice. We excluded articles or published abstracts not conducted in the patient care context (e.g., OSCEs) or those involving simulation, allied health professionals, or non-UME/GME trainees. We also excluded studies focused on end-of-rotation evaluations and in-training evaluation reports. We extracted key data from the studies and used Activity Theory as a lens to identify factors affecting these observations and the interactions between them. Activity Theory provides a framework to understand and analyze complex human activities, the systems in which people work, and the interactions or tensions between multiple associated factors. Findings: Nineteen articles were included in the analysis; 13 involved GME learners and 6 UME learners. Of the 19, six studies were set in the operating room and four in the Emergency department. Using Activity Theory, we discovered that while numerous studies focus on rater and tool influences, very few study the impact of social elements. These are the rules that govern how the activity happens, the environment and members of the community involved in the activity and how completion of the activity is divided up among the members of the community. Insights: Viewing direct observation via workplace-based assessment through the lens of Activity Theory may enable educators to implement curricular changes to improve direct observation of assessment. Activity Theory may allow researchers to design studies to focus on the identified underexplored interactions and influences in relation to direct observation. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110090242"

Although still part of the undergraduate curriculum, this “transitional year” gives trainees more clinical responsibilities than in earlier rotations. Trainees are no longer regarded as regular clerks but work in a unique position as “semi-physicians,” performing similar tasks as a junior resident during extended rotations. Approach: We analyzed transcripts from interviews with 21 transitional-year medical trainees at University Medical Center Utrecht about workplace experiences that affect the development of professional identity. We used Social Identity Approach as a lens for analysis. This is a theoretical approach from social psychology that explores how group memberships constitute an important component of individual self-concepts in a process called ‘social identification.’ The transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis, with a focus on how three dimensions of social identification with the professional group emerge in the context of a transitional year: cognitive centrality (the prominence of the group for self-definition), in-group affect (positivity of feelings associated with group membership) and in-group ties (perception of fit and ties with group members). Findings: Students were very aware of being a practitioner versus a student in the position of semi-physician and performing tasks successfully (i.e., cognitive centrality). Students experienced more continuity in patient care in transitional-year rotations than in previous clerkships and felt increased clinical responsibility. As a semi-physician they felt they could make a significant contribution to patient care. Students experienced a sense of pride and purpose when being more central to their patients’ care (i.e., in-group affect). Finally, in extended rotations, the trainees became integrated into daily social routines with colleagues, and they had close contact with their supervisors who could confirm their fit with the group, giving them a sense of belonging (i.e., in-group ties). Insights: Using the three-dimension model of social identification revealed how students come to identify with the social group of practitioners in the context of a transitional year with extended rotations, increased clinical responsibilities, and being in the position of a “semi-physician.” These findings shed light on the identity transition from student to practitioner within such a curricular structure. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Previous studies of visual expertise in medicine have centered around traditionally visually intensive disciplines such as radiology and pathology. However, there is limited study of visual expertise in electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation, a common clinical task that is associated with high error rates. This qualitatively driven multi-methods study aimed to describe differences in cognitive approaches to ECG interpretation between medical students, emergency medicine (EM) residents, and EM attending physicians. Approach: Ten medical students, 10 EM residents, and 10 EM attending physicians were recruited from one tertiary academic center to participate in this study. Participants interpreted 10 ECGs with a screen-based eye-tracking device, then underwent a subjective re situ interview augmented by playback of the participants’ own gaze scan-paths via eye-tracking. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and an emergent thematic analysis was performed across participant groups. Diagnostic speed, accuracy, and heat maps of fixation distribution were collected to supplement the qualitative findings. Findings: Qualitative analysis demonstrated differences among the cohorts in three major themes: dual-process reasoning, ability to prioritize, and clinical implications. These qualitative findings were aligned with differences in visual behavior demonstrated by heat maps of fixation distribution across each ECG. More experienced participants completed ECG interpretation significantly faster and more accurately than less experienced participants. Insights: The cognitive processes related to ECG interpretation differed between novices and more experienced providers in EM. Understanding the differences in cognitive approaches to ECG interpretation between these groups may help inform best practices in teaching this ubiquitous diagnostic skill. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106812236"

In this framework, identity is dynamic and shaped by experiences and relationships. Minimal work has addressed the impact that clinical care settings and relationships with patients have in the construction of professional identity for medical students. This study explores how patient interactions and intentional curriculum design support professional identity construction in students participating in a longitudinal integrated clerkship focused on care for the underserved. Approach: This qualitative analysis investigated students’ professional identity construction as detailed in 45 reflective essays from 15 students while enrolled in an 11-month longitudinal integrated clerkship (LIC) in a safety-net hospital system. Researchers used an inductive analytic approach. Findings: Students provided rich and complex descriptions of their experiences. Six themes emerged: care for the underserved; therapeutic alliance; humility and gratitude; altruism; resilience; and aspirations. Insights: Professional identity construction was observable through students’ reflective essays. Student interactions with patients provided rich material for professional identity construction, and role models in patient care enhanced this process. This study suggests that clinical learning in a safety-net hospital system, coupled with an LIC curriculum that prioritizes continuity with vulnerable patients, faculty role models, and ongoing reflection, supported the professional identity construction of students as patient-centered caregivers providing equitable care and advocacy for the underserved, described here as an Equity Identity. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075175534"

Medical schools are responding by adding ultrasound education, though the majority use it to supplement the learning of basic sciences. Point-of-care ultrasound practice-based clinical skills education is rare. There also is a lack of standardization across curricula, leading to much variability in the ultrasound skills that medical students from different schools bring to residency. To best inform a point-of-care ultrasound curriculum for our Transition-to Residency program, we investigated literature on 1) how medical students are being prepared for use of point-of-care ultrasound in clinical practice, 2) what skills are being taught, 3) what point-of-care ultrasound skills residency programs expect from incoming residents. Approach: We reviewed literature to identify curricula in U.S. medical schools that teach the concepts, knowledge, and skills related to point-of-care ultrasound. We also mapped point-of-care ultrasound expectations set forth by the Entrustable Professional Activities for undergraduate medical education to the specialty-specific milestones identified by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Additionally, we reviewed specialty-specific professional organizations for position statements and guidelines describing the point-of-care ultrasound skills expected for practicing physicians in their respective specialties. The goal was to identify any needs and gaps in education regarding point-of-care ultrasound across the undergraduate to graduate medical education continuum to practice. Findings: We found seven published point-of-care ultrasound curricula for medical students. There was wide variability in these curricula regarding what point-of-care ultrasound content is being taught, as well as when and how this skill is taught. No Entrustable Professional Activity listed point-of-care ultrasound as a skill requirement for graduating medical students. For graduate medical education, there was wide variability across specialties in residency milestones related to point-of-care ultrasound; some (e.g., emergency medicine) listed extensive milestones while others (e.g., internal medicine) listed none. However, we found that many specialty-specific professional organizations do list detailed point-of-care ultrasound expectations for their practicing physicians. Insights: As point-of-care ultrasound is fast becoming common practice across many specialties, standardization of education and related competencies—similar to other clinical skills training—is necessary across medical schools. Mapping point-of-care ultrasound expectations to current teaching across the continuum from undergraduate to graduate medical education may allow schools to tailor point-of-care ultrasound training for Transition-to-Residency programs. We provide a sample pilot point-of-care ultrasound curriculum that we designed for our Transition-to-Residency course. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093965179"

Dispositional mindfulness has been shown to be empirically associated with socio-demographic characteristics and empathy among the general population. This research aimed to assess dispositional mindfulness in a sample of undergraduate medical students and to investigate its association with gender, age, and empathy. Hypotheses: It is hypothesized that male medical students would show, on average, higher dispositional mindfulness than their female counterparts, and that older students would exhibit higher dispositional mindfulness than younger ones. Dispositional mindfulness was also expected to be positively associated with the ability to feel compassion for others and to adopt their perspective, and negatively associated with the personal distress in tense interpersonal settings. Method: An exploratory cross-sectional study was conducted. Data were gathered from a large sample (N = 933) of Italian non-meditating second- and fifth-year medical students. Dispositional mindfulness and empathy were assessed using the Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, respectively. Gender and age differences in dispositional mindfulness scores were calculated by analyses of variance, whereas hierarchical multiple regression models were used to assess the association between dispositional mindfulness and empathy scores. RESULTS Female medical students were more able to Act with Awareness than males, whereas males had higher levels than females of Describing and Nonreactivity to their feelings. When compared to their older counterparts, younger students scored higher on Observing and lower on Nonreactivity facets. Dispositional mindfulness facets correlated differently with both emotional and cognitive empathy dimensions, beyond the effects of gender and age. Medical students who displayed higher dispositional mindfulness appeared to be less emotionally distressed in tense interpersonal settings and more able to take others’ cognitive perspective. Conclusions: The findings support the notion that dispositional mindfulness is related to empathy and may have implications for the design of mindfulness-based training for use in the medical educational setting. Tailored interventions that cultivate specific dispositional mindfulness facets may be implemented along the medical curriculum to prevent the emotional distress in tense interpersonal settings and to sustain the cognitive capability to take others’ viewpoints among medical students. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090146292"

High clinical load, limited availability, and decreased clinical efficiency are well-documented barriers to precepting medical students and threaten clinical productivity. In an era of increasing medical student enrollment, these barriers have already led to a decreased availability of clinical teachers and training sites across the United States. Improved preceptor satisfaction could have a great impact on recruitment and retention of medical student preceptors and is likely linked to changes in productivity. Curriculum structure could impact both preceptor productivity and satisfaction. Comparing productivity and satisfaction of physician preceptors teaching in longitudinal integrated clerkships (LICs) to those teaching in traditional block rotations (TBRs), or in both settings (LIC-TBR), could lead to a better understanding of the impact of curriculum structure on preceptor productivity and satisfaction. Approach: Data were collected through a quantitative cross-sectional survey of outpatient physician preceptors in North Carolina in 2017. Preceptor satisfaction and student influence on productivity-related aspects of practice were analyzed with bivariate chi-square statistics and multivariate logistic regression. Findings: Analyses included 338 physician preceptors: 79 LIC (23%), 50 LIC-TBR (15%), and 209 TBR preceptors (62%). LIC preceptors were more likely to indicate being “very satisfied” with precepting than either their LIC-TBR or TBR counterparts. There were no differences in perceived productivity-related aspects of practice across the different curricula, such as patient flow, income, or physician working hours. Logistic regressions controlling for potential confounding variables suggested that those teaching in LICs were almost 3 times more likely to be “very satisfied” relative to those teaching in LIC-TBR and TBR settings and that the negative influence of students on patient flow and physician working hours had an adverse effect on preceptor satisfaction. Insights: Preceptor satisfaction was high overall, though satisfaction was significantly higher among preceptors who teach in LICs. The perceived impact of students on clinical productivity was stable across the different curricula. In an era of increasing need for physician preceptors, the higher satisfaction of those who teach in LICs should be considered in curricular design and for preceptor recruitment and retention. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075457566"

Consequently, institutions face the daunting task to engage colleagues from different disciplines in effective team collaboration. Two aspects that are vital to the success of such teamwork are “team learning behavior” by all team members and “leader inclusiveness behavior” by the team leader. Team members display team learning behavior when they share information, build upon and integrate each other’s viewpoints. The team leader can promote such team learning by exhibiting inclusiveness behavior, which aims to encourage diversity and preserve individual differences for an inclusive workplace, nurturing engagement in teamwork. There is a paucity of in-depth research on leader inclusiveness behavior in the field of medical education. This case study aimed to offer unique insight into how leader inclusiveness behavior manifests itself in a successful interdisciplinary teacher team, demonstrating team learning behavior in undergraduate medical education. Approach: We conducted a qualitative, ethnographic case study using different but complementary methods, including observations, interviews and a documentary analysis of email communication. By means of purposive sampling, we selected an existing interdisciplinary teacher team that was responsible for an undergraduate medical course at Maastricht University, the Netherlands, and that was known to be successful. Chaired by a physician, the team included planning group members and tutors with medical, biomedical, and social sciences backgrounds as well as student-representatives. In the course of one academic year, 23 meetings were observed and recorded, informal interviews were conducted, and over 100 email conversations were collected. All data were submitted to a directed content analysis based on team learning and leader inclusiveness concepts. Findings: Leader inclusiveness behavior became evident from verbal and non-verbal interactions between the team leader and team members. Leader inclusiveness behavior that facilitated team learning behavior manifested itself in five actions undertaken by the team leader: coordinating, explicating, inviting, connecting, and reflecting. Similarly, team members facilitated team learning behavior by participating actively, speaking up behavior, and mimicking leader inclusiveness behavior. These behaviors demonstrated engagement and feelings of inclusion, and reinforced leader inclusiveness behavior by creating additional opportunities for the leader to exhibit such behavior. Insights: This case study responds to the need for inclusive leadership approaches in medical education. Our findings build upon theoretical knowledge on team learning and leader inclusiveness concepts. By studying behaviors, interactions and documents we obtained in-depth information on leader inclusiveness. Our findings are unique in that they demonstrate how leader inclusiveness behavior manifests itself when leaders interact with their team members. This study provides health professionals who are active in education with practical suggestions on how to act as a successful and inclusive leader. Finally, the behaviors identified open up avenues for future professional development initiatives and future research on team leadership.

One challenge with broadly implementing individualized education is the lack of a pragmatic operational definition. To formalize expectations for individualized education, the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education in 2013 began requiring six months of individualized curriculum (IC) during pediatric residency; however, there is not a national standard of formal curricular goals for the IC as an educational entity. Examining and describing the overarching curricular goals of IC could provide a framework for discourse about and further study of individualized education in medicine across disciplines and the continuum of medical education. Thus, we aimed to describe the phenomenon of individualized education through the lens of the goals of the IC in pediatric residency in the United States. Approach: In 2017, a purposeful sample of Pediatric Residency leaders were recruited to represent a diverse sample of program sizes, regions of the country, and importance of the IC to the program leadership. They completed an online survey with open-ended questions describing formal and implicit goals of their program’s IC. The authors analyzed responses initially using conventional content analysis, then investigated whether the themes for program goals aligned with any existing educational theory. The concepts and language aligned with the principles of self-determination theory (SDT); therefore, the IC goals were subsequently grouped using the SDT domains of relatedness, autonomy, and competence. A focus group with a subset of survey respondents was conducted for member checking and elaboration of concepts. Findings: Program leaders from a diverse sample of 36 programs participated in the survey and a subset of 11 programs participated in the focus group. The common goals across all programs are listed in parentheses and organized by domains of SDT: 1)Relatedness goals (engage in mentorship, select a career) cultivate resident’s professional identity based on their desired future career path; 2)autonomy goals (create a learning plan, practice accountability) help residents plan their path; and fulfillment of their plans lead to 3)competence goals (develop targeted clinical skills and knowledge, ensure comprehensive exposure, address learning gaps), ensuring they have a comprehensive skill set for their chosen identity. Insights: This study provides a framework to describe the phenomenon of individualized education through the lens of IC curricular goals in pediatric residency. The goals for IC that emerged from this study serve as a pragmatic framework for implementation of individualized education. They provide a common language and structure to promote more rigorous and collaborative study of individualized education across programs, disciplines, and settings in medicine. They may function as a roadmap for learners to navigate educational activities and for programs to help shape the experiences of their learners and examine outcomes of individualized education in their programs. The framework can also help individual pediatric residency programs structure improvements to their IC. Disciplines beyond pediatrics may also use this framework to better structure elective experiences to capitalize on the benefits of individual education. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097987152"

It is widely accepted that communication skills can be taught and learned, but challenges remain for clinicians in achieving effective communication with patients. This study explored the patient-communication challenges faced by both medical students and experienced clinicians. Approach: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty medical students and nineteen experienced clinicians from a range of medical disciplines. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, and transcriptions subjected to thematic analysis and coding to quantify the challenges discussed. Findings: There was remarkable consistency in the challenges described by both groups of participants, with eight predominant challenges identified: time constraints and chaotic environments, rapport building, patient characteristics, reluctance, omissions, assumptions, decision-making, and keeping conversations focused. Insights: Medical curricula often focus on communication challenges associated with complex or sensitive clinical situations, but many of the challenges identified occur in routine consultations.

Therefore, all Dutch universities require all faculty to obtain a teaching qualification certificate. Yet, like other medical centers, University Medical Center Utrecht continued to struggle with faculty nonparticipation. It has been postulated that clinician teachers may face unique challenges with responsibilities for patient care in addition to teaching and research, challenges that cannot be overcome by merely mandating faculty development or a teaching certificate. This project was conducted to gain insight into factors that hinder faculty participation and better understand what is needed to enhance faculty engagement in their professional development as teachers. Approach: UMC Utrecht has had a teaching certificate requirement for over 20 years. In 2015-2016, we conducted a local needs assessment, gathering faculty perspectives about the teaching certification process. To convey seriousness of purpose and promote commitment to change, we formally engaged key stakeholders from the outset, obtained grant funding for the needs assessment, and had an outside consultant lead the project. Faculty who were stalled or never started were questioned via semi-structured interviews. A focus group with those actively in the process of obtaining their certificate discussed perceived challenges in the process and recommended solutions. Faculty who obtained their teaching certificate completed an anonymous evaluation form. All evaluation comments and transcripts were thematically analyzed using open and axial coding. A literature review was performed to contextualize our findings and identify potential solutions. We compared our initial themes to these findings and found key challenge/solution categories, which we subsequently developed into a novel framework. Findings from the study and literature review were organized using this framework and shared with different stakeholders, all of whom engaged in problem-solving. Ideas and potential solutions were incorporated into a final report with recommendations for improving faculty support and provided to the institutional leadership. Findings: Of 23 faculty teachers approached, 8 (34.8%) agreed to be interviewed; 7 of 25 (28.0%) participated in the focus group; and 83 of 156 (53.2%) completed the evaluation. From the transcripts and evaluation comments, three themes emerged related to context and barriers: (a) skill development versus certification; (b) workplace priorities and culture, and (c) visibility and feasibility of the teacher’s role. Triangulation of these themes with the literature revealed four challenge/solution categories–Competence, Context, Community, and Career. This 4-C framework facilitated communication of findings, structured the development of an action plan in response to the findings, and assured implementation of new initiatives for faculty support beyond competence development. Insights: Simply adopting requirements for faculty development may be insufficient and even invoke resistance. Improving faculty participation in faculty development and the quality of education requires institutional attention to not just faculty Competence needs, but also the factors of Context, Community, and Career that together comprise the culture experienced by faculty teachers. With institutional buy-in and commitment to change, the 4-C framework can help focus institutional attention on existing gaps in all four domains and guide the development of comprehensive solutions. © 2020 The Author(s).

Institutions of higher learning are increasingly being pressured to develop strategies that effectively address these inequities. This article examines medical education’s diversity reforms and inclusion practices, arguing that many reify preexisting social hierarchies that privilege white individuals over those who are minoritized because of their race/ethnicity. Evidence: Drawing on the work of French theorist Michel Foucault, we argue that medical education’s curricular and institutional practices reinforce asymmetrical power differences and authority in ways that disadvantage minoritized individuals. Practices, such as medical education’s reliance on biomedical approaches, cultural competency, and standardized testing reinforce a racist system in ways congruent with the Foucauldian concept of “normalization.” Through medical education’s creation of subjects and its ability to normalize dominant forms of knowledge, trainees are shaped and socialized into ways of thinking, being, and acting that continue to support racial violence against minoritized groups. The systems, structures, and practices of medical education need to change to combat the pervasive forces that continue to shape racist institutional patterns. Individual medical educators will also need to employ critical approaches to their work and develop strategies that counteract institutional systems of racial violence. Implications: A Foucauldian approach that exposes the structural racism inherent in medical education enables both thoughtful criticism of status-quo diversity practices and practical, theory-driven solutions to address racial inequities. Using Foucault’s work to interrogate questions of power, knowledge, and subjectivity can expand the horizon of racial justice reforms in medicine by attending to the specific, pervasive ways racial violence is performed, both intra- and extra-institutionally. Such an intervention promises to take seriously the importance of anti-racist methodology in medicine. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110410302"

Benefits include use of evidence-based teaching practices, promotion of collegial discussions, and reflection within the workplace teaching context. Some faculty developers have expertise in designing and offering peer coaching initiatives for medical educators. However, because of a paucity of reporting on these initiatives in the literature, this specialized knowledge is not readily accessible to the health professions education community. This gap hinders practice advancement and creates barriers for new initiative implementation. Approach: The authors conducted a website review to identify, examine, and conceptually map characteristics of peer coaching initiatives at Association of American Medical Colleges–accredited medical schools. Forty-five initiatives were included that maintained publicly accessible websites, performed direct observation of teaching with feedback, and had a stated purpose of improving teaching. Data collection included details related to initiative purpose, structure, participation, observation of teaching, feedback, and support of learning. Findings: Most initiatives were voluntary and provided formative feedback with the sole purpose of improving teaching. Nearly all used a three-phase process with a preobservation meeting for goal setting, direct observation of teaching, and a postobservation meeting with feedback. Many initiatives required peer coach training and expertise. Reflection, collaboration, confidentiality, and use of an observation instrument were frequently mentioned. Insights: This website review provides faculty developers with a knowledge synthesis of how present-day peer coaching initiatives are structured and enacted—laying a foundation to collaborate, build best practices, and identify areas for future research. These findings enable faculty developers to learn from and build upon others’ examples. Future research should explore whether there is an ideal coaching model and location for peer coaching within the higher level organization. In addition, researchers should seek to build consensus on initiative characteristics that enhance participation and foster teaching effectiveness. ©, This work was authored as part of the Contributor's official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

Clinicians must respond skillfully to this uncertainty; therefore, medical educators are using improvisational theater training methods to teach improvisational ability in areas such as communication and professionalism. This teaching approach is called “medical improv.” Although early reports of medical improv suggest promise, the collective descriptions of curricular content lack consistency. This ambiguity creates impediments for further implementation and research of this new educational technique. To address this challenge, the author presents two unifying conceptual frameworks for medical improv curricula. Evidence: Medical improv evolved from previous work done in improvisational (improv) theater and “applied improv,” which is the broader category of improv-based training in nontheater environments. The author synthesized curricular elements from all three fields of improv into two conceptual frameworks: core curricular components (skills, principles, and exercises) and core skill groups (attunement, affirmation, and advancement). The curricular component framework simplifies terminology and clarifies a previously vague distinction between skills and principles. The skill group framework harnesses a redundant and wide-ranging list of improv skills into three categories. Together, the frameworks provide a simple structure that encompasses and organizes the core concepts of medical improv. Implications: These curricular frameworks enable educators and learners to more easily understand the scope and depth of medical improv concepts and to identify areas where medical improv could enhance existing medical education strategies. For example, there is substantial overlap between improvisation skills and current curricular objectives for communication skills, as outlined by Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education benchmarks (e.g., Milestones, Competencies, Entrustable Professional Activities). Medical improv courses could be an efficient way to achieve many of these objectives. In addition, improv-based exercises represent an experiential learning modality that is underutilized in communication skills training; therefore, exercises could be integrated into existing coursework to bridge the learning pathway between texts and simulation. Furthermore, the deliberate cultivation of affirmation skills could enhance resilience and wellness in clinical and learning environments. In summary, through their conceptual simplicity, these curricular frameworks for medical improv can help educators understand, study, and optimize teaching of improvisation in medical education. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059316603"

In the United States, physicians have been complicit in multiple historical reproductive injustices, involving coercive sterilization of thousands of people of color, low income, and disabilities. Currently, reproductive injustices continue to occur; however, physicians have no formal RJ medical education to address injustices. The objective of this study was to engage leading advocates within the movement using a Delphi method to identify critical components for such a curriculum. Approach: In 2016, we invited 65 RJ advocates and leaders to participate in an expert panel to design RJ medical education. A 3-round Delphi survey was distributed electronically to identify content for inclusion in an RJ curriculum. In the next 2 survey rounds, experts offered feedback and revisions and rated agreement with including content recommendations in the final curriculum. We calculated descriptive statistics to analyze quantitative data. A team with educational expertise wrote learning outcomes based on expert content recommendations. Findings: Of the 65 RJ advocates and leaders invited, 41 participated on the expert panel of the Delphi survey. In the first survey, the expert panel recommended 58 RJ content areas through open-ended response. Over the next 2 rounds, there was consensus among the panel to include 52 of 58 of these areas in the curriculum. Recommended content fell into 11 broad domains: access, disparities, and structural competency; advocacy; approaches to reproductive healthcare; contemporary law and policy; cultural safety; historical injustices; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, and intersex health; oppression, power, and bias training; patient care; reproductive health; and RJ definitions. The 97 learning outcomes created from this process represented both unique and existing educational elements. Insights: A collaborative methodology infused with RJ values can bridge experts in advocacy and academics. New learning outcomes identified through this process can enhance medical education; however, it is just as important to consider education in RJ approaches to care as it is knowledge about that care. We must explore the pedagogic process of RJ medical education while considering that expertise in this area may exist outside of the medical community and thus there is a need to partner with RJ advocates. Finally, we expect to use innovative teaching methods to transform medical education and achieve an RJ focus. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Background: Cross-cover events occur in hospitalized patients when the primary team is absent. Documentation is critical for safe transitions of care. The quality of documentation for cross-cover events remains unknown, and no standardized tool exists for assessment. Approach: We created an assessment tool for cross-cover note quality with content validation based on input from 15 experts. We measured interrater reliability of the tool and scored cross-cover note quality for hospitalized patients with overnight rapid response team activation on internal medicine services at 2 academic hospitals for 1 year. Patients with a code blue or a clinically insignificant event were excluded. The presence of a note, writer identity (resident or faculty), time from rapid response to documentation, note content (subjective and objective information, diagnosis, and plan), and patient outcomes were compared. Results: The instrument included 8 items to determine quality of cross-cover documentation: reason for physician notification, note written within 6 hours, subjective and objective patient information, diagnosis, treatment, level of care, and whether the attending physician was notified. The mean Cohen's kappa coefficient demonstrated good interrater agreement at 0.76. The instrument was scored in 222 patients with cross-cover notes. Notes documented by faculty scored higher in quality than residents (89% vs. 74% of 8 items present, p <.001). Cross-cover notes often lacked subjective information, diagnosis, and notification of attending, which was present in 60%, 62%, and 7% of notes, respectively. Conclusions: This study presents reliability evidence for an 8-item assessment tool to measure quality of documentation of cross-cover events and indicates improvement is needed for cross-cover education and safe transitions of care in acutely decompensating medical patients. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062722159"

Numerous contributing factors have been identified, including insufficient time for direct observation and feedback, poorly understood purpose, inadequate training, disbelief in the formative intent, inauthentic resident-patient clinical interactions, undermining of resident autonomy, lack of trust between the faculty-resident dyad, and low-quality feedback information that lacks credibility. Strategies are urgently needed to overcome these challenges and more effectively engage faculty and residents in direct observation and feedback. Otherwise, the primary goals of supporting both formative and summative assessment will not be realized and the viability of competency-based medical education will be threatened. Intervention: Toward this end, recent studies have recommended numerous strategies to overcome these barriers: protected time for direct observation and feedback; ongoing faculty and resident training on goals and bidirectional, co-constructed feedback; repeated direct observations and feedback within a longitudinal resident-supervisor relationship; utilization of assessment tools with evidence for validity; and monitoring for engagement. Given the complexity of the problem, it is likely that bundling multiple strategies together will be necessary to overcome the challenges. The Direct Observation Structured Feedback Program (DOSFP) incorporated many of the recommended features, including protected time for direct observation and feedback within longitudinal faculty-resident relationships. Using a qualitative thematic approach the authors conducted semi-structured interviews, during February and March, 2019, with 10 supervisors and ten residents. Participants were asked to reflect on their experiences. Interview guide questions explored key themes from the literature on direct observation and feedback. Transcripts were anonymized. Two authors independently and iteratively coded the transcripts. Coding was theory-driven and differences were discussed until consensus was reached. The authors then explored the relationships between the codes and used a semantic approach to construct themes. Context: The DOSFP was implemented in a psychiatry continuity clinic for second and third year residents. Impact: Faculty and residents were aligned around the goals. They both perceived the DOSFP as focused on growth rather than judgment even though residents understood that the feedback had both formative and summative purposes. The DOSFP facilitated educational alliances characterized by trust and respect. With repeated practice within a longitudinal relationship, trainees dropped the performance orientation and described their interactions with patients as authentic. Residents generally perceived the feedback as credible, described feedback quality as high, and valued the two-way conversation. However, when receiving feedback with which they did not agree, residents demurred or, at most, would ask a clarifying question, but then internally discounted the feedback. Lessons Learned: Direct observation and structured feedback programs that bundle recent recommendations may overcome many of the challenges identified by previous research. Yet, residents discounted disagreeable feedback, illustrating a significant limitation and the need for other strategies that help residents reconcile conflict between external data and one’s self-appraisal. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087009798"

In medical contexts, this may involve referring to a person as a disease, body part, or other health-related noun. In this study, we explore the use of metonymy in medical students’ reflective writing. Approach: Using content analysis, we identified all usages of metonymy in a sample of 802 medical student reflective essays. We analyzed them for associated themes and used the Fisher’s exact test to compare frequencies of clinical ethics themes that occurred in the essays with metonymy to those without metonymy. Findings: Metonymy was used 60 times in the essays. The uses were grouped into thematic clusters of substance abuse (n = 27), illness (n = 9), body part (n = 4), clinical status (n = 6), reproductive health (n = 5), challenging clinical situations (n = 6), and other thoughts on patients as people (n = 3). Several ethical themes associated with essays using metonymy (p <.05): moral distress, substance abuse, adequate treatment, jumping to conclusions, awakening, and pain. Insights: Metonymy was relatively uncommon, and some students explicitly described the practice as dehumanizing to patients. Even so, metonymy did present in a variety of forms and was used most frequently to describe individuals with substance use disorders. Essays involving metonymy were more likely to describe a scenario that elicited moral distress in the students, which may indicate that metonymy occurs more frequently in some troubling situations. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065641336"

Intervention: Clinical clerkships at our institution were restructured to decrease fragmentation of supervision and foster an educational alliance between faculty and student. A mixed-methods approach was used to study the impact of this curriculum reform on the student experience in the obstetrics and gynecology clerkship. Student participation in patient care was assessed by comparing the number of common obstetric procedures performed before and after clerkship reform. Separate qualitative analyses of comments from student surveys and a faculty focus group revealed themes impacting student involvement. The supervisor–trainee relationship was further investigated by analysis of “rich picture” discussions with students and faculty. Context: Clerkships in the 3rd year of our 4-year undergraduate medical curriculum were converted from an experience fragmented by both didactic activities and multiple faculty supervisors to one with a single supervisor and the elimination of competing activities. Outcomes: Students in the revised clerkship performed twice the number of obstetric procedures. Objective measures (United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 scores, receiving clerkship honors, self-reported interest in obstetrics, and gender) did not correlate with the number of procedures performed by students. Qualitative analysis of student survey comments revealed that procedure numbers were influenced by being proactive, having a supervisor with a propensity to teach (trust), and contextual factors (busy service or competition with other learners). Themes identified by faculty that influenced student participation included relationship continuity; growth of patient care skills; and observed student engagement, interest, and confidence. The quality of the relationship was cited by both students and faculty as a factor influencing meaningful clinical participation. Discussions of “rich pictures” drawn by students and faculty revealed that relationships are influenced by continuity, early alignment of goals, and the engagement and attitude of both student and faculty. Lessons Learned: Clinical curricular reforms that strengthen the continuity of the supervisor–trainee relationship promote mutual trust and can result in a more meaningful training experience in less time. Reciprocal engagement and early alignment of goals between supervisor and trainee are critical for creating a positive relationship. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055103944"

Historically, health care providers did not receive systematic and longitudinal training in refugee health. There is increasing interest among educators in developing educational opportunities for medical students to gain more training on how to care for this population. The aim of this scoping review was to identify and analyze existing literature on educational content and methods of delivery in Undergraduate Medical Education (UME) curricula related to refugees. Approach: The authors conducted a scoping review. Our search was conducted in seven electronic bibliographic databases. The search strategy was restricted to English language and scholarly articles. Three members of the research team tabulated and summarized extracted data. A qualitative thematic analysis was conducted to present findings. Findings: Of the 717 publications found, 24 met our inclusion criteria. The articles included in this review were published between 2003 and 2019. Thirteen (57.6%) were descriptive papers, three (11.5%) qualitative, four (15.3%) quantitative, and one (3.8%) mixed methods. Other publications included one commentary, one letter to the editor, and one review paper. Three main descriptive themes were identified: (1) Content related to refugees’ curriculum, (2) Teaching strategies, and (3) Learning outcomes. Insights: Studies included in our review suggest that delivering refugee health curricula to medical students improve self-perception of cross-cultural knowledge, communication, and physical exam skills that are necessary to deliver proper healthcare. Medical schools should focus on developing a longitudinal and standardized approach to teaching refugee health through the use of interactive and diverse learning methods while engaging with the community to ensure a better provision of health care for vulnerable populations. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087149968"

Determining factors in the learning environment that support self-compassion is critical for developing such interventions. What is already known in terms of environmental or contextual factors is that learning environments that are supportive of students’ basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness result in better learning and wellbeing outcomes. As such, satisfaction of basic psychological needs in the learning environment was tested for potential effects on self-compassion among medical students. Hypothesis: It was hypothesized that medical students who perceived their needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness were supported in the learning environment would be more likely to respond to stressors and challenges by means of positive processes of self-compassion (common humanity, mindfulness, self-kindness) and less likely by means of negative processes of self-compassion (isolation, over-identification, self-judgment). Two models were tested: Model 1 contained the effects of the needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness on two factors of self-compassion that comprise three positive and three negative processes, respectively. Model 2 contained the direct effects of the psychological needs on six individual processes of self-compassion. Method: Using two online surveys, authors collected data from medical students (n = 195) at a large Canadian university. The authors used the 12-item basic psychological needs scale to measure the degree of satisfaction of students’ needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness in the learning environment, as perceived by students. The 12-item self-compassion scale was used to measure the degree of compassion students exhibited toward themselves in challenging times in the medical program. The authors used structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the hypothesized relationships between basic psychological needs satisfaction and self-compassion. Results: The SEM results for Model 2 indicated an improved model fit over Model 1; however, not all the hypothesized effects were determined to be significant in the two models. In the better fitting model (Model 2), significant effects were observed between the needs for competence and relatedness and the three negative processes of self-compassion (isolation, over-identification, self-judgement). Specifically, the need for relatedness had comparable effects on all three negative processes of self-compassion. The need for competence had a significant effect only on isolation. The need for autonomy had no effects on self-compassion processes. None of the effects involving the positive processes of self-compassion (common humanity, mindfulness, self-kindness) were significant. Conclusions: Satisfaction of medical students’ needs for competence and relatedness in the learning environment appears to reduce the negative processes of self-compassion. Future research is needed to determine why basic psychological needs satisfaction appears to have no effects on the positive processes of self-compassion and what factors are likely to foster these beneficial processes among medical students. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074038441"

Students receive preclinical training in the social and behavioral sciences, often including learning about “difficult patient” interactions, yet little is known about their desire for training during clinical education. We explored students’ strategies in these difficult clinical interactions, whether they felt prepared by the curriculum, and what support they would have liked. These data inform proposed strategies for supporting clinical learning. Approach: We interviewed 4th-year students about interactions with patients toward whom they felt negative emotions and sought to identify strategies and supports needed in these interactions. Interviews ended when theoretical sufficiency was achieved. We used qualitative content analysis to organize strategies into themes about areas benefiting from curricular supports. We mapped students’ desired curricular support examples to cognitive apprenticeship teaching methods—modeling, coaching, reflection, scaffolding, exploration, and articulation—and aligned them with traditional pedagogical techniques. Findings: We interviewed 26 medical students (44 volunteered/180 invited). Their strategies formed five themes: finding empathy (with a subtheme of focusing on social determinants of health), using learned communication approaches, anticipating challenging interactions, seeking support, and considering it an opportunity for more responsibility. Students described ideal clinical teaching, including postinteraction debriefs with an emphasis on validating their emotional reactions and challenges. Students mentioned all cognitive apprenticeship teaching methods, most prominently modeling (observing supervisors in such interactions) and supported oral reflection. They also identified a need for faculty and resident development to enact these teaching methods. Insights: Although students use some learned strategies in interactions in which they feel negative emotions toward patients, they desire more preparation and support during their clinical rotations. Their desires map to traditional pedagogical techniques and to methods of cognitive apprenticeship. Our findings point to the need to use these techniques to enhance clinical learning for students who experience emotionally challenging patient interactions. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058699838"

The factors are defined in terms of the degree the student perceives that they have control over their environment, that the coursework is useful to their future, that they can succeed in the course, that the course and instructional methods are interesting, and that the teacher cares about their wellbeing and their success respectively. Background: A valid measure of medical students’ academic motivation would provide medical teachers with a method for evaluating the motivational aspect of their course and provide focus for changes in teaching and learning to improve medical student engagement. While the MUSIC® Inventory structure has been validated in the tertiary setting and with several professional programs, it has not been validated with medical students. The aim of this study was to use both classical test theory and Rasch modeling to assess the reliability and confirm the structure of the five-factor model of the MUSIC® Inventory with medical students. Approach: One-hundred-fifty-two medical students completed the 26-item inventory. Descriptive statistics, internal consistency, correlations between factors, confirmatory factor analysis, and Rasch analysis using the rating scale model were performed to determine reliability and validity. Findings: The five factors showed good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha.87 –.92). Correlations between factors were moderate to high (r =.38 –.89). Confirmatory factor analysis highlighted inconsistencies in factor loadings of three of the items hypothesized to measure interest. Rasch analysis using the rating scale model showed that all items for each factor had good item fit (0.65–1.37). Person separation (2.28–2.85) and reliability (.84 –.91) scores indicated that the scales were able to differentiate different levels of respondents. Item separation (2.25–6.97) and reliability scores (.83 –.98) indicated that the items of the scales were being differentiated by the respondents. Conclusions: Rasch analysis indicates that the five factors of academic motivation measured by the MUSIC® Inventory account for the response patterns in data from medical students. However, while the factors of empowerment, usefulness, success, and caring showed expected reliability and validity using classical analysis, three of the interest items cross-loaded on to the usefulness factor. Possible reasons may include ambiguity of language for the items or medical students’ conception of usefulness and interest. Future research will explore medical students’ understanding of the language used to measure these factors in further detail. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084290123"

When faced with uncertainties in a new curriculum, confidence in achieving academic goals may be threatened. We previously found associations between academic performance and pride, hope, anxiety, and shame in medical students. Are these emotions still associated in the context of an evolving curriculum? Approach: All 1st- and 2nd-year medical students were invited to participate in a survey study (n = 264). Year 1 students were in the first semester of the new curriculum. The Hope, Pride, Shame, and Anxiety subscales of the Achievement Emotions Questionnaire and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) General Survey for Students were administered in fall 2017. Academic performance (semester overall percentage) was matched to participants completing all 4 questionnaires. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the results. Findings: Response rates for those who completed every survey administered was 18.5%. Combined data from the classes revealed relationships between academic performance with MBI subscale-professional efficacy (r =.577), hope (r =.497), pride (r =.411), anxiety (r = −.307), and shame (r = −.402). Upon analyzing data from each class, professional efficacy (M1: r =.535; M2: r =.674) and pride (M1: r =.591; M2: r =.450) were correlated to academic performance. In a stepwise regression model, professional efficacy was the only predictor of academic performance (B =.560, t = 3.82, R2 =.31). Insights: When faced with challenges from medical school, positive emotions strengthen self-efficacy, allowing students to identify strategies to accomplish academic goals. Although it is important to acknowledge the emotions that students experience, our finding that professional efficacy was the most significant predictor of academic performance suggests the need for strategies to enhance self-efficacy. Use of flipped classrooms or problem-based learning offers opportunities for cognitive appraisal to foster their self-efficacy. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066839194"

To capitalize on the perspective of women faculty with established careers in academic medicine and to bring theory to the largely descriptive research on gender inequity in academic medicine, the authors used the Theory of Gendered Organizations to demonstrate how academic medical centers function as inherently gendered organizations. Approach: The authors recruited women faculty with established careers at one academic medical center based on purposeful and snowball sampling and interviewed 30 participants in Summer/Fall 2018. They coded and analyzed data inductively. In later stages of analysis they used sensitizing concepts from the Theory of Gendered Organizations to guide our focus on formal expectations of, and informal interactions in, the academic medical center. Findings: The disjuncture, i.e., “lip service”, between formal expectations intended to be gender-neutral and informal interactions that advantaged men demonstrated how the academic medical center functioned as a gendered organization. Participants experienced these interactions as being treated differently than men and/or being stereotyped. As their careers progressed, participants recognized gender inequity as embedded in the organization, or as they said, “the way things were stacked”. Subsequent to this recognition, they navigated this gendered organization by advocating for themselves and younger women faculty. Insights: Women with established careers in academic medicine experienced gender inequity as embedded in the organization but navigate gendered interactions by advocating for themselves and for younger women. Using the Theory of Gendered Organizations as an analytic lens demonstrates how academic medical centers function as gendered organizations; these findings can inform both theory-based research and pragmatic change strategies. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086268831"

In response to problems with traditional forms of didactic education, many residency programs have transitioned to Academic Half Day (AHD), a curricular model in which learning is condensed into half-day blocks. In this model, trainees have protected educational time free from clinical responsibilities. However, an understanding of the impact on attending physicians and patient care when residents depart clinical sites for learning activities has not been well described. We sought to explore attending physicians’ perspectives when residents depart clinical sites to attend AHD. Approach: We performed a qualitative study with a grounded theory approach using individual semistructured interviews (December 2016–April 2017) of attending physicians who worked at inpatient and emergency department clinical sites from which residents departed to attend AHD. We used the constant comparative method, generating codes using an iterative approach and continuing sampling until saturation was reached. Major themes were identified and disagreements were resolved by consensus. Findings: Fifteen attending physicians from 6 clinical services were interviewed. Data analysis yielded 5 themes: emotional strain of workload, technology and systems challenges, patient safety and care concerns, disrupted resident learning, and the challenge to optimize resident education. Attending physicians, already working on busy services, felt frustrated and perceived having an increased workload when residents departed for AHD. They were concerned about safely entering orders in the electronic health record, impeded patient workflow, and further disruption of resident schedules already disrupted by duty hour restrictions and continuity clinic. Attending physicians described the importance of experiential learning from caring for patients and from structured didactic learning; however, the optimal balance was uncertain. Insights: We found that attending physicians experienced significant emotional strain, faced technological challenges, and were concerned about impeded workflow and patient safety when residents departed clinical sites for AHD. This is likely to be true whenever residents are pulled out of the clinical setting for any reason.

Despite calls for a robust, multifaceted approach to competency-based assessment (CBA), lingering critiques exist. These critiques include reductionism, reinforcement of an external locus of control within learners, an loss of focus on learner development. Both CBME and CBA may be strengthened if viewed through the lens of a complementary curriculum design framework that broadens the focus on the learner. Evidence: Researchers and physician organizations have articulated the need for medical practitioners trained to provide optimal care in the rapidly changing care environment. In the drive to ensure accountability to patients and society, CBME may overlook the duty of educators to foster the necessary intrinsic development of learners as holistic professionals. The focus of CBA on outcomes may reward memorization and rote performance but may fail to ensure the underlying comprehension or critical thinking necessary to adapt to the variability of real-life patient care. Learners focus on tasks chosen for assessment; thus, areas less easily assessed may be overlooked or deemed unimportant. Reinforcement for learner motivation becomes externalized in CBA, as opposed to being driven by the desire for self-improvement and self-actualization. A recently proposed framework that views learner development as a process-based improvement cycle, the “Master Adaptive Learner,” may help remedy this issue. L. Dee Fink’s Taxonomy of Significant Learning aims to create meaningful learning experiences in higher education. This taxonomy consists of six interwoven domains: (a) Learning How to Learn, (b) Foundational Knowledge, (c) Application, (d) Integration, (e) Human Dimension, and (f) Caring. Each domain encompasses a unique perspective on the learning process, and when collectively applied to curriculum design, significant learning occurs. This taxonomy has not been widely applied to medical education but may offer an important counterbalance to the outcomes-based focus of CBME. Implications: The outcomes-based focus of CBME is well suited for skill-based tasks, such as procedures, that are observable and measurable. However, other essential physician skills—such as critical thinking, reflection, empathy, and self-directed learning—are not easily assessed, and thus may receive little focus in an outcomes-based model. A holistic approach, such as the Taxonomy of Significant Learning, can counter the deficits of CBME and provide a balanced approach to education program design and assessment. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060906183"

Clerkship programs employ various call modalities, including traditional call, night float, and evening call. The impact of these call models on the student experience has not been explored in depth. Approach: Focus groups were conducted with 4th-year medical students, exploring their multidimensional experiences with various call modalities during clerkship. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings: Thirty-nine students participated in 6 focus groups. Four overarching themes were identified: (a) educational value conferred by clinical exposure and teaching, (b) maintaining quality of life and developing features of burnout, (c) formation of professional identity via relationships with team members, and (d) perceived quality of patient care provided. Students associated evening call with burnout and poor educational value but also better patient continuity of care. Night float and traditional call contributed to a sense of team bonding and had enhanced perceived educational value while on call but resulted in loss of formal academic teaching time. Insights: Call modality impacts student learning, well-being, professional identity formation, and patient care; however, trade-off among these elements exists across all call models. Enhancing the value of student call experience may be achieved by implementation of various purposeful changes. These may include creating consistency between student and resident call schedules, maximizing recovery time between call shifts, and avoiding scheduling of students for call prior to academic sessions. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053519850"

One strategy to help overcome disparities is preparing medical trainees to competently provide care for sexual and gender minority patients. The Association of American Medical Colleges has identified professional competencies that medical students should develop to meet sexual and gender minority health needs. However, challenges in the medical education environment may hinder the adoption and implementation of curricular interventions to foster these competencies. Intervention: Our medical education community engaged in curriculum evaluation and subsequently developed a sexual and gender minority topical sequence to promote student development of these competencies. This process was guided by explicit principles and curriculum development practices. Context: This work began at the Yale University School of Medicine in 2014, shortly after the Association of American Medical Colleges published sexual and gender minority health competencies and amidst the development and implementation of a new curriculum at the institution. Impact: We identified core principles and practices to guide the development of an integrated sexual and gender minority health sequence. This process resulted in successful creation of an integrated curricular sequence. At this time, 9 new or enhanced curricular components have been adopted through our process—5 in preclinical, 3 in the clinical, and 1 in the elective, curricula—in addition to the 13 preexisting components that have been updated as appropriate. Feedback about the process from students and faculty has been overwhelmingly positive. Evaluation of curricular components and their effectiveness as an integrated sequence is ongoing. Lessons Learned: Core principles consisted of including a wide range of stakeholders to build consensus, establishing complementary student and faculty roles, using the “language of collaboration” rather than the “language of demand,” presenting sexual and gender minority content in an intersectional manner whenever possible, and balancing sexual and gender minority components across the curriculum. Key practices included mapping curriculum to identify gaps; developing curriculum “pitches”; identifying early and potential later “adopters” among faculty; focusing on faculty ownership of curriculum to facilitate institutionalization; and performing ongoing tracking, assessment, and revision of curriculum. © 2018, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060342915"

Pimping occurs when a teacher (pimper) asks difficult questions of the learner (pimpee), usually in rapid succession. There is a paucity of literature formally studying this technique and its effects on teachers and learners. Our study examines the use of and attitudes toward pimping in a pathology residency program to better understand its perceived value and effectiveness. Approach: Using a qualitative approach, we conducted semistructured interviews with 8 pathology trainees and 9 pathologists. As part of the interview process, we asked participants to draw a rich picture of a pimping encounter. Consistent with this qualitative method, we analyzed data iteratively using constant comparison. Findings: Negative emotions including anxiety and self-doubt dominated among the learners during pimping encounters. For some, these resulted in motivation to study, and for others this was a futile, nonmotivating experience. Most trainees felt that they were being judged during pimping; however, they perceived that the intentions of pimping were not malicious and in their best interests. This was supported by pathologists, who stated that their motivation for pimping was to identify knowledge gaps, thus benefiting the trainee. Insights: Pimping created a dichotomy of emotions within the majority of learners in this study. Negative emotions occurred during pimping encounters; however, following the encounter, pimping was perceived in a more positive light. Recognizing when and how pimping can create negative emotions that may interfere with learning may enable educators to create more consistently meaningful interactions. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065781143"

Authorship order is an important consideration because it often used as an indicator of seniority, expertise, leadership, and scholarly productivity. As a result, authorship order factors into decisions about hiring, salary, resource allocation, and professional advancement. This study describes principles commonly applied to authorship order decisions within the medical education community and educators’ opinions about the significance of authorship order. Approach: A questionnaire was developed to ascertain current practices related to authorship decisions. Sixteen items were rated in terms of frequency of actual use and the desirability of the practice using a 4-point rating scale: 1 (never), 2 (sometimes), 3 (often), and 4 (always). Additional questions addressed the perceived significance of authorship order. The last set of questions provided information about respondents’ personal and career characteristics. The survey was delivered via e-mail to a random sample of 391 subscribers from the DR-ED listserv. Findings: Fifty-four e-mail addresses were returned as undeliverable; of the remaining 337 mailed surveys, 109 responses (32.3%) were received. Five of the current practices for determining authorship order were rated as both frequent and desirable; 4 items had low ratings suggesting that these practices were both infrequent and undesirable. For 7 items, there was a significant gap between the ratings of practice frequency and desirability. When asked about preferred authorship order strategies, most respondents (94%) endorsed listing authors by descending order based on contribution but were split in identifying the last author (47%) or second author (46%) as the next best placement after first author. Respondents supported the practice of many journals requiring authors to disclose their contributions, agreeing (69%) that it provides useful information for promotion and tenure committees; however, 43% were uncertain about how disclosed contributions were reflected in authorship order. Insights: Respondents strongly endorsed the importance of listing authors in order of decreasing contribution, although the meaning of second versus last author lacks consensus. This finding, together the other strategies that received strong endorsement and those that were not strongly endorsed, provides a starting point to develop guidance for medical educators about how to determine authorship order. Clear guidance for authors would promote fairness and accountability within the medical education community as well as provide more consistent interpretation for those who consider authorship order for career- and resource-related decisions. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058703768"

Although providing the learner with in-depth exposure to a specific discipline, educators have challenged this rotational model, citing problems with patient and team continuity and maladaptive coping. Longitudinal integrated clerkships, adopted by many medical schools, offer an alternative model and have demonstrated improved outcomes for students related to patient-centeredness, advocacy, and integration with teams. Despite this, longitudinal integrated training in residency is rare. Intervention: We developed a novel 3-month longitudinal integrated block for residents, called Keystone. The block combined 3 previously discrete, shorter rotations in developmental-behavioral pediatrics, advocacy, and emergency medicine into a longer and integrated experience. Within each week, the block utilized half-day sessions in the resident’s primary care clinic, a new continuity Developmental Behavioral Pediatrics clinic where the resident worked with the same faculty preceptor and interprofessional team each week, shifts in the emergency department, and half-day sessions dedicated to clinic- and community-based advocacy activities. Context: The context was a single, large pediatric urban residency program based at 2 university-affiliated hospitals, an academic freestanding children’s hospital, and academic safety net hospital. Outcome: Using a phenomenologic framework, we conducted interviews and a focus group discussion to explore residents’ attitudes about the block; their perceptions regarding the block’s impact on relationships with preceptors, peers, or patients; and the block’s impact on learning and practice. Fourteen residents participated, 10 in interviews and 4 in the focus group discussion. Six themes emerged from thematic analysis: (a) the longitudinal nature of Keystone influenced professional relationships and as a result entrustment, (b) the longitudinal integrated design shaped engagement and learning, (c) flexibility promoted work–life balance and self-directed learning, (d) learners experienced time and space for professional identity development, (e) Keystone provided a unique opportunity to reclaim patient-centeredness, and (f) learners experienced important advantages and challenges related to the schedule. Lessons Learned: The longitudinal integrated nature of Keystone provided a novel structure for addressing important yet challenging educational goals in residency, including enhancing relationships, facilitating entrustment and engagement, encouraging patient-centeredness, and emphasizing the importance of self-directed learning. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054882786"

Students acquire both technical knowledge and nontechnical attributes, which are necessary for success in further work and life. The early clinical learning experiences of medical students are primarily acquired through clerkships. These clerkships require medical students to apply and extend what they learned during their preclinical education; however, previous studies have explored this issue through examining fragmentary factors such as preclinical course grades and traits but not undertaking comprehensive, whole-person investigations. Hypotheses: To account for the potential benefits of a holistic approach in medical students’ learning, we propose three hypotheses: Medical students’ preclinical performance on Taiwan’s technical and nontechnical higher education assessments are positively associated with their clinical competence (Hypothesis 1) and psychological well-being (Hypothesis 2) during clerkships, and medical students’ psychological well-being during clerkships is positively associated with their clinical competence (Hypothesis 3). Method: We studied a cohort of 65 medical students engaged in clerkships from September 2013 to April 2015. Their preclinical technical knowledge scores—formal curricular grades received from course instructors—were obtained from their medical school’s archival dataset. Their nontechnical attributes—moral and social performance scores received from student mentors and physical performance scores received from course instructors—were also obtained from the school’s archival data set. The medical students’ competence in their 2-year clinical clerkships was measured using the objective structured clinical examination scores from the end of both clerkship years. The medical students’ psychological well-being during their 2-year clerkships was measured according to burnout level, which was determined using routine online surveys that employed validated, structured, and self-administered questionnaires at each specialty rotation. Multiple regressions and linear mixed-effects model were employed for statistical analysis. Results: Our study revealed that higher preclinical technical knowledge predicted superior clinical competence and a higher level of burnout during clerkships. By contrast, higher preclinical nontechnical attributes (i.e., higher preclinical moral, social, and physical performance) predicted lower level of burnout. However, no relationship was discovered between clerkship burnout and the clinical competence of the medical students. Conclusions: Our study verified the value of a holistic education that encompasses both technical knowledge and nontechnical attributes during the preclinical learning stage for medical students. Our findings can serve as a reference for medical educators designing preclinical educational programs for medical students. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058174362"

Recently, entrustment has been highlighted as an essential element of trainee–supervisor interactions. Despite the growing body of knowledge concerning entrustment in medical education, how supervisors conceptualize the oral case presentation as a contributor to entrustment decision making during clinical supervision remains unknown. Given their widespread use, oral case presentations may represent a potential tool for future frameworks of workplace-based assessment. This study sought to explore what factors influence supervisors’ expectations of oral case presentation content and how the oral case presentation may contribute to entrustment decision making. Approach: Using qualitative methodology, semistructured interviews were conducted from a purposive sample of attending emergency medicine physicians at an academic medical center from 2015 to 2016. Thematic analysis of the semistructured interview transcripts was conducted by 2 investigators using line-by-line coding and constant comparative analysis. Key themes were identified through consensus. Theoretical sampling occurred until thematic saturation was reached. Findings: Twenty-one attending physicians were interviewed. Four factors were found to influence supervisor expectations pertaining to oral case presentation content (trainee level, trainee familiarity, clinical context, and clinical task). Further, the oral case presentation was found to serve as a means of indirect observation and an entrustment check point informing future decisions relating to trainee supervision. Insights: The oral case presentation represents a core activity within the trainee–supervisor relationship in which entrustment plays a central role. Given the numerous factors influencing oral case presentation content, we caution supervisors against relying solely on the oral case presentation as an entrustment check point, as this may lead to inaccurate judgments of trainee competence.

Yet intact translation of pedagogies and practices devised in one cultural setting may not be possible or necessarily appropriate for alternate environments. Purposeful examination of workplace learning is necessary to understand how the source or “home” program may need adapting in the distributed or “host” setting. Background: Strategies to optimize cross-border medical education partnerships have been largely focused on elements of campus-based learning. Determining how host clinical supervisors approach assessment in experiential settings within a different culture and uphold the standards of home programs is relevant given the influence of context on trainees’ demonstrated competencies. In this mixed-methods study, we sought to explore assessor judgments of student workplace-based performance made by preceptors sharing a pharmacy curriculum in Canada and Qatar. Approach: Using modified Delphi consensus technique, we asked clinical supervisors in Canada (n = 18) and in Qatar (n = 14) to categorize trainee performance as described in 16 student vignettes. The proportion of ratings for three levels of expectation (exceeds, meets, or below) was calculated and within-country group consensus achieved if the level of agreement reached 80%. Between-country group comparisons were measured using a chi-square statistic. We then conducted follow-up semi-structured interviews to gain further perspectives and clarify assessor rationale. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Results: The threshold for between-country group differences in assessor impressions was met for only two of the 16 student vignettes. Compared to Canadian clinical supervisors, relatively more preceptors in Qatar judged one described student as meets rather than exceeds expectations and one as meets rather than falls below expectations. Analysis of follow-up interviews exploring how culture may inform variations in assessor judgments identified themes associated with the profession, organization, learner, and supervisor performance theories but not their particular geographic context. Clinical supervisors in both countries were largely aligned in expectations of student knowledge, skills, and behaviors demonstrated in patient care and multidisciplinary team interactions. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that variation in student assessment was more frequent among clinical supervisors within the same national context than any differences identified between the two countries. In these program settings, national sociocultural norms did not predict global assessor impressions or competency-specific judgments; instead, professional and organizational cultures were more likely to inform student characterizations of performance in workplace-based settings. Further study situated within the specific experiential learning contexts of cross-border health professional curricula is assuredly warranted. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076383462"

Interventions in residency programs have often addressed isolated contributors to burnout; however, a more comprehensive framework for conceptualizing wellness is needed. Evidence: In this article the authors propose Maslow's hierarchy of human needs (physiologic, safety, love/belonging, esteem, and self-actualization) as a potential framework for addressing wellness initiatives. There are numerous contributors to burnout among physician-trainees, and programs to combat burnout must be equally multifaceted. A holistic approach, considering both the trainees personal and professional needs, is recommended. Maslow's Needs can be adapted to create such a framework in graduate medical education. The authors review current evidence to support this model. Implications: This work surveys current interventions to mitigate burnout and organizes them into a scaffold that can be used by residency programs interested in a complete framework to supporting wellness. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046104629"

Although race/ethnicity has been found to be associated with clinical grades during medical school, it remains unclear whether other factors such as performance on standardized tests account for racial/ethnic differences in clinical grades. Identifying the root causes of grading disparities during the clinical phase of medical school is important because of its long-term impacts on the career advancement of students of color. Approach: To evaluate the association between race/ethnicity and clinical grading, we examined Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE) summary words (Outstanding, Excellent, Very Good, Good) and 3rd-year clerkship grades among medical students at the University of Washington School of Medicine. The analysis included data from July 2010 to June 2015. Medical students were categorized as White, underrepresented minorities (URM), and non-URM minorities. Associations between MSPE summary words and clerkship grades with race/ethnicity were assessed using ordinal logistic regression models. Findings: Students who identified as White or female, students who were younger in age, and students with higher United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 scores or final clerkship written exam scores consistently received higher final clerkship grades. Non-URM minority students were more likely than White students (Adjusted Odds Ratio = 0.53), confidence interval [0.36, 0.76], p =.001, to receive a lower category MSPE summary word in analyses adjusting for student demographics (age, gender, maternal education), year, and United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 scores. Similarly, in four of six required clerkships, grading disparities (p <.05) were found to favor White students over either URM or non-URM minority students. In all analyses, after accounting for all available confounding variables, grading disparities favored White students. Insights: This single institution study is among the first to document racial/ethnic disparities in MSPE summary words and clerkship grades while accounting for clinical clerkship final written examinations. A national focus on grading disparities in medical school is needed to understand the scope of this problem and to identify causes and possible remedies. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065177796"

Background: The MCTQ is an instrument first studied in medical and veterinary education; it was shown to produce valid and reliable data when evaluating how well preceptors engage in cognitive apprenticeship. Additional validity evidence, however, is needed to determine if the MCTQ is useful and applicable in other healthcare professions, such as pharmacy. Approach: Student pharmacists and pharmacy residents at a large academic medical center completed the MCTQ to evaluate pharmacist preceptors. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to determine how consistent the data were with the 5-factor structure of the cognitive apprenticeship teaching methods (e.g., modeling, coaching, articulation, exploration, and safe learning environment). A structural equation model (SEM) was used to evaluate the relationship between the 5 factors. Preceptor and student perceptions were also collected to evaluate the response process and potential consequences of using the instrument. Results: Thirty-eight learners (2nd-year and 4th-year student pharmacists and pharmacy residents) submitted 157 evaluations. The CFA showed appreciable fit with the 5-factor structure of the cognitive apprenticeship framework after 2 modifications (removal of 1 item and moving 1 item to a different factor). The SEM had poor model fit compared to previous studies, and an exploratory analysis suggests that there is a complex relationship between the various teaching methods. Preceptors and students highly agreed that the instrument was valuable for providing feedback. Conclusion: The MCTQ has additional validity evidence that supports it as a viable instrument to assess preceptor engagement in teaching methods consistent with the cognitive apprenticeship framework. Additional research is warranted to explore the relationship between components in the cognitive apprenticeship framework to determine how preceptors can best focus their efforts to improve clinical teaching. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065553506"

Background: The longevity of McMAP relative to other programmatic WBA systems affords a unique view that precedes large-scale transitions to competency-based medical education (CBME), particularly in North America. Although prior work has described the perspective of residents using this system, the in-depth experiences of assessors using the system have yet to be explored. This perspective is important for understanding the validity of the competency judgments the system produces. Approach: We conducted a qualitative study that used semi-structured interviews analyzed using interpretive description (Thorne) to explore 16 attending physicians’ experiences using McMAP. Data analysis was completed independently by 2 researchers, who met regularly to discuss codes and resolve any disagreements. Results: Having a structured assessment framework for a range of clinical tasks has helped encourage what attendings perceived to be more frequent and better-quality assessments, with the added advantages of being holistic, flexible, and learner-driven. However, attendings also perceived a number of challenges of McMAP and programmatic WBA more broadly. These included a reluctance to give and to document negative feedback, “gaming” of the system by both attendings and residents, and a variety of logistic and technology-related concerns. Conclusions: Based on our findings, we offer several key recommendations that can help programs maximize the benefits of programmatic WBA as they transition to CBME. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062508949"

We sought to understand how literacy promotion training is currently implemented in pediatric residency programs from the perspective of program directors. Approach: We conducted semistructured interviews with all 9 residency program directors in 1 state. We analyzed data iteratively coding transcripts using an immersion/crystallization approach to identify themes. Findings: We achieved saturation after 9 interviews with 11 participants. We identified 3 major themes: (a) Residency programs rely on an existing primary-care-based literacy promotion intervention (Reach Out and Read) and the resident continuity clinic for literacy promotion training; (b) program directors encourage early and repeated exposure to facilitate literacy promotion education; and (c) service obligations, content specifications, and pressure on faculty create competing time demands that function as key barriers to literacy promotion training. Insights: Residency program directors used an existing, widely used intervention and the infrastructure provided by continuity clinics to facilitate training on literacy promotion, a relatively new pediatric care standard.

Course evaluations reflected that students wanted more opportunities to practice multicultural communication skills whereas lecturers felt that students’ personal inquiry of cultural competence could be strengthened. This study explores whether the combination of self-directed pre-class learning and in-class activities through flipped learning could address these instructional issues. Three research questions were examined: (1) How did dietetic students’ perceived confidence in multicultural communication change before and after undergoing flipped learning? (2) Which aspects of cultural competence influenced students’ confidence in multicultural communication before and after flipped learning? (3) Which aspects of cultural competence were students’ cultural learning goals based upon after flipped learning? Intervention: The intervention began with an introductory lesson in which students attended a lecture on New Zealand’s cultural landscape, self-assessed their cultural influences, and completed self-directed learning of cultural competence concepts. After this, students participated in two flipped learning lessons; the first lesson focused on cultural knowledge and the second on multicultural communication skills. For both lessons, students completed preparatory activities before engaging in small-group activities during the class sessions. Before and after the flipped learning lessons, students wrote online reflections about the reasons underlying their confidence in multicultural communication. Context: The intervention was carried out with 32 early dietetic students who were in their first semester of postgraduate studies and 31 students consented to study participation. The majority of study participants were female (n = 30, 97%), European or Asian (n = 28, 91%), and between 21–30 years old (n = 27, 87%). Impact: Pre and post module surveys submitted by 31 students showed that more of them reported being confident or very confident in multicultural communication after flipped learning. Reflections submitted by 31 students before flipped learning showed that their confidence in multicultural communication was based upon their cultural knowledge and cultural interaction experiences. Reflections submitted by 19 students after flipped learning indicated that they developed cultural skill which helped them become confident in multicultural communication. These students set goals to continue developing their cultural knowledge, engaging in cultural interaction, and optimizing opportunities for applying cultural skill during clinical practice. Lessons learned: The study results showed that flipped learning can be used for cultural learning.

Having clinical empathy can improve interactions with dying, but educational interventions aimed at fostering empathy may cause medical students to connect emotionally with dying patients and behave unprofessionally out of self-defense. Cognitively-based clinical empathy should lead to positive attitudes toward death and dying by adhering to the principles of detached concern and professionalism. Hypotheses: The main components of cognitively-based clinical empathy are negatively correlated with (1) difficulty communicating with dying patients and their relatives, and (2) avoidance of death and dying. Method: This cross-sectional study included 372 medical students from two universities in Konya, Turkey. Data were collected via a survey consisting of three parts: socio-demographic information, the Turkish version of Jefferson Scale of Empathy-Student Version (JSE-S), and the Turkish Approach to Death and Dying Patients Attitude Scale. Independent samples t-test and one-way analysis of variance were used for comparative analysis. Bivariate and partial correlation analyses were used to assess the associations between variables. Results: Perspective-taking and compassionate care were significantly and moderately positively correlated with difficulty communicating with the dying and their relatives. Perspective-taking and compassionate care had significant, but weak positive correlations with avoiding death and dying. There was no significant correlation between standing in the patient’s shoes and either communication or avoidance. Conclusions: Both hypotheses were rejected. The present findings raise questions regarding whether the JSE-S is an effective operationalization of cognitively-based clinical empathy. Perspective-taking and compassionate care as measured by the JSE-S may reflect a propensity to engaging emotionally that leads to negative attitudes toward death and dying in medical students. If so, reducing the negative effects of emotional engagement seems crucial for developing positive attitudes toward death and dying in medical students. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089453880"

Intervention: We developed the Leadership and Discovery Program (LEAD) to facilitate scholarship among all non-research-track categorical internal medicine (IM) residents. This multifaceted program set expectations for all residents to participate in a scholarly project, supported faculty to manage the program, facilitated access to faculty mentors, established a local resident research day to highlight scholarship, and developed a didactic lecture series. Context: We implemented LEAD at a large university training program. We assessed resident scholarship before and after LEAD implementation using objective metrics of academic productivity (i.e., scientific presentations, peer-reviewed publications, and both presentations and publications). We compared these metrics in LEAD participants and a similar historical group of pre-LEAD controls. We also assessed these outcomes over the same two periods in research track residents who participated in research training independent from and predating LEAD (research track controls and pre-LEAD research track controls). We conducted focus groups to qualitatively assess resident experiences with LEAD. Outcome: Compared to 63 pre-LEAD controls, greater proportions of 52 LEAD participants completed scientific presentations (48.1% vs. 28.6%, p =.03) and scientific presentations and peer-reviewed publications (23.1% vs. 9.5%, p =.05). No significant differences existed for any academic productivity metrics among research track controls and pre-LEAD research track controls (p >.23, all comparisons). Perceived facilitators of participation in LEAD included residents’ desire for research experiences and opportunities to publish prior to fellowship training; the main barrier to participation was feeling overwhelmed due to the time constraints imposed by clinical training. Suggestions for improvement included establishing clearer programmatic expectations and providing lists of potential mentors and projects. Lessons Learned: Implementation of a multifaceted program to support scholarship during residency was associated with significant increases in academic productivity among IM residents. Residents perceived that programs to support scholarship during residency training should outline clear expectations and identify available mentors and projects for residents who are challenged by the time constraints of clinical training. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065530644"

Background: Surgical programs are adopting competency-based frameworks. The adoption of these frameworks for assessment requires tools that produce accurate and valid assessments of knowledge and technical performance. An assessment tool that is quick to complete could improve feasibility, reduce delays, and result in a higher volume of assessments of learners. Previous work demonstrated that the 9-item O-SCORE can produce valid results; the goal of this study was to determine if a single-item performance rating (Is candidate competent to independently complete procedure: yes or no) completed at a separate viewing would correlate to the O-SCORE, thus increasing feasibility of procedural competence assessment. Approach: Nineteen residents and 2 staff orthopedic surgeons from the University of Ottawa volunteered for a 2-part OSCE-style station including a written questionnaire and videotaped simulated open reduction and internal fixation midshaft radius fracture. Each performance was rated independently by 3 orthopedic surgeons using a single-item performance score (Time 1). The performances were assessed again 6 weeks later by the 3 raters using the O-SCORE (Time 2). Correlation between the single-item performance score and the O-SCORE were evaluated. Results: Three orthopedic surgeons completed 21 ratings each resulting in 63 orthopedic ratings. There was a high level of correlation and agreement between the single-item performance score at Time 1 and Time 2 (κ correlation =0.72–1.00; p <.001; percentage agreement =90%–100%). The reliability of the O-SCORE at Time 2 with three raters was 0.83 and the internal consistency was 0.89. There was a tendency for each rater to assign more yes responses to the more senior trainees. Conclusions: A single-item performance score correlated highly with the O-SCORE in an orthopedic setting. A single-item score could be used to supplement a multi-item score with similar results in orthopedics. There is still benefit in completing multi-item scores such as the O-SCORE evaluations to guide specific areas of improvement and direct feedback. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058089507"

Although previous studies have shown improved trainee self-efficacy and comfort in handling difficult conversations after formal communication training, it remains unclear whether these interventions lead to improved objectively assessed short-term and long-term performance. Intervention: A simulation-based intervention emphasizing the SPIKES protocol for delivery of bad news was implemented for 15 fellows in the 3-year Baylor College of Medicine Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine fellowship program in the 2013–2014 academic year. Simulations involved video-recorded encounters between each fellow and a standardized parent (SP) involving communication of difficult news. Each fellow was evaluated before (preintervention), immediately after (postintervention), and 3–4 months after the intervention (follow-up) with an (a) evaluation of video-recorded sessions by two expert raters blinded to the timing of the encounter (blinded rater evaluation [BRE]), (b) Self-Assessment Questionnaire, (c) Content Test evaluating knowledge of taught concepts, and (d) SP evaluation (SPE). Context: The 1st- and 2nd/3rd-year fellows participated in the study at separate times in the academic year to accommodate their schedules. First-year fellows had had more prior communication training and less NICU clinical experience than the 2nd/3rd-year fellows at the time of their intervention. Outcome: Although all fellows displayed improved Self-Assessment and Content Test scores at postintervention with retention at the follow-up assessment, the BREs showed no statistically significant improvement in postintervention scores and showed a decline in follow-up scores. First-year fellows had higher BRE postintervention scores than the senior fellows. SPEs showed no difference in scores at all 3 assessment stages. Lessons Learned: As previously described in the literature, trainee self-efficacy and knowledge may improve in the short term and long term with a simulation-based curriculum in communication of difficult news. However, these results may be inconsistent with those of objective evaluations by expert raters and standardized parents. The impact of the curriculum may be heightened if it reinforces previously learned skills, but the effect may wane over time if not reinforced frequently with additional formal training or in the clinical setting. The results of this study highlight the importance of objective assessments in evaluating the utility of a simulation-based communication curriculum and the need for longitudinal curricula to promote retention of the concepts and skills being taught. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057307422"

Medical providers in the intensive care unit often deal with difficult situations with strong emotions, life-and-death decisions, and both interpersonal and interprofessional conflicts. The effect of mindfulness meditation training on healthcare providers during acute care tasks such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation remains unknown. Mindfulness meditation has the potential to improve provider well-being and reduce stress in individuals involved in resuscitation teams, which could then translate into better team communication and delivery of care under stress. A better understanding of this process could lead to more effective training approaches, improved team performance, and better patient outcomes. Intervention: All participants were instructed to use a mindfulness meditation device (Muse™ headband) at home for 7 min twice a day or 14 min daily over the 4-week training period. This device uses brainwave sensors to monitor active versus relaxing brain activity and provides real-time feedback. Context: We conducted a single-group pretest–posttest convergent mixed-methods study. We enrolled 24 healthcare providers, comprising 4 interprofessional code teams, including physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, and pharmacists. Each team participated in a simulation session immediately before and after the mindfulness training period. Each session consisted of two simulated cardiopulmonary arrest scenarios. Both quantitative and qualitative outcomes were assessed. Outcome: The median proportion of participants who used the device as prescribed was 85%. Emotional balance, as measured by the critical positivity ratio, improved significantly from pretraining to posttraining (p =.02). Qualitative findings showed that mindfulness meditation changed how participants responded to work-related stress, including stress in real-code situations. Participants described the value of time for self-guided practice with feedback from the device, which then helped them develop individual approaches to meditation not reliant on the technology. Time measures during the simulated scenarios improved, specifically, time to epinephrine in Scenario 1 (p =.03) and time to defibrillation in Scenario 2 (p =.02), improved. In addition, team performance, such as teamwork (p =.04), task management (p =.01), and overall performance (p =.04), improved significantly after mindfulness meditation training. Physiologic stress (skin conductance) improved but did not reach statistical significance (p =.11). Lessons Learned: Mindfulness meditation practice may improve individual well-being and team function in high-stress clinical environments. Our results may represent a foundation to design larger confirmatory studies. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047129349"

However, in the 21st century, health is critically influenced by the interaction of biomedical conditions and nonbiomedical factors such as patient’s ability to manage chronic disease and the social determinants of health. Interventions to expand routine history taking to include nonbiomedical factors have not been widely adopted, possibly due to the difficultly of incorporating long checklists into routine care and the inability to achieve consensus on the relevant behavioral or social determinants of health content applicable to all patients. Intervention: In 2015–2016, we introduced medical students to a 6-domain (biomedical and psychiatric conditions, behavioral health, living environment/resources, social support, and functional status) approach to history taking and instructed them to elicit information from each domain alongside the traditional approach. Students were required to obtain information from each domain in one admitting history or one daily progress note, discuss their findings with the attending physician, and involve members of the medical team in addressing concerns and barriers in the care of that patient. Students’ history notes were reviewed for completeness and compared to those from a student control group. Students also completed a 10-question evaluation of the model. Context: The intervention was conducted during a 1-month rotation on a hospitalist general medicine service from May 2015 through August 2016. Outcome: Patient history and daily progress notes were collected from 38 fourth-year intervention students and compared to 24 control students on the same service from the previous year. Compared to control students, intervention students provided more patient information (p ≤.001) in all nonbiomedical domains except behavioral health. Intervention students reported that the 6-domain model helped them identify clinical information that could be addressed with existing resources and prompted involvement of social workers, pharmacists, and nurses in care planning. They also indicated the framework added clinically valuable information and enhanced team-based care. Lessons Learned: A domain-based framework can be used by medical students to identify clinically relevant behavioral conditions and social determinants of health tailored to individual patients while avoiding long standardized checklists. Arguably, routine collection of behavioral and social determinants of health is a necessary first step in enhancing physicians’ awareness and skills in working with health care teams to address nonbiomedical determinants of patients’ health. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053556206"

Data were coded for teamwork-related behaviors using a constant comparative approach combined with an identification of the valence of the coded statements as either “positive observation” or “suggestion for improvement.” Results: Eight codes related to teamwork emerged: attitude and demeanor, information facilitation, leadership, preparation and dependability, professionalism, team orientation, values team member contributions, and nonspecific teamwork comments. The frequency of codes and valence varied across the 3 performance groups, with students in the low-performing group receiving more suggestions for improvement across all teamwork codes. Conclusions: Narrative data from assessment portfolios included specific descriptions of teamwork behavior, with important contributions provided by both faculty and peers. A variety of teamwork domains were represented. Such feedback as collected in an assessment portfolio can be used for longitudinal assessment of preclerkship student teamwork skills and attitudes. © 2018, 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045461134"

Reflection is a critical step in the process of practice change among clinicians and may lead to improved outcomes following conference-based CME. However, reflection requires time to process newly-learned material. Adequate time for reflection may be noticeably absent during many conference presentations. Intervention: The pause procedure is a 90-second ‘pause’ during a 30-minute presentation so learners can review and discuss content. The goal of the pause procedure is to stimulate learners’ active engagement with newly learned material which will, in turn, promote learner reflection. Context: Fifty-six presentations at two hospital medicine CME conferences were assigned to the pause procedure or control. Study outcomes provided by conference participants were validated reflection scores and commitment-to-change (CTC) statements for each presentation. A post-hoc survey of the intervention group was conducted to assess presenters’ experiences with the pause procedure. Impact: A total of 527 conference participants completed presentation evaluations (response rate 72.7%). Presentations incorporating the pause procedure failed to lead higher participant reflection scores (percentage ‘top box’ score; intervention: 39.2% vs. control: 41.7%, p = 0.40) or participant CTC rates (median [IQR]; intervention: 4.64 [3.04, 10.57] vs. control: 8.16 [5.28, 17.12], p = 0.13) than control presentations. However, the majority of presenters (16 out of 17 survey respondents) had never before used the intervention and little active engagement among learners was noted during the pause procedure. Lessons Learned: Adding the pause procedure to CME presentations did not lead to greater reflection or CTC among clinician learners. However, presenters had limited experience with the intervention, which may have reduced their fidelity to the educational principles of the pause procedure. Faculty development may be necessary when planning a new educational intervention that is to be implemented by conference presenters. © 2020 Mayo Clinic.

Aligning student learning needs and faculty teaching approach could result in increased student understanding and skill development before a clerkship’s end. However, little is known about faculty perceptions of formative feedback from medical students and how faculty might respond to such feedback. Approach: In this qualitative study, semistructured interviews of 24 third-year clerkship faculty were conducted to explore faculty opinions about receiving formative feedback from students. Transcripts of these interviews were reviewed, and content analysis was performed. Findings: Faculty endorsed the idea of obtaining formative feedback from medical students. However, probing revealed factors that would significantly influence their receptivity and response to the feedback provided, including (a) who would be giving the feedback, (b) what content was included in the feedback, (c) how the feedback was framed, and (d) why the feedback was given. Although participants endorsed the concept of receiving formative feedback from medical students, their accounts of how they might respond to it presented a mixed picture of receptivity, acceptance, and response. Insights: These findings have practical implications. If formative feedback from medical students to faculty is to be encouraged, institutions need to find ways of creating a feedback culture in which more dialogic models become “the norm” and work with faculty to increase their receptivity to and acceptance of student feedback. This is essential for students to feel safe and be safe from retribution when providing insights into how faculty can better meet their learning needs. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073822613"

Our study addresses this gap by reporting on challenges and strategies around goal coconstruction as identified by clinical educators who were learning and attempting to implement a goal-oriented feedback approach in their own teaching contexts. Approach: We employed a qualitative, design-based research methodology to study how 5 clinician educators incorporated goal-oriented feedback into their teaching practice. Participants attended workshops on goal-oriented feedback and reflective writing. They then narratively reflected over a 6-month period on their attempts with goal-oriented feedback and shared these reflections in periodic facilitated group discussions. Themes were developed using iterative thematic analysis of group discussions and individual exit interviews. Findings: Participants identified several benefits of goal setting in all environments. They perceived improved rapport with learners and developed empathy for the vastness of learner goals. However, they experienced several struggles especially when learner and preceptor goals did not match. These included (a) how to address learner goals that were not easily amenable to a coconstruction, (b) how to coconstruct goals while actively running a clinical practice, and (c) how to remain learner centered while raising preceptor goals based on perceived gaps. Insights: Mismatches between learner and preceptor goals are inevitable and frequent. Preceptors must find ways to coconstruct goals with learners in various learning environments. That said, in enacting goal-oriented feedback, preceptors are effectively using feedback throughout the teaching and learning interaction to coconstruct the learning environment, resulting in improved rapport with learners and emphasizing why it is important to focus feedback around goals. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067640759"

Medical students can have difficulty identifying and caring for older patients with neurological difficulties, and often perceive neurology to be a challenging specialty. Medical education service-learning programming that engages community members and medical students, while fostering specialized neurology training, may help improve care for this patient population. Intervention: We developed the Parkinson’s Disease Buddy Program for first year medical students (M1s), which involved pairing students with patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) to engage in a social relationship. Students attended monthly seminars covering a range of topics specific to PD patient care and met with their PD buddies throughout the year. A mixed-methods approach was used to evaluate the program and involved pre/post assessments, as well as focus groups with both students and patients. Context: The University of Louisville’s School of Medicine and College of Education implemented this volunteer service-learning program for students by partnering with a locally based nonprofit, dedicated to serving PD patients. A total of 70 (35 M1s and 35 PD patients) participated. Outcome: Students’ total correct PD knowledge scores significantly increased after participation with a large effect size (pre-test mean = 14.77, [SD = 2.57]; post-test mean = 19.69 [SD = 2.06], Cohen’s d = 1.64) and a paired t-test indicated a significant change in students’ Parkinson’s Attitude Scale scores (t (34) = 2.22, p <.05). Ninety-one percent of students (31) indicated they would recommend the program and 82% (29) indicated they would participate again. During focus groups, students reflected on the relationships they formed with their buddies, indicating the program provided a support system while helping them learn about PD. Patients indicated the program expanded their social circle and meetings with M1s were beneficial. Lessons Learned: An experiential learning opportunity can help medical students become better acquainted with patients living with a neurological disease. We identified an impact on PD patients’ self-efficacy and social behavior that was not originally expected. We learned the importance of incorporating active learning modalities such as PD buddy panels and peer-to peer group discussions. The resources required to implement programs like ours can be lightened by engaging with local community partners and collaborating within and outside departments. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062819590"

Mistreatment can be embedded and normalized in hierarchical healthcare workplaces, limiting the effectiveness of policies and reporting tools to generate change; as a result, some of those who experience mistreatment later perpetuate it. We used a novel, creative approach, verbatim theater, to highlight the complexity of healthcare workplaces, encourage critical reflection, and support long-term culture change. Intervention: Verbatim theater is a theater-for-change documentary genre in which a playscript is devised using only the words spoken by informants. In 2017, 30 healthcare students and health professionals were recruited and interviewed about their experience of work and training by the multidisciplinary Sydney Arts and Health Collective using semi-structured interviews. Interview transcripts became the primary material from which the script for the verbatim theater play ‘Grace Under Pressure’ was developed. The performing arts have previously been used to develop the communication skills of health professional students; this esthetic expression of the real-life effects of healthcare workplace culture on trainees and students was implemented to stimulate consciousness of, and dialogue about, workplace mistreatment in healthcare work and training. Context: The play premiered at a major Sydney theater in October 2017, attended by the lay public and student and practicing health professionals. In November 2017, three focus groups were held with a sample of audience members comprising healthcare professionals and students. These focus groups explored the impact of the play on reflection and discussion of healthcare culture and/or promoting culture change in the health workplace. We analyzed the focus group data using theoretical thematic analysis, informed by Turner’s theory of the relation between ‘social’ and ‘esthetic’ drama to understand the impact of the play on its audience. Impact: Focus group members recognized aspects of their personal experience of professionalism, training, and workplace culture in the play, Grace Under Pressure. They reported that the play’s use of real-life stories and authentic language facilitated their critical reflection. Participants constructed some learning as ‘revelation,’ in which the play enabled them to gain significant new insight into the culture of health care and opened up discussions with colleagues. As a result, participants suggested possible remedies for unhealthy aspects of the culture, including systemic issues of bullying and harassment. A small number of participants critiqued aspects of the play they believed did not adequately reflect their experience, with some believing that the play over-emphasized workplace mistreatment. Lessons Learned: Verbatim theater is a potent method for making personal experiences of healthcare workplace and training culture more visible to lay and health professional audiences. In line with Turner’s theory, the play’s use of real-life stories and authentic language enabled recognition of systemic challenges in healthcare workplaces by training and practicing health professionals in the audience. Verbatim theater provides a means to promote awareness and discussion of difficult social issues and potential means of addressing them. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087058877"

Even fewer of those applicants are female, leading to a gender disparity among M.D.-Ph.D. trainees. We used a qualitative approach to understand why students choose not to apply or matriculate to M.D.-Ph.D. programs. Approach: We recruited recently matriculated medical students at a private research university with a self-reported interest in academic medicine and biomedical research to participate in focus groups, in which students discussed their career and life goals, general knowledge and sources of information for M.D.-Ph.D. programs, perceived benefits and downsides, and barriers to applying to such programs. Findings: Twenty-two students participated in focus groups. Participants desired careers combining clinical work, research, and teaching. Students had knowledge of the structure and goals of M.D.-Ph.D. training and received information about dual-degree programs from research mentors, the Internet, and peers. Tuition remission and increased grant access were cited as benefits of M.D.-Ph.D. programs, whereas duration, perceived excessive research training, and early commitment were downsides. Perceived competitiveness, misconceptions about training, a lack of M.D.-Ph.D. program-specific advising, discouragement from applying, and duration of training all served as barriers preventing students from pursuing dual-degree training. Insights: Through this qualitative study, we identified perceptions and misconceptions that recent medical school applicants have about M.D.-Ph.D. programs. These findings suggest targetable barriers to increase applications from interested students, such as improving awareness of programs, increased accessibility of advising and resources, and addressing concerns over training length, with the goal of improving training access for aspiring physician-scientists. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064539248"

Ageism adversely affects willingness to consider a career in geriatric medicine. However, few studies have examined this topic among Chinese medical students. This study aimed to investigate attitudes toward older people among medical students in China, examine the factors related to these attitudes, and determine the relationships between attitudes and willingness to consider geriatric medicine as a career after graduation. Approach: Responses from 1,022 Chinese medical students were included in the analyses. Students provided demographic information and completed the Fraboni Scale of Ageism (FSA). The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 24.0 (IBM SPSS Corp). Findings: The mean score of the FSA was 64.42 ± 6.58. Multiple regression analysis showed that the significant predictors of ageism were being male, longer years of training in medical school, and no caregiving experiences with older adults during clinical practice (R 2 =.038, F = 13.520, p <.001). Students who had higher FSA scores were more unwilling to consider a career in geriatric medicine after graduation (t = 4.281, p <.001, Cohen’s d =.268). Insights: Chinese medical students have fewer positive attitudes toward older adults than what has been reported in other countries. Future studies should examine the determinants of ageism among medical students in various cultures to guide the development, implementation, and assessment of interventions designed to nurture a more positive attitude toward older adults and increase willingness to consider a career in geriatric medicine. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087759427"

Many residency programs have implemented academic tracks to support career development in these areas. With the exception of research tracks, these tracks generally do not include significant longitudinal protected time and often rely upon ‘extra-curricular’ effort and possess insufficient structure, mentorship, and accountability. Most prior studies of non-research scholarship tracks have not been theory driven and do not explore in depth the experience of residents who participate. Approach: To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a qualitative case study informed by Social Cognitive Career Theory to explore the professional identity development of residents who participated in a non-research scholarship track that incorporates recommended best practices. The track, Pathways to Expertise Program, incorporates features of successful research tracks: protected time, longitudinal experience, mentorship, platforms for recognition, and accountability. Participants from the first three cohorts were interviewed at the time of their graduation (2017–2019). Semi-structured interviews were conducted, transcribed, and independently coded. Social Cognitive Career Theory informed the organization of codes into themes. Context: The Pathways to Expertise Program was implemented in a psychiatry residency training program in a large urban academic teaching hospital. Impact: Fifteen residents entered Pathways to Expertise Program during the study period and all 15 participated in the study. Fourteen completed the program and presented their projects at the department grand rounds. For dissemination, 12 presented their project findings at one or more national meetings in the form of a poster (20 distributed across 11 residents), workshop (six distributed across four residents), or presentation (two across two residents). Six residents accounted for a total of seven first author publications in peer reviewed journals. All participants described how their self-efficacy increased as a result of new skills (e.g., content, methodology, and scientific communication), mentorship (e.g., content and process guidance), peer and broader support (e.g., small group supervision), persuasive communications (e.g., recognition both locally and nationally), and positive emotional reactions (e.g., triumph). The residents also described expecting compelling benefits (e.g., stronger application for fellowship and expanded career opportunities). Participants indicated that the experience influenced their career goals and how they perceived their professional identities. Lessons Learned: These findings suggest that a longitudinal academic track that incorporates features of successful research tracks (protected time, mentorship, peer support, and accountability for deliverables) can be instrumental in forming and maturing professional identities for non-clinical roles. These tracks can accomplish several important goals, including enhancing resilience via identity formation around passion and purpose and meeting society’s need for physicians who are engaged in inquiry and innovation. Implications for the design of academic tracks in general are explored. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084985334"

Many of these physicians use an examination product to help them prepare, such as e-Learning products, including the ACP’s MKSAP, UpToDate, and NEJM Knowledge+, yet their effectiveness remains largely unstudied. Approach: We compared ABIM IM-MOC examination performance among 177 physicians who attempted an ABIM IM-MOC examination between 2014-2017 and completed at least 75% of the NEJM Knowledge+ product prior to the ABIM IM-MOC examination and 177 very similar matched control physicians who did not use NEJM Knowledge+. Our measures of ABIM IM-MOC exam performance for NEJM Knowledge+ users were based on the results of the first attempt immediately following the NEJM Knowledge+ use and for non-users were based on the applicable matched examination performance. The three dichotomous examination performance outcomes measured on the first attempt at the ABIM IM-MOC examination included pass rate, scoring in the upper quartile, and scoring in the lower quartile. Findings: Use of NEJM Knowledge+ was associated with a regression adjusted 10.6% (5.37% to 15.8%) greater likelihood of passing the MOC examination (p <.001), 10.7% (2.61% to 18.7%) greater likelihood of having an examination score in the top quartile (p =.009), and −10.8% (–16.8% to −4.86%) lower likelihood of being in the bottom quartile of the MOC examination (p <.001) as compared to similar physicians who did not use NEJM Knowledge+. Insight: Physicians who used NEJM Knowledge+ had better ABIM IM-MOC exam performance. Further research is needed to determine what aspects of e-Learning products best prepare physicians for MOC examinations. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090935268"

The purpose of this scoping review was to map the published literature regarding the final year to discern how medical schools have responded to this paradigm change. Approach: A structured 5-step approach was used to conduct this scoping review. Electronic searches of PubMed, ERIC, Scopus, MedEdPortal, and 8 medical education journals were conducted to identify relevant articles published from 2006 to 2016. Four authors screened articles for inclusion using standardized eligibility criteria; interrater agreement was discussed and calculated. Authors extracted data elements, and a consensus-based approach was used to categorize, sort, and structure information gathered. Findings: Among 6,485 articles retrieved, 817 articles were included in the study. From 2007–2011 to 2012–2016, articles addressing the final year of medical school increased 93%, whereas articles describing internship preparatory courses increased 218%. The majority of articles did not reference a CBME framework (572/817; 70%), the frequency of mentions increased 268% from 2007–2011 to 2012–2016. Nearly three fourths of preparatory course-related papers reference a CBME framework (37/50; 74%). Insights: Our findings may reflect a movement in U.S. medical schools toward using shared assessment metrics to support 4th-year medical students’ preparation for their postgraduate medical education. Despite an increased reference to CBME, there is relatively little use of competency-based assessment frameworks to evaluate learning outcomes. This review also found a substantial increase in the frequency of articles referencing senior-year preparatory courses in U.S. medical schools. Articles tended to describe institution-specific research or experiences. Opportunities likely exist for multi-institutional and organizational collaboration in determining the structure of the final year of medical school. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067578555"

Background: There is a consensus regarding the importance of assessing professionalism and interpersonal and communication skills in medical students, residents, and practicing physicians. Nonetheless, these noncognitive competencies are not well measured during medical education selection processes. One promising method for measuring these noncognitive competencies is the SJT. In a typical SJT, respondents are presented with written or video-based scenarios and asked to make choices from a set of alternative courses of action. Interpersonally oriented SJTs are commonly used for selection to medical schools in the United Kingdom and Belgium and for postgraduate selection of trainees to medical practice in Belgium, Singapore, Canada, and Australia. However, despite international evidence suggesting that SJTs are useful predictors of in-training performance, end-of-training performance, supervisory ratings of performance, and clinical skills licensing objective structured clinical examinations, the use of interpersonally oriented SJTs in residency settings in the United States has been infrequently investigated. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether residents’ performance on an SJT designed to measure professionalism-related competencies—conscientiousness, integrity, accountability, aspiring to excellence, teamwork, stress tolerance, and patient-centered care—predicts both their current and future performance as residents on two important but conceptually distinct criteria: ACGME competencies and the MPA. Approach: We developed an SJT to measure seven dimensions of professionalism. During calendar year 2017, 21 residency programs from 2 institutions administered the SJT. We conducted analyses to determine the validity of SJT and USMLE scores in predicting milestone performance in ACGME core competency domains and the MPA in June 2017 and 3 months later in September 2017 for the MPA and 1 year later, in June 2018, for ACGME domains. Results: At both periods, the SJT score predicted overall ACGME milestone performance (r =.13 and.17, respectively; p <.05) and MPA performance (r =.19 and.21, respectively; p <.05). In addition, the SJT predicted ACGME patient care, systems-based practice, practice-based learning and improvement, interpersonal and communication skills, and professionalism competencies (r =.16,.15,.15,.17, and.16, respectively; p <.05) 1 year later. The SJT score contributed incremental validity over USMLE scores in predicting overall ACGME milestone performance (ΔR =.07) 1 year later and MPA performance (ΔR =.05) 3 months later. Conclusions: SJTs show promise as a method for assessing noncognitive attributes in residency program applicants. The SJT’s incremental validity to the USMLE series in this study underscores the importance of moving beyond these standardized tests to a more holistic review of candidates that includes both cognitive and noncognitive measures. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085478409"

In the academic health center, junior faculty may be at particular risk for burnout given intersecting responsibilities of clinical expertise, research rigor, teaching commitments, and service expectations. To date, much of the focus on preventing and mitigating burnout has been located at the individual level, addressing lifestyle modification and self-regulation skills. We sought to examine relationships between institutional context and burnout qualities as a means to identify opportunities for organizational leadership to address faculty burnout. Approach: Data are from a baseline survey of assistant professors (faculty with diverse ratios for clinical, research, and teaching responsibilities) located within a pediatrics department in an academic medical center. Pearson correlation coefficients and logistic regression models were used to examine relationships between institutional factors (mentorship, collaboration opportunities, feelings of empowerment, value, and support of well-being) and experiences of burnout as measured by the original 22-item Maslach Burnout Inventory (subscales: Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, and Low Personal Accomplishment). Findings: Three perceived institutional characteristics were significantly associated with all three dimensions of burnout, particularly emotional exhaustion, which decreased with increasing perception of (a) empowerment to communicate professional needs, (b) feeling valued for contributions to the department, and (c) department commitment to support faculty well-being. In multivariate logistic regression models, adjusted for gender identity and years since training, increased positive perceptions of these three institutional characteristics were associated with significantly lower odds of burnout. For example, for each unit increase along a 5-point rating scale in feeling empowered to communicate needs and feeling valued for contributions to the department, the odds of meeting cutoff scores for burnout were reduced by 78% (p =.002) to 84% (p =.002), respectively. Insights: Although much of the focus on addressing burnout in healthcare settings has been on promoting coping skills and building resilience at the individual level, our findings add to a growing literature documenting a significant role for institutional leadership in identifying and facilitating strategies to promote faculty well-being. Findings also support leadership’s role for improving institutional climate via creating opportunities to increase faculty perceptions of empowerment and value in the department. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076383644"

Unfortunately, they are often not taught this skill as part of their healthcare education. Although many healthcare educators agree that this topic needs to be taught to students, researchers have not presented a formalized pathway to support this type of instruction. Evidence: Research on e-professionalism, a concept that addresses an individual’s online professional image, was originally presented in 2009 and has continued to be investigated with research supporting its importance. Scholars in the field have found that the cost of having a nonexistent or poor online reputation can cause a lack of trust in the patient–provider relationship and, in extreme situations, can cause healthcare providers to face criminal charges, lose their jobs, or be expelled from healthcare programs. For example, in 2014 an emergency room nurse posted a photo to Instagram of an empty trauma room and was fired from her position for what the hospital called “insensitivity.” These types of social media posts have occurred consistently over the last decade, highlighting the need for formalized online professionalism instruction in healthcare education. Implications: This article suggests the use of the extended parallel process model as a guide for healthcare educators to use when creating instruction on issues related to e-professionalism and online reputation management. The extended parallel process model has been successfully used to create health campaigns since the 1970s and is a respected and frequently used health communication model. This article shows that the extended parallel process model supports a systematic approach to e-professionalism instruction that allows it to be easily integrated into existing healthcare curricula. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058090101"

The ECHO model is utilized to expand access to care of common and complex diseases by supporting the education of primary care providers with an interprofessional team of specialists via videoconferencing networks. Intervention: Mock ECHO trainings are conducted through a train the trainer model targeted at leaders replicating the ECHO model at their organizations. Trainers conduct simulated teleECHO clinics while participants gain skills to improve communication and self-efficacy. Context: Three focus groups, conducted between May 2015 and January 2016 with a total of 26 participants, were deductively analyzed to identify common themes related to simulation-based medical education and interdisciplinary education. Principal themes generated from the analysis included (a) the role of empathy in community development, (b) the value of training tools as guides for learning, (c) Mock ECHO design components to optimize learning, (d) the role of interdisciplinary education to build community and improve care delivery, (e) improving care integration through collaboration, and (f) development of soft skills to facilitate learning. Outcome: Mock ECHO trainings offer clinicians the freedom to learn in a noncritical environment while emphasizing real-time multidirectional feedback and encouraging knowledge and skill transfer. Lessons Learned: The success of the ECHO model depends on training interprofessional healthcare providers in behaviors needed to lead a teleECHO clinic and to collaborate in the educational process. While building a community of practice, Mock ECHO provides a safe opportunity for a diverse group of clinician experts to practice learned skills and receive feedback from coparticipants and facilitators. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045429071"

Background: Team Based Learning (TBL) is an increasingly popular small group instructional strategy in health science education. TBL facilitation skills are unique and differ from those needed to lecture or facilitate other types of small groups. Measuring facilitation skills and providing feedback to TBL instructors is important, yet to date no valid instrument has been developed and published for this purpose. Approach: We created an 11-item instrument (ratings of each item on a 7-point scale) designed to assess TBL facilitation skills, considering major sources of validity. Twelve experts in TBL facilitation and training developed the content of the FIT. To ensure response processes were valid, we used an immediate retrospective probing technique with 4th year medical students who were not part of the study. The Facilitator Instrument for Team-Based Learning (FIT) was piloted with 2,840 medical students in 7 schools in large (year 1 and 2) and small (year 3) courses. The internal structure of the FIT was analyzed. Results: In total, 1,559 and 1,281 medical students in large and small TBL classes, respectively (response rate 88%) rated 33 TBL facilitators. The composite mean score for the FIT was 6.19 (SD = 1.10). Exploratory factor analysis and Cronbach’s alpha indicated that all items loaded on 1 factor, accounting for 77% of the item variance. Cronbach’s alpha for the 11 items was 0.97. Analysis of facilitator variables and course context indicated that FIT scores were statistically significantly correlated with type of class (pre-clinical or clinical) and size of class as well as the facilitator enjoyment in using TBL as a method. Gender and the amount that facilitators used TBL each year was weakly correlated, with other factors not correlated (years facilitating TBL, confidence in facilitating TBL, and age). Conclusions: Analysis of FIT scores from 2,840 medical students across multiple institutions and teaching settings suggests the utility of the FIT in determining the quality of TBL facilitation across a range of medical education settings. Future research is needed to further analyze course contexts and facilitator variables that may influence FIT scores with additional facilitators. Additionally, FIT scores should be correlated with additional measures of TBL facilitator quality, such as direct observations, especially if these data are used for summative decision-making purposes. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070516826"

Evidence: The literature suggests that institutional culture does not support trainee observation, and faculty perceive that they have limited time to observe trainees in an efficient and effective manner. These factors contribute to an inadequate number of trainee observations, limiting faculty ability to assess trainees’ achievement of competency. Hiring more faculty to increase observations has not been feasible or a priority, nor have faculty development programs been universally effective in recruiting faculty to enhance observations. Implications: To alleviate this important problem, the author proposes recruiting senior clinician educators transitioning to retirement. These are faculty who in their full-time careers have established themselves as playing a major role in teaching and might be interested in continuing their relationship with the academic health center. The number of these physicians is increasing and therefore there will be a larger pool seeking an opportunity to continue their commitment to education. Recruitment of senior clinician educators transitioning to retirement could significantly increase the number and quality of resident observations, addressing a previously insoluble problem with a relatively significant return on investment to the academic health center. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089870510"

Past research on the use of vSPs has not clearly established whether learners have different emotional responses to real SPs (rSPs) compared with vSPs; however, understanding learners’ emotional responses to vSPs is important in providing realistic learning experiences and establishing the validity of this teaching and assessment tool. This study compared the emotional experiences of individuals who interacted with rSPs and vSPs. Approach: Sixty medical students at a medical school in the southeastern United States participated in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to deliver bad news to an rSP or vSP. The vSP for this study used a hybrid intelligence model that allowed a person to “inhabit” the vSP. Salivary cortisol and a self-report measure of mood—the Profile of Mood States, Second Edition (POMS 2)—were gathered before and after delivering the bad news. The SP and 2 independent evaluators rated the behavioral performance of each participant in real and virtual conditions. Participants also rated the performance of the SP. Findings: Participants in both conditions reported increased negative emotionality on the POMS 2 following the SP interaction. There were no significant between-group differences on the POMS 2 or salivary cortisol concentration following the SP interaction. Ratings by the SP and independent evaluators indicated that participants performed similarly on most interpersonal dimensions, except tone of voice. Participants perceived the vSP as less realistic than the rSP. Insights: These results suggest that medical students may have similar emotional and behavioral responses when delivering bad news to a vSP when compared to an rSP. These findings provide support for the continued use of vSPs in training learners to deliver bad news and other communication-based skills and to assess their performance on these tasks. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071020028"

Sleep deprivation, which has been studied extensively, is only one contributor to fatigue. Given the complexity of fatigue and its relationship with resident performance, the National Steering Committee on Resident Duty Hours in Canada recommends that all residency education programs develop a fatigue risk management plan (FRMP) for their residents. The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of residents’ experiences of fatigue and the strategies they use to manage it. Approach: This single-site study investigated the perceptions of resident physicians. Residents were recruited through purposive sampling to ensure representation from a variety of programs, postgraduate year level, and gender. Recruitment was managed with support from the residency programs; however, data collection and analysis were conducted by the Office of Postgraduate Medical Education to ensure participant anonymity. Program directors and administrators assisted in relaying the information about the study to the residents; however, they were not made aware if their residents participated in the study. Interview and focus group data were collected all at once, then transcribed, and then subsequent thematic analysis of these data was conducted using a quasi-constant comparison approach until thematic saturation was reached. Two researchers coded the data using thematic content analysis. Findings: Fifty-seven residents participated in a focus group or interview. There was representation from more than half of the 58 residency programs and from 15 of 16 departments. Overall, there was consensus that fatigue impacts residents’ physical, cognitive, and emotional states. These impacts were reported as influencing resident performance including those related to patient care. Residents reported that fatigue led them to be less productive in their personal and professional lives. Three major themes were identified for which strategies could be developed for fatigue risk management: self, program, and system. Together with self-, program-, and system-level strategies that complement and enhance each other, specific targeted FRMPs could be developed. Insights: Fatigue is a multifaceted phenomenon experienced by residents that requires management beyond extended duty hours and adequate amounts of sleep. FRMPs that encompass strategies used by the resident, the residency-training program, and the healthcare system in which they work could assist with managing fatigue in residents and support enhanced resident well-being and patient care. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063998165"

However, little is known about how ownership is best defined and measured or about its value to trainees. The authors aimed to define ownership and elucidate the significance of developing ownership skills over the course of pediatric residency training. Approach: Focus groups and phone interviews were held with pediatric residency program directors (N = 18) and pediatric residents (N = 14). Focus groups and interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and qualitatively analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings: Program directors and residents characterized ownership as essential to good patient care. Ownership was defined as including personal responsibility, a connection to patients/families, and follow-up and follow-through. For many, ownership was most conspicuous in its absence. Respondents found meaning in their work when exerting ownership and lack of ownership was linked to burnout and frustration. Ownership was recognized as a critical skill that requires development during training to form a professional identity, avoid burnout, become an independent practitioner and function as an integral member of medical teams. Insights: Pediatric residents and faculty considered ownership a cornerstone of patient care and critical to forming a professional identity. The defining characteristics of patient care ownership—personal responsibility, connections with patients and families, and continuity of care—can be used to develop an instrument to assess trainee development of ownership. These findings reinforce the value of ownership in graduate medical education and support creating curricular interventions to foster ownership. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060995174"

However, traditional patient wards are centered around patient care and not so much around education. Other barriers such as time constraints also contribute to suboptimal interprofessional and multidisciplinary learning. Intervention: Six formal and informal learning activities that aimed at stimulation of interprofessional and multidisciplinary learning were designed and introduced in our patient ward to enable optimal integration of clinical practice and learning. Context: The study took place in an internal medicine inpatient ward where daily patient care is performed by specialized teams consisting of different healthcare professionals from the departments of Endocrinology, Nephrology, and Infectious Diseases. In the traditional ward setting, interprofessional and multidisciplinary learning mostly takes place during shared clinical activities. In this article, we describe the development and implementation of a Clinical Teaching Unit to support learning between different healthcare professionals. Impact: The intervention was evaluated with an online questionnaire among 108 nurses, student nurses, clerks, residents, supervising clinicians, and managers. Open-ended questions (response rate 65%) were used to determine the changes in the workplace experienced by the participants since the introduction of the Clinical Teaching Unit and what influenced their learning process and motivation to learn. Closed questions (response rate 46%) aimed to measure the effect of our intervention on collaboration, learning, and the quality of care and education. The results of the open-ended questions showed that participants experienced more interprofessional collaboration and learning. This took place in a less hierarchical, safer work climate which also resulted in perceptions of a better quality of patient care and education. The closed-ended questions showed that the intervention resulted in perceptions of improved collaboration, work culture, quality of care, education, and learning conditions. Lessons Learned: The findings imply that implementation of a Clinical Teaching Unit not only facilitates the integration of patient care and education but also the integration of different professions working together. From the intervention, we also learned that a successful Clinical Teaching Unit requires investment of time and staff, clear communication between healthcare professionals, and dedication of teachers within all professions. © 2020 The Author(s).

Approach: We sampled 1,032 areas of strength (strength) and areas for improvement (improvement) written evaluation comments by 423 physician assessors for clerkship students’ performance in academic years 2014–15 and 2015–16 at the University of Utah School of Medicine. Two researchers independently categorized each comment by EPA and/or coded by non-EPA topic. The proportion of comment types was compared between strength comments and improvement comments with the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Findings: The most frequently mentioned EPAs in comments were about history gathering/physical exam, differential diagnosis, documentation, presentation, and interprofessional collaboration; few mentioned diagnostic tests, patient handovers, recognition of urgent patient care, and patient safety, and none mentioned orders/prescriptions and informed consent. The most frequent non-EPA topics were about medical knowledge, need to read more, learning attitude, work ethic, professionalism/maturity, and receptiveness to feedback. The proportion of comments aligned with an EPA only, a non-EPA topic only, or both an EPA and non-EPA topic was significantly different for clerkship students’ strength compared to improvement. Insights: Physician assessors’ performance schemas for clerkship students were aligned with EPAs to varying degrees depending on the specific EPA and whether describing strength or improvement. Of interest, the frequently mentioned non-EPA comments represented some of the competencies that contribute to effectively performing particular EPAs and are Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) core competencies (e.g., medical knowledge, professionalism), used in residency programs. Because physician assessors for undergraduate medical education often also participate in graduate medical education, the frequency of non-EPA topics aligned to ACGME competencies may suggest influence of graduate medical education evaluative frameworks on performance schemas for clerkship students; this could be important when considering implementation of EPAs in undergraduate medical education. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069962874"

When used for learner assessment, they serve as gateways to increased responsibility and autonomy. It follows that identifying and describing EPAs is a high-stakes form of work analysis aiming to describe the core work of a profession. However, hasty creation and adoption of EPAs without rigorous attention to content threatens the quality of judgments subsequently made from using EPA-based assessment tools. There is a clear need for approaches to identify validity evidence for EPAs themselves prior to their deployment in workplace-based assessment. Evidence: For EPAs to realize their potential in health professions education, they must first be constructed to reflect accurately the work of that profession or specialty. If the EPAs fail to do so, they cannot predict a graduate’s readiness for or future performance in professional practice. Evaluating the methods used for identification, description, and adoption of EPAs through a construct validity lens helps give leaders and stakeholders of EPA development confidence that the EPAs constructed are, in fact, an accurate representation of the profession’s work. Implications: Application of a construct validity lens to EPA development impacts all five commonly followed steps in EPA development: selection of experts; identification of candidate EPAs; iterative revisions; evaluation of proposed EPAs; and formal adoption of EPAs into curricula. It allows curricular developers to avoid pitfalls, bias, and common mistakes. Further, construct validity evidence for EPA development provides assurance that the EPAs adopted are appropriate for use in workplace-based assessment and entrustment decision-making. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087744272"

We explored how clerks understand their roles as both medical learners and developing professionals and some of the tensionss that arise therein. Understanding how the clinical learning environment shapes the clerkship role can help educators foster compassionate care. Approach: We conducted 5 focus groups and 1 interview with 3rd-year medical students (n = 14) at University of Toronto between January and June 2016 regarding the perceived role of the clerk, compassionate care, assessment and feedback. Data were analyzed thematically. Findings: In addition to transitioning to a new learning environment, clerkship students assume different roles in response to complex and often competing expectations from preceptors. We identified three main themes: learning to impress preceptors with varying expectations, providing compassionate care—sometimes supported by preceptors, other times being secondary to efficiency—and passing assessments that required a different skill set than simply being a “good clerk.” Insights: Clerks perceive their role as providing compassionate care to patients and balance this with fulfilling the (sometimes) competing roles of being a student and developing medical professional. In a system where efficiency is often prioritized, medical students are afforded an opportunity to help satisfy the demand for greater compassion in patient-centered care. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059538314"

Prior frameworks of PCC describe multiple domains of patient-centeredness, ranging from interpersonal encounters to systems-level issues. Medical students' perceptions of PCC are thought to erode as they progress through school, but little is known about how students view PCC toward the beginning of training. This study explores the perceptions of PCC among 1st-year medical students to inform curricular development and evaluation. Approach: Medical students participated in semistructured, in-person interviews within 4 months of starting medical school as part of a longitudinal study. Transcripts were analyzed using a grounded theory approach and the constant comparative method to describe responses and characterize emergent themes. Transcripts were reviewed to compare codes and compile a final codebook. Findings: Thirty-eight students completed interviews. Students provided heterogeneous definitions of PCC, including perceptions that PCC is implicit and obvious. Many students were unable to provide a concrete definition of PCC, juxtaposing PCC with other priorities such as profit- or physician-centered care, whereas others thought the term was jargon. Some participants defined PCC as upholding patient values using hypothetical examples centered around physician behavior. Insights: Although students appeared to enter medical school with a range of perceptions about PCC, many of their descriptions were limited and only scratch the surface of existing frameworks. Rather than their perceptions of PCC eroding during medical school, students may never fully develop a foundational understanding of PCC. Our findings reinforce the need for authentic, clinically experiential learning opportunities that promote PCC from the earliest stages of medical education. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047922681"

Prior to formally becoming branch campuses, two AHEC sites had established innovative curricular structures different than the central campus. These sites worked with the central campus as clinical training sites. Upon becoming formal campuses, their unique clinical experiences were maintained. A third campus established a curricular structure identical to the central campus. Little exists in the literature regarding strategies that ensure comparability yet allow campuses to remain unique and innovative. Intervention: We implemented a balanced matrix organizational structure, well-defined communication plan, and newly developed tool to track comparability. A balanced matrix organization model framed the campus relationships. Adopting this model led to identifying reporting structures, developing multidirectional communication strategies, and the Campus Comparability Tool. Context: The UNC School of Medicine central campus is in Chapel Hill. All 192 students complete basic science course work on central campus. For required clinical rotations, approximately 140 students are assigned to the central campus, which includes rotations in Raleigh or Greensboro. The remaining students are assigned to Asheville (25–30), Charlotte (25–30), or Wilmington (5–7). Chapel Hill and Wilmington follow identical rotation structures, 16 weeks each of (a) combined surgery and adult inpatient experiences; (b) combined obstetrics/gynecology, psychiatry, and inpatient pediatrics; and (c) longitudinal clinical experiences in adult and pediatric medicine. Asheville offers an 8-month longitudinal integrated outpatient experience with discreet inpatient experiences in surgery and adult care. Charlotte offers a 6-month longitudinal integrated experiences and 6 months of block inpatient experiences. Aside from Charlotte and Raleigh, the other sites are urban but surrounded by rural counties. Chapel Hill is 221 miles from Asheville, 141 from Charlotte, and 156 from Wilmington. Outcome: Using the balanced matrix organization, various reporting structures and lines of communication ensured the educational objectives for students were clear on all campuses. The communication strategies facilitated developing consistent evaluation metrics across sites to compare educational experiences. Lessons Learned: The complexities of different healthcare systems becoming regional campuses require deliberate planning and understanding the culture of those sites. Recognizing how size and location of the organization affects communication, the central campus took the lead centralizing functions when appropriate. Adopting uniform educational technology has played an essential role in evaluating the comparability of core educational content on campuses delivering content in very distinct ways. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067665137"

Peer mentoring may be helpful for 1st-year medical students; however, little evidence is thus far available on which aspects of peer mentoring provide benefit and what those specific benefits are. Intervention: This study examines the perceived benefits and satisfaction derived by 1st-year medical students from participation in a semi-structured, informal cross-year peer mentoring program. It further attempts to characterize the aspects of peer mentoring relationships that are seen as beneficial to 1st-year students. Data were collected on demographic information, frequency and type of contact with mentor, perception of mentor characteristics, perceived benefits derived from the relationship, and their overall satisfaction with the relationship. Context: First-year medical students at a large academic institution were surveyed on their experience in an informal peer-mentoring program with 2nd-year students serving as mentors. Mentors had minimal training. No mandatory agenda or limitations were placed on the type or subject matter of interactions. Outcome: Mean overall satisfaction with the peer mentoring program was 7.47 (SD = 2.45) on a rating scale where 10 is the most satisfied. Students reported that their peer mentors generally exhibited beneficial attributes and behaviors. Ratings of perceived benefits were somewhat more variable and generally lower. Predictors of four outcomes—overall satisfaction, perceived academic benefit, perceived nonacademic benefit, and perceived clinical benefit—were explored using stepwise linear regression with forward entry and backward elimination to retain the most parsimonious model. Expertise in areas of mentee need was a consistent predictor of all outcomes. Regular involvement with a mentor was a consistent predictor of perceived academic and nonacademic benefit. Demographic characteristics were generally not predictive of outcomes. Lessons Learned: Peer mentoring is perceived by 1st-year medical students to provide psychosocial and academic benefits that appear to be independent of and complementary to those derived from faculty mentoring. These benefits can be established with minimal expenditure of institutional resources. Peer mentoring efficacy may be increased by more deliberate matching methods and by training mentors in provision of guidance and feedback, though further study is needed. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069957416"

Achieving reform requires changes in educational and clinical practice cultures, and clinician educators play a central role in championing change. In Japan, training in generalist fields has historically been lacking, but for decades the government has advocated alignment with Western models. Meanwhile, some Japanese physicians have pursued U.S. training in generalist fields with intention to help change the clinical education and practice systems back in Japan. This study examines the endeavors of repatriated Japanese International Medical Graduates and provides a lens to understanding national challenges with reform and insights into strategizing next steps. Approach: Individual, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 purposively sampled Japanese IMGs who had repatriated across Japan after completing U.S. clinical residency in generalist fields. Iterative data collection and thematic analyses were performed using constant comparison. Findings: Participants identified Japanese medical universities and public sectors as steeped in traditions with systemic inertia. In turn, participants described well-informed career decision making involving connections and teammates, which commonly resulted in employment at new or smaller hospitals. Education-related efforts prioritized direct clinical work with physician trainees in the hope of building expansive lineages of educators. Main challenges were Japanese structural and cultural incongruences with Western generalist-based clinical practice. Participants described a competitive relationship with the long-standing ikyoku-based postgraduate education model and associated organ-based organization of clinical practice. Insights: Japanese IMG championing of clinical education and practice in generalist fields is largely marginalized within Japan’s clinical education and practice landscape. National-level reform will require transforming or displacing the structurally and culturally rooted traditional infrastructure. Specific measures must be culturally nuanced but likely include those proven effective for similar reforms elsewhere. Based on Japan’s national cultural characteristics, sustained leadership is anticipated to be particularly important. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062770773"

Independent medical student research offers frequently overlooked opportunities to develop and assess professional practice abilities, including project design and implementation, interprofessional team communication, and time management. These skills, useful to physicians, are often challenging for medical students to master as they transition into clinical careers. To address this challenge, we designed and embedded interventional modalities into a highly mentored and longitudinal scholarly concentration component of the curriculum. Intervention: The Embark scholarly concentration program incorporates traditional research training with the development of professional practice skills essential for transitioning to clinical practice. The program includes individualized and just-in-time components enabling student access to information and feedback specific to their projects and development of professional practice skills. Context: The Embark program is a required longitudinal component of the Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine undergraduate medical curriculum. The Embark program consists of courses that inform and facilitate a required longitudinal independent research project. Outcome: A retrospective evaluation of the Embark program’s success with development of professional practice skills through the lens of both faculty and student perceptions included analysis of project records and course evaluation feedback. Evaluation of individual student development of transitional skill ability is possible through both quantitative and qualitative analysis of data collected from student project records. More than 80% of course evaluation commentary on strengths of the program addressed activities related to professional practice skills. To systematize the evaluation of these data sources, we have piloted a framework, iSAIL, designed to assess student development in these skills during the planning and conduct of a research project. Lessons learned: By developing professional practice skills in the context of a scholarly concentration program, medical students can build a foundation for future engagement in research while they develop skills to overcome challenges that they are likely to encounter in their clinical careers. Modalities designed to evaluate individualized student development of professional practice skills through research participation define program successes and may lead to the identification of additional resources needed by students. By offering medical students opportunities to develop professional practice skills within the protected environment of an independent research project, this scholarly concentration program provides a valuable opportunity to influence the early development of skills necessary throughout their clinical careers. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053475219"

Marconi, Rome, Italy","Phenomenon: Medical professionalism is a complex construct, based in social and cultural influences, yet little research has been done to show how culture influences the behaviors and attitudes of medical students. We presented Italian students with the same professional dilemmas used in a previous Canadian and Taiwanese cross-cultural study to look for similarities and differences and detect elements of Italian culture that influenced how students responded to dilemmas. The aim was to provide medical educators with some insights into students’ behavioral strategies and feelings when faced with a professional dilemma. Approach: Using Giorgi’s method, we performed a phenomenological analysis of 15 interviews of Italian medical students who responded to standardized video scenarios representing professional dilemmas. These videos were used in Canada and Taiwan and were translated into Italian. All students were from the same degree course, at Year 6, and were recruited on a voluntary basis at the beginning of the Internal Medicine course. Interview transcripts were anonymized before analysis. Findings: Scenarios were perceived as realistic and easy to envision in Italy. Four themes emerged: establishing priority among principles, using tactics to escape the dilemma, defending the self, and defending the relationships. When compared with previous studies, we noted that Italian students did not mention the principles of reporting inappropriate behavior, seeking excellence, or following senior trainees’ advice. Insights: This is the first cross-cultural study of professionalism that involves a Mediterranean country and the observed differences could be interpreted as expressions of Italian cultural traits: distrust toward authority and a cooperative rather than competitive attitude. These findings have practical implications for educators to design and run curricula of professionalism with culturally appropriate topics. They highlight the need for more cross-cultural research. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054849689"

We therefore invest heavily in teaching students how to do oral case presentations (OCPs), but the relative weights by which different aspects of these complex tasks contributes to an overall evaluation is poorly understood. Approach: We sought to contrast how clinical evaluators assess students’ OCPs and how medical students expect OCPs to be evaluated. Multiple linear regression and correlation matrices assessed how individual components of 3rd-year medical students’ OCPs affect overall faculty assessment of students’ performance using the previously validated Patient Presentation Rating tool. Preclinical medical students were surveyed to determine how they expect their OCPs to be evaluated. Findings: Faculty evaluations of students’ overall organization and descriptions of patients’ situations and vital signs were strongly associated with their overall OCP evaluation. Students believed that describing the patient’s situation, chief complaint, and history of present illness would be highly valued but not organization or vital signs descriptions. Insights: Students and faculty differ about what is important in OCPs. Aligning these perceptions through intentional redesign of curricula and feedback instruments may facilitate teaching clinical communication to students. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058707929"

We propose that leadership development is for all medical students, not for a subset, and we believe that leadership curricula and programs must be experiential and applied. Evidence: This paper also draws on the current literature and the experience of medical schools participating in the American Medical Association’s (AMA) Accelerating Change in Medical Education Consortium, confronts the common arguments against leadership training in medical education, and provides three cross-cutting principles that we believe must each be incorporated in all medical student-centered leadership development programs as they emerge and evolve at medical schools. Implications: By confronting common arguments against leadership training and providing a framework for such training, we give medical educators important tools and insights into developing leadership training for all students at their institutions. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084300186"

Background: The use of narrative evaluations in workplace settings is gaining credibility as an assessment tool, but it is unknown how assessors convey judgments using narratives in high-stakes standardized assessments. The aim of this study was to explore constructs (i.e., performance dimensions), as well as linguistic strategies that assessors use to distinguish between poor and good students when writing narrative assessment comments of communication skills during an OSCE. Approach: Eighteen assessors from Qatar University were recruited to write narrative assessment comments of communication skills for 14 students completing a summative OSCE. Assessors scored overall communication performance on a 5-point scale. Narrative evaluations for the top and bottom 2 performing students for each station (based on communication scores) were analyzed for linguistic strategies and constructs that informed assessment decisions. Results: Seventy-two narrative evaluations with 662 comments were analyzed. Most comments (77%) were written without the use of politeness strategies. A further 22% of comments were hedged. Hedging was used more commonly in poor performers, compared to good performers (30% vs. 15%, respectively). Overarching constructs of confidence, adaptability, patient safety, and professionalism were key dimensions that characterized the narrative evaluations of students’ performance. Conclusions: Results contribute to our understanding regarding the utility of narrative comments for summative assessment of communication skills. Assessors’ comments could be characterized by the constructs of confidence, adaptability, patient safety, and professionalism when distinguishing between levels of student performance. Findings support the notion that judgments are arrived at by clustering sets of behaviors into overarching and meaningful constructs rather than by solely focusing on discrete behaviors. These results call for the development of better-anchored evaluation tools for communication assessment during OSCEs, constructively aligned with assessors’ map of the reality of professional practice. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067104601"

Yet the understanding of medical epistemology - focused on what kinds of medical knowledge are relevant to clinical decisions, the strengths and limitations of those different kinds of knowledge, and how they relate to one another and to clinical expertise - represents a critical aspect of medical practice. Evidence: Understanding the meaning of the term “evidence” is one of the fundamental tasks of medical epistemology. Other foundations of the evidence-based medicine movement, such as the “hierarchy of evidence” and the concept of “best” evidence, rest upon epistemological assertions, claims regarding the appropriate kinds and relative value of knowledge in medicine. Here we rely upon the work of philosophers of medicine who have been engaged in debates regarding the epistemic tenets of the evidence-based medicine movement. We argue that medical students and physicians-in-training should learn basic terminology and methods of epistemology as they are being introduced to the concepts and techniques of evidence-based medicine. Implications: The skepticism and critical analysis encouraged by EBM can and should be applied to the underlying assumptions and primary tenets of EBM itself. It is not enough for philosophers to partake in this endeavor; students, trainees, and clinicians need to carefully and constantly examine the reasons and reasoning that coalesce into clinical acumen. Our role as medical educators is to give them the tools, including a basic understanding of epistemology, to do that over a lifetime. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097990132"

However, due to an increase in the number of M.D.-granting medical schools and medical school class sizes, academic medical institutions have struggled to recruit community preceptors to teach their students. This task has been made more difficult due to rising pressures upon institutions and clinicians—for example, increased productivity demands, greater volume and oversight of electronic health record documentation, and competition for community preceptors from both D.O. and non-U.S.-based medical schools. Although academic institutions have historically relied largely on altruistic motives and intrinsic rewards to actively engage and retain community-based preceptors, alternative models have arisen, chiefly those in which community-based preceptors are explicitly compensated for teaching. Approach: To study this phenomenon, representatives of the Alliance for Clinical Education developed and deployed a 31-item survey accompanied with a subset of free text questions to the collective membership of its 8-member constituent organizations. Survey questions explored if community preceptors were compensated indirectly or directly and what types of compensation were provided, if any. There were 188 surveys analyzed, with an estimated response rate of 18.2%. Findings: Twenty-six percent of respondents indicated they compensate community preceptors directly and/or indirectly. Respondents discussed their motivations for payment (or nonpayment), mechanisms for paying, aspirations to pay, and expectations of the recipient. No statistically significant association was found when comparing responses of paid versus not paid by region. Free text responses provided additional insight regarding payment considerations, institutional competition, recruitment/retention, recognition, and education issues. Insights: Increasingly, medical schools are finding it necessary to provide funding for community preceptors in order to retain them. New creative forms of compensation to community preceptors may prove important in the future for this vital aspect of medical student education. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059301684"

An underused but potentially valuable alternative is to enroll near-peers to teach professionalism. Intervention: We describe a novel near-peer curriculum on professionalism developed at Queen’s University School of Medicine. Senior medical students considered role models by their classmates were nominated to facilitate small-group seminars with junior students on topics in professionalism. Each session was preceded by brief pre-readings or prompts and engaged students in semistructured, open-ended discussion. Three 2-hour sessions have occurred annually. Context: The near-peer sessions are a required component (6 hours; 20%) of the 1st-year professionalism course at Queen’s University (30 hours), which otherwise includes faculty-led seminars, lectures, and online modules. Senior facilitators are selected through a peer nomination process during their 3rd year of medical school. This format was chosen to create a highly regarded position to which students could aspire by demonstrating positive professionalism. Outcome: We performed a qualitative descriptive evaluation of the near-peer curriculum. Fifty-six medical students participated in 11 focus group interviews, which were coded and analyzed for themes inductively and deductively. Quantitative reviews of student feedback forms and a third-party thematic analysis were performed to triangulate results. Medical students preferred the near-peer-led discussion-based curriculum to faculty-led seminars and didactic or online formats. Junior students could describe specific examples of how the curriculum had influenced their behavior in academic, clinical, and personal settings. They cited senior near-peer facilitators as the strongest aspect of the curriculum for their social and cognitive congruence. Senior students who had facilitated sessions regarded the peer teaching experience as formative to their own understanding of professionalism. Lessons Learned: Formal medical curricula on professionalism should emphasize near-peer-led small-group discussion as it fosters a nuanced understanding of professionalism for both early level students and senior students acting as teachers. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058678398"

Social-cognitivist models of self-regulated learning suggest value when guiding learners to set goals related to their performance processes (actions producing outcomes) versus their performance outcomes (products of performance). Hypotheses: We expected participants oriented to set process goals would demonstrate better suturing skill retention compared with participants oriented to set outcome goals. Method: We randomly assigned 41 medical students to two groups: outcome oriented or process oriented. They self-scored their performance using a visual analog scale on every third trial during 25 training trials, and during 10 retention trials 2 weeks later. Two raters assessed participants’ suturing performances (process) and final products (outcome). After finding weak support for our hypothesis, we calculated a “self-monitoring calibration coefficient” as the Pearson’s correlation between the raters’ average score and each participant’s self-scores. We used a mixed-effects analysis of variance to compare participants’ performance scores as well as t tests and an analysis of variance to compare their self-monitoring calibration coefficients. Results: Analysis of skill retention data revealed a significant Group × Trial interaction, suggesting a benefit for the process group only for the 10th retention trial (p =.03). During training, the process group had significantly better (p =.02) self-monitoring calibration (r =.71 ±.29) than the outcome group (r =.38 ±.55). In retention, participants in both groups were significantly better calibrated (p =.04) with rater’s scores of performance processes (r =.39 ±.60) versus performance outcomes (r =.11 ±.63). Conclusions: Our findings provide limited evidence for our original hypothesis. Perhaps more important, however, our self-monitoring calibration data highlighted inconsistencies between our interventions and our participants’ apparent preferences. Not all participants adopted their assigned goal setting orientation, showing that researchers and educators must consider the extent to which trainees adopt imposed instructions in any educational intervention. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064659087"

Evidence: Prior studies have identified differential experiences within the learning environment, lack of social supports, and implicit bias in evaluations as barriers to the academic interests and successes of UIM learners. The UCSF Differences Matter initiative has shown that interventions focused on recruiting diverse academic faculty, building strong social communities, facilitating cross-cultural communication and understanding, and mitigating disparities in summative assessments can positively affect the educational experience for UIM learners and contribute to their academic success. Implications: Institution-level initiatives are needed to foster a culture of inclusion, teach cultural humility, and build a culture of trust within academic medicine. Such initiatives should aim to teach a common language to discuss diversity issues and place the responsibility of fostering inclusion on all members of the academic community. Our own institutional experience with systemic cultural reform challenges others to develop novel approaches toward fostering inclusion in academic medicine. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074046753"

Symptoms of burnout include withdrawal or disengagement from work. Burnout has become an important public health concern due to its association with severe negative consequences across numerous professions. Background: The most widely used instrument for measuring burnout is the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). An adaptation of the MBI, the MBI–Student Survey (MBI-SS), was developed for college students. The MBI-SS consists of 15 items covering 3 domains of burnout: exhaustion, cynicism (CY), and professional efficacy (PE). Although studies have confirmed the validity of the MBI-SS for college student populations, studies of its use with medical students are limited. The purpose of this study was to employ the Rasch model to examine the psychometric properties of the MBI-SS when used with a population of preclinical medical students. Approach: Data were collected from 787 medical students who answered the MBI-SS at the conclusion of their 1st year. A maximum likelihood exploratory factor analysis for ordinal data confirmed the hypothesized three factor structure of the MBI-SS. Subsequently, a Rasch analysis was employed to further evaluate the measurement properties of MBI-SS. We used the Rasch Rating Scale model to investigate the extent to which the three MBI subscales conformed to proper measurement characteristics, including comprehensive coverage of person ability and item difficulty along the latent continuum. Results: Most of the 15 items on the MBI-SS effectively fit the Rasch Rating Scale Model, with minimal measurement error. Respondents effectively used the full range of the rating scale for all 15 items. Two subscales (PE and CY) contained items that were difficult for respondents to endorse, resulting in significant gaps along the measurement continuum. The CY subscale exhibited a slight floor effect. The 3 subscales showed good person reliability, good real-item reliability, and good person separation. Conclusions: The Rasch analysis confirmed that the MBI-SS works well for measuring burnout among preclinical medical students. However, the Rasch analysis was able to identify that additional items are needed to improve the performance of MBI-SS. New items would be targeted at reducing the floor effect for the CY subscale and filling the other gaps in measurement along the latent continuum for the PE and CY subscales. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059031928"

Slowing down to consider context and reflect on practice are now seen as essential to medical education as we are called upon to examine carefully what we are doing to care for learners and improve their performance, professionalism, and well-being. Philosophy can be seen as the fundamental approach to pausing at times of complexity and uncertainty to ask basic questions about seemingly obvious practices so that we can see (and do) things in new ways. Evidence: Philosophy and medical education have long been related; many of our basic concepts can be traced to philosophical ideas. Philosophy is a problem-creation approach, and its method is analysis; it is a constant process of shifting frames and turning into objects of analysis the lenses through which we see the world. However, philosophy is not about constant questioning for the sake of questioning. Progression in medical education practice involves recognizing when to switch from a philosophical to a practical perspective, and when to switch back. Implications: In medical education, a philosophical approach empowers us to “slow down when we should,” thereby engaging us more directly with our subjects of study, revealing our assumptions, and helping us address vexing problems from a new angle. Doing philosophy involves thinking like a beginner, getting back to basics, and disrupting frames of reference. Being philosophical is about wonder and intense, childlike curiosity, human qualities we all share. Taking a philosophical approach to medical education need not be an unguided endeavor, but can be a dialog through which medical educators and philosophers learn together. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Background: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) created milestones to measure learner progression toward competence over time but not as direct assessment tools. Ideal measurement of resident performance includes direct observation and assessment of patient care skills in the workplace. Residency programs have linked these concepts by mapping workplace-based assessments to the milestones of ACGME subcompetencies. Mapping is a subjective process, and little is known about specific techniques or the resulting consequences of mapping program-specific assessment data to larger frameworks of competency. Approach: In this article, the authors compare and contrast the techniques used to link workplace-based assessments called Observable Practice Activities (OPAs) to ACGME subcompetencies in two large academic residency programs from different specialties (Internal Medicine and Pediatrics). Descriptive analysis explored the similarities and differences in the assessment data generated by mapping assessment items to larger frameworks of competency. Results: Each program assessed the core competencies with similar frequencies. The largest discrepancy between the two subspecialties was the assessment of Medical Knowledge, which Internal Medicine assessed twice as often. Pediatrics also assessed the core competency Systems-based Practice almost twice as often as Internal Medicine. Both programs had several subcompetencies that were assessed more or less often than what appeared to be emphasized by the blueprint of mapping. Despite using independent mapping processes, both programs mapped each OPA to approximately three subcompetencies. Conclusions: Mapping workplace-based assessments to the ACGME subcompetencies allowed each program to see the whole of their curricula in ways that were not possible before and to identify existing curricular and assessment gaps. Although each program used similar assessment tools, the assessment data generated were different. The lessons learned in this work could inform other programs attempting to link their own workplace-based assessment elements to ACGME subcompetencies. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073960880"

Research has demonstrated that teaching (junior) physicians to deliver high-value, cost-conscious care can be effective when learning is situated in a supportive environment. This study aims to offer insight into how residents learn to provide high-value, cost-conscious care in the workplace and how the postgraduate training environment influences this learning. Approach: Six homogeneous focus groups were held between August 2015 and July 2016 with 36 residents from six residency programs (dermatology, n = 5; elderly care, n = 8; family medicine, n = 5; internal medicine, n = 6; orthopedic surgery, n = 6; surgery, n = 6). An iterative grounded theory approach was used to analyze the qualitative data. Findings: Influential factors in learning of high-value, cost-conscious care delivery operated on three levels: individual resident, training program, and the workplace. On the individual level, we discerned three types of beliefs regarding HV3C. At the training program level, perceived determinants of learning included resident–supervisor interactions, involvement in decision-making over time, and exposure to variation in care delivery. At the workplace level, learning depended on the availability of professional healthcare expertise and the presence of institutional policy. Insights: Residents struggle to seize high-value, cost-conscious care learning opportunities in the workplace setting. Both residency training programs and workplaces can contribute to creating these learning opportunities. An important starting point is being aware of the different personal beliefs of residents and the approaches to high-value, cost-conscious care on the level of the training program and workplace. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

This study aimed to define IC competencies spanning multiple competency domains. Approach: Iterative facilitated discussions were conducted at a half-day education retreat with 25 key informants including clinician educators and education scientists. Seven one-on-one semistructured interviews were subsequently conducted with different interprofessional providers in IC settings within a Canadian context. Data collection grounded in patient cases with a physical illness and concurrent mental illness (medical psychiatry) were used to elicit identification of complex patient needs and the key medical psychiatry knowledge and skills required to address these needs. A thematic analysis of transcripts was performed using constant comparison to iteratively identify themes. Findings: Participants described 4 broad competency domains necessary for expertise in IC: (a) extensive integrated knowledge of biopsychosocial aspects of disease, systems of care, and social determinants of care; (b) skills to establish a longitudinal alliance with the patient and functional relationships with colleagues; (c) constructing a comprehensive understanding of individual patients’ complex needs and how these can be met within their health and social systems; and (d) the ability to effectively meet the patient’s needs using IC models. These 4 domains were linked by an overarching philosophy of care encompassing key enabling attitudes such as proactively pursuing depth to understand patient and system complexity while maintaining a patient-centered approach. Insights: The study addresses how development of IC expertise can be fostered by integration of individual IC competency domains. The findings align with previous research suggesting that competencies from existing frameworks are being enacted jointly in expert capabilities to meet the complex needs of patients, in this case with comorbid physical and mental health concerns. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071972763"

Stigma may prevent medical students from seeking psychological help when experiencing distress, which may hinder their job performance and mental health. Compassionate values—preferred principles that guide attitudes and behaviors to focus on the wellness of others—may be a relevant predictor of medical students’ perceptions of psychological help. The present study examined the association between medical students’ compassionate values, help-seeking stigma, and help-seeking attitudes in a convenience sample of medical students. Hypotheses: Rating compassionate values as more important than self-interested values will be associated with less stigma, which in turn will be associated with more positive help-seeking attitudes. Method: There were 220 medical students in their 2nd year of medical training who were recruited in-class and through e-mail between January and March of 2017 at Des Moines University. Students were provided an anonymous online link to a survey composed of validated measures assessing values, psychological distress, and stigma and attitudes related to psychological help. Results: The survey response rate was 41%, leaving a final sample of 91. For every 1 SD increase in the relative importance of compassionate values over self-interested values, help-seeking stigma decreased 0.40 SDs, and help-seeking attitudes increased 0.23 SDs. Conclusions: Prioritizing compassionate values more strongly than self-interested values is associated with medical students’ perceiving psychological help-seeking more positively. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059691220"

Recently, a number of editors of health sciences journals have begun to support, and even espouse, the practice of group peer review (GPR). With GPR, multiple individuals work together to complete the review with permission from the journal editor. Motivated by the idea that GPR could provide a meaningful service learning experience for participants in an interprofessional educational scholarship course, we conducted three such reviews and subsequently reflected on our experience and the lessons we learned. We frame our reflections using guiding principles from the domains of peer review, professional development, and educational scholarship. Intervention: The course director arranged for manuscripts to review with the editors of three health sciences journals. Each GPR occurred during a separate weekly session of the course. Each GPR was completed using a similar set of steps, which included (a) gaining familiarity with review criteria, (b) reading aloud and discussing the manuscript’s abstract as a class, (c) reading and critiquing assigned sections as individuals and then small groups, (d) building consensus and sharing notes, (e) having the course director syntShesize notes into a single review for submission to the journal. Context: The course on educational scholarship involved 15 faculty representing faculty from the University of Utah’s School of Medicine, College of Nursing, College of Pharmacy, College of Health, and School of Dentistry. The course director led three GPR sessions mid-way through the yearlong course. Impact: Participants’ reflections indicate that GPR (a) conformed to principles of effective peer review; (b) resulted in a meaningful service learning experience within a formal professional development program, deepening understanding of core concepts of educational scholarship; and (c) represented an authentic example of engaging in educational scholarship (i.e., designing and evaluating an intervention while drawing upon and contributing to a body of shared understanding within a community of practice). Lessons Learned: Our principles-based approach to completing GPR within a professional development course on educational scholarship can serve as a model for others to follow.

Adversarial interactions between physicians and patients from other cultures hinder access to quality health services and reinforce health disparities. Cultural safety is an approach to medical training that encourages practitioners to examine how their own culture shapes their clinical practice and how to respect their patients’ worldviews. This approach could help bridge the cultural divide in Colombian health services, improving multicultural access to health services and reducing health disparities. Intervention: In 2016, we conducted a pilot cultural safety training program in Cota, Colombia. A five-month training program for medical students included: (a) theoretical training on cultural safety and participatory research, and (b) a community-based intervention, co-designed by community leaders, training supervisors, and the medical students, with the aim of strengthening cultural practices related to health. Evaluation used the Most Significant Change narrative approach, which allows participants to communicate the changes most meaningful to them. Using an inductive thematic analysis, the authors analyzed the stories and discussed these findings in a debriefing session with the medical students. Context: Cota is located only 15 kilometers from Bogota, the national capital and biggest city of Colombia, so the small town has gone through rapid urbanization and cultural change. A few decades ago, inhabitants of Cota were mainly peasants with Indigenous and European traditions. Urbanization displaced agriculture with industrial and commercial occupations. One consequence of this change was loss of cultural health care practices and resources, for example, medicinal plants, that the community had used for centuries. Impact: A group of 13 final-year medical students (ten female and three male, age range 20–24) participated in the study. The medical students listed four areas of change after their experience: increased respect for traditional health practices to provide better healthcare; increased recognition of traditional practices as part of their cultural heritage and identity; a desire to deepen their knowledge about cultural practices; and openness to incorporate cultural practices in healthcare. Lessons Learned: Medical students reported positive perceptions of their patients’ cultural practices after participating in this community-based training program. The training preceded a positive shift in perceptions and was accepted by Colombian medical students. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first documented cultural safety training initiative with medical students in Colombia and an early attempt to apply the cultural safety approach outside the Indigenous experience. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089678089"

In large medical schools, longitudinal integrated clerkships may not be feasible, so other ways must be sought to expose students to prolonged contact with patients. Intervention: Medical students were attached to a family practice and assigned a panel of 4 patients to follow over the 3 years of their clinical training. Their role was that of companion on the patient’s medical journey. The program consisted of several encounters, joining the patient in the medical setting for significant events, and written assignments. This intervention was piloted with 35 students. We describe our experiences from the 1st pilot year of this program. Context: The intervention was performed with 3rd-year students—of a 6-year curriculum—at a large medical school in the Netherlands. Outcome: Finding enough patients per practice was feasible. On the whole, students fulfilled the program’s expectations regarding frequency of patient encounters and assignments. The most frequent problems encountered by the students were uncertainty about their role and setting boundaries in their contact with the patients. They needed more preceptor supervision and coaching than they received. Lessons Learned: For junior students, close and structured supervision led by the faculty is necessary to help them navigate and learn from a panel of patients. Students need guidance about what role they should take on and on how to manage both their own and their patient’s expectations. Guided reflection is necessary to help students give meaning to their experiences with patients. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Our aim in this study was twofold: to identify family physicians’ motivations to enroll as preceptors in a longitudinal undergraduate family medicine program and to explore the nature of the student–preceptor relationships built during the course. Approach: This was a qualitative exploratory case study. The case was the first edition of a longitudinal family medicine experience (LFME), a course that makes up part of the novel Medicinae Doctor et Chirurgiae Magister curriculum in place in a Canadian medical school since August 2013. All 173 family physician community preceptors of the academic year 2013–2014 were considered key informants in the investigation. Forty-three preceptors finally participated in one of six focus groups conducted in the spring of 2014. Several organizational documents relative to the LFME course were also gathered. Inductive semantic thematic analysis was performed on verbatim interview transcripts. Documents helped contextualize the major themes emerging from the focus groups discussions. Findings: Enjoying teaching, promoting family medicine, and improving medical education where salient motivations for family physicians to become LFME preceptors. The findings also pointed out the complexity of the student–preceptor exchanges that unfolded over the academic year, and the ambiguous and changing nature of the role that LFME preceptors adopted in their relationships with students: from simply being facilitators of students’ clinical observership to behaving as their mentors. Insights: Family physicians were highly motivated to become LFME preceptors of 1st-year medical students. Whereas they consistently valued the relationships built during the academic year with the students assigned to them, they also considered that exchanges did not always happen without difficulties, and gauged the roles they played as complex, ambiguous, and necessarily evolving over time. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057344046"

Consequently, faculty differ in their attitudes toward pimping, and such differences may be measurable and used to inform future research regarding the impact of pimping on learner outcomes. Background: Despite renewed attention in medical education on creating a supportive learning environment, there is a dearth of prior research on pimping. We sought to characterize faculty who are more aggressive in their questioning style (i.e., those with a “pimper” phenotype) from those who are less threatening. Approach: This study was conducted between December 2015 and September 2016 at Johns Hopkins University. We created a 13-item questionnaire assessing faculty perceptions on pimping as a pedagogical technique. We surveyed all medicine faculty (n = 150) who had attended on inpatient teaching services at two university-affiliated hospitals over the prior 2 years. Then, using responses to the faculty survey, we developed a numeric “pimping score” designed to characterize faculty into “pimper” (those with scores in the upper quartile of the range) and “nonpimper” phenotypes. Results: The response rate was 84%. Although almost half of the faculty reported that being pimped helped them in their own learning (45%), fewer reported that pimping was effective in their own teaching practice (20%). The pimping score was normally distributed across a range of 13–42, with a mean of 24 and a 75th percentile cutoff of 28 or greater. Younger faculty, male participants, specialists, and those reporting lower quality of life had higher pimping score values, all p <.05. Faculty who openly endorsed favorable views about the educational value of pimping had sevenfold higher odds of being characterized as “pimpers” using our numeric pimping score (p ≤.001). Conclusions: The establishment of a quantitative pimping score may have relevance for training programs concerned about the learning environment in clinical settings and may inform future research on the impact of pimping on learning outcomes. © 2018, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. © 2018, © John W.

It called for health care education that no longer focuses exclusively on the mastery of technical skills but teaches students the human dimensions of care and develops their ability to collaborate with patients and colleagues to alleviate suffering and improve health. When should this educational reform begin, by what frameworks should it be guided, and which methods should it employ are important questions to explore. Evidence: There is increasing evidence that practitioners' relational skills, such as empathy and reflection, improve patients' health outcomes. Efforts to shift education toward patient-centered care in interprofessional teams have been made at the professional level, most notably in medical schools. However, reform must begin at the preprofessional level, to start cultivation of the habits that support humane care as early as possible and protect against empathic decline and the development of counterproductive attitudes to collaboration. The conceptual basis for reform is offered by relationship-centered care (RCC), a framework that goes beyond patient-centered care and interprofessional teamwork to focus on the reciprocal human interactions at the micro, mezzo, and macro levels of care. RCC identifies practitioners' relationships with patients, colleagues, community, and self as the critical interpersonal dimensions of healthcare and describes a foundation of values, knowledge, and skills required for teaching each dimension. The teaching of these foundations can be facilitated with techniques from narrative medicine, a compatible care model that conceptualizes health care as a context in which humans exchange stories and thus require narrative competence. Implications: We suggest beginning the educational reform at the preprofessional level with the implementation of a formal curriculum based on the 4 RCC dimensions with students expected to gain beginner levels of competency on these dimensions in addition to evidence-based principles of health sciences. This requires interprofessional collaboration among health professions, social science, and liberal arts faculty and training of health professions faculty in narrative medicine. Next, we suggest engaging in incremental change in the organizational culture with professional development and team-building activities. Although we need systematic research on the efficacy of the components of the transformation, their impact on students' learning, and their costs, it is important to engage in efforts to prepare professionals who are able to respond to the complex health needs of individuals and society in the 21st century. © 2016, © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84965031221"

Self-esteem is another important construct that is less well studied. Self-esteem is important because low levels have been linked to depression, suicide, and eating disorders. Given that health professional students experience high levels of stress and are at increased risk for similar psychopathology, self-esteem may be an important variable in student well-being and performance after graduation. Hypotheses: This study sought to explore self-esteem during students’ 1st year of training hypothesizing that several would demonstrate low self-esteem. It is also hypothesized that emotional intelligence and empathy would be associated with self-esteem. Method: A cross-sectional survey was conducted, and data were gathered from dental, medical, nursing, optometry, pharmacy and veterinary students. Self-report questionnaires assessing self-esteem, emotional intelligence, and empathy were completed and demographic information was collected. Scores were calculated and differences between groups analyzed with analysis of variance and chi-square testing. Pearson’s correlation was used to assess associations between the constructs. Results: The mean self-esteem score was 26.2 ± 2.3 but 21% of the sample evidenced low self-esteem. There was no difference in the proportion of students demonstrating low self-esteem among programs. Gender did not have a significant effect on self-esteem scores, though ethnicity did. Emotional intelligence scores were higher among male individuals than among female. Emotional intelligence and empathy showed a small association with self-esteem. Conclusions: A significant proportion of health professional students suffer from low self-esteem during their 1st year of study. Such students may be more susceptible to the stresses associated with study and the development of psychopathology. More research needs to be conducted to explore the relationships between self-esteem, emotional intelligence, and empathy with a view to strengthening training in these areas and managing the challenges faced by health professional students. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065731848"

According to conceptual change theory, changes in personal conceptualizations are initiated when cognitive disequilibrium is introduced. We sought to identify the experiences that trigger cognitive disequilibrium and to subsequently describe students' perceptions of self-in-profession prior to the experience; the nature of the experience; and, when applicable, the outcomes of the experience. Approach: This article summarizes findings from portions of data collected in a larger qualitative study conducted at a new medical school in the United States that utilizes diverse pedagogies and experiences to develop student knowledge, clinical skills, attitudes, and dispositions. Primary data sources included focus groups and individual interviews with students across the 4 years of the curriculum (audio data). Secondary data included students' comments from course and end-of-year evaluations for the 2013–2017 classes (text data). Data treatment tools available in robust qualitative software, NVivo 10, were utilized to expedite coding of both audio and text data. Content analysis was adopted as the analysis method for both audio and text data. Findings: We identified four experiences that triggered cognitive disequilibrium in relationship to students' perceptions of self-in-profession: (a) transition from undergraduate student to medical student, (b) clinical experiences in the preclinical years, (c) exposure to the business of medicine, and (d) exposure to physicians in clinical practice. Insights: We believe these experiences represent vulnerable periods of professional identity formation during medical school. Educators interested in purposefully shaping curriculum to encourage adaptive professional identity development during medical school may find it useful to integrate educational interventions that assist students with navigating the disequilibrium that is introduced during these periods. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044730322"

Mastery learning is an effective method for boosting clinical skills, but its applicability to the EPAs remains to be studied. The authors designed this study to evaluate a mastery learning intervention to teach and assess components of 3 of the 13 EPAs in a 4th-year capstone course. Intervention: The course featured mastery learning principles and addressed three EPA-based skills: (a) obtain informed consent, (b) develop a differential diagnosis and write admission orders, and (c) write discharge prescriptions. All students underwent a baseline skills assessment, received feedback, engaged in deliberate practice with actionable feedback, and completed a similar skills-based posttest assessment. Students continued with practice and testing until the minimum passing standards (MPSs) were reached for each posttest. Context: All medical students at a single medical school (Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine) who matriculated in 2012 and graduated with the class of 2016 participated in a required transition to residency course immediately prior to graduation. Outcome: There were 134 students eligible to participate, and 130 (97.0%) completed all curricular requirements and assessments. All 130 medical students who completed the course met or exceeded the MPS for each of the three EPA-based clinical skills. Reliability coefficients for outcome data were uniformly high. Measures for each of the three clinical skills showed statistically significant improvement. Lessons Learned: The capstone course was an effective approach to teach and assess components of three EPA-based clinical skills to mastery learning standards in a 4th-year capstone course. We learned that this approach for implementation is feasible and results in significant improvement in components of EPA skill performance. Next steps will include developing assessments incorporating the mastery model into components of additional EPAs, identifying the best location within the curriculum to insert this content, and expanding the number of assessments as part of a larger assessment system. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059352322"

Little is known about learning stressors for medical students on the obstetrics and gynecology clerkship to inform stress-reducing interventions and improve learning experience. This study investigated (a) which aspects of the learning environment are most stressful for obstetrics and gynecology clerkship students, (b) how perceived learning stressors in this environment differ for medical students and teachers (residents, fellows, and faculty), and (c) what interventions students propose to address these stressors. Approach: From May 2015 to April 2016, we conducted semistructured individual interviews with 3rd-year medical students from obstetrics and gynecology clerkship cohorts (n = 52) as well as clerkship teachers (n = 10) at an academic medical center. Two investigators used a qualitative Framework Method approach to analyze the interview data and agree upon final themes. Findings: We identified labor and delivery as the most stressful learning environment and four labor and delivery–related themes of students’ learning stressors: context (pace, logistics, nature of childbirth, and nonroutine schedule), learning tasks (student role and assignments and the amount of new knowledge and skills), communication (terminology used in conversation and interacting with the labor and delivery team), and clinical scenario (crisis, emergency, and patient refusal of student involvement). Whereas students identified context as causing most of the stress, teachers concentrated on stressors related to learning tasks. Insights: Learning stressors associated with students’ educational experience in the clinical context of labor and delivery are challenging for medical students. In addition to the specific content of these challenges, the recognition that teachers’ assumptions about sources of stressors are different from those of students is an important finding and has implications for changing the learning environment. Clerkship programs are encouraged to provide practical guidelines and embed an introduction of the clinical learning environment into the Obstetrics and Gynecology clerkship orientation curriculum. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063394578"

Background: Residents teach patients, families, medical students, physicians, and other health professionals during and beyond their training. Despite this expectation, it is unclear how the development of residents as educators is reflected in the specialty-specific Milestones. Approach: We performed a textual content analysis of 25 specialty Milestone documents available as downloads from the ACGME website in December 2015. Syntactical units of interest included developmental progressions that describe the development of educators over the course of residency training and 16 key terms identified during the analysis. We then categorized the terms by associated Milestone level, ACGME core competency, and targeted learner(s). Results: We identified 10 developmental progressions and 546 instances of the 16 key terms that describe the development of physician educators. The frequency of terms among specialties was quite variable (5–46 terms per specialty, Mdn = 21). The majority of education-related terms appeared at advanced Milestone levels; there were 139 (26%) such instances in Level 4 and 296 (54%) in Level 5. Education-related terms were identified in all six ACGME core competencies, with greatest frequency in Patient Care (157, 29%). Other residents were the learners most frequently targeted by education-related Milestones (211, 40%). Conclusions: The current ACGME Milestones largely imply that resident teaching is a high-level or aspirational goal, achieved without a clear or consistently assessed developmental progression. These findings run counter to the theoretical basis that underlies the development of the Milestones. Wide variation among specialties indicates lack of consensus around the ideal skill set of the resident educator and limits the utility of these documents for curriculum development in this domain. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060630247"

The impact of key stakeholder engagement, learner-centeredness, intrinsic competencies, and assessment on the efficacy of this process has not been examined. The objective of this scoping review was to explore the nature of the existing scholarship on programs that aim to facilitate the transition from medical school to residency. Approach: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to April 2020. Programs were included if they were aimed at medical students completing undergraduate medical training or first year residents and an evaluative component. Two authors independently screened all abstracts and full text articles in duplicate. Data were extracted and categorized by type of program, study design, learner-centeredness, key stakeholder engagement, the extent of information sharing about the learner to facilitate the transition to residency, and specific program elements including participants, and program outcomes. We also extracted data on intrinsic (non-Medical Expert) competencies, as defined by the CanMEDS competency framework. Findings: Of the 1,006 studies identified, 55 met the criteria for inclusion in this review. The majority of the articles that were eligible for inclusion were from the United States (n = 31, 57%). Most of the studies (n = 47, 85%) employed quantitative, or mixed method research designs. Positive outcomes that were commonly reported included increased self-confidence, competence in being prepared for residency, and satisfaction with the transition program. While a variety of learner-centered programs that focus on specific intrinsic competencies have been implemented, many (n = 29, 52%) did not report engaging learners as key stakeholders in program development. Insights: While programs that aim to ease the transition from medical school to residency can enhance both Medical Expert and other intrinsic competencies, there is much room for novel transition programs to define their goals more broadly and to incorporate multiple areas of professional development. The existing literature highlights various gaps in approaches to easing the transition from medical school to residency, particularly with respect to key stakeholder engagement, addressing intrinsic CanMEDS competencies, and focusing on individual learners’ needs. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091176065"

Few studies have evaluated the association of medical students’ mental health and their sexual orientation. This study aimed to evaluate differences in mental health indicators among medical students with diverse sexual orientations at a South American medical school. Approach: This study is a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data obtained through an electronic survey. The survey assessed demographics, academic variables, and several mental health scales and indexes, including: World Health Organization Well-being Index, Satisfaction With Life Scale, Family APGAR (Adaptability, Partnership, Growth, Affection, and Resolve), Self-Reporting Questionnaire, Athens Insomnia Scale, Eating Attitudes Test, and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Sexual orientation was assessed using self-identification and responses dichotomized as heterosexual and non-heterosexual. Findings: 554 students completed the survey (response rate: 70%). Mean age was 20.6 years, and the sample was 58.7% women. Eighty-two participants (14.8%) self-identified as non-heterosexual; this group comprised mostly males, fewer of whom lived with their family, and more of whom used loans or scholarships to pay university tuition fees. After adjustment for sex and tuition fee payment, non-heterosexual orientation was significantly associated (adjusted Odds Ratios [aOR] above 3.00) with rating mental health as bad, self-perceiving a need for mental health evaluation/treatment, and reporting last-year use of psychiatric medication. Lastly, non-heterosexual respondents reported more frequent psychiatric symptoms (depression/anxiety scores, suicidal ideation, eating disorder symptoms and substance use) with an aOR between 2.17 and 2.51. Insights: This study suggests that self-identified non-heterosexual medical students exhibit worse mental health outcomes evaluated through validated self-report scales and subjective perception of mental health status. This report specifically indicates that non-heterosexual medical students report family dysfunction more often and have less social support, which serve as additional risk factors. Future studies must assess social support, clarify the impact of family and peer support in mental health problems, and explore students’ views on their sexual identity and the burden imposed by experiences of discrimination. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089983383"

This article seeks to document inquiry practices in 2 such encounters in a setting designed to emulate a consequential, clinical skills examination. Approach: Drawing on the methods and findings of Conversation Analysis, we examine selected fragments seeking to understand how, in the ways in which they are organized, they produce quite different outcomes. Findings: In the first encounter, the topic of the patient's history of depression arises naturally in the course of the interview. It happens to be a checklist item for the case and the examinee receives credit for having elicited it. In the second encounter, though the examinee was the more clinically experienced, the topic does not come up and the examinee fails to receive credit. Insights: When we examine how the two inquiry sequences develop on a turn-by-turn basis, it becomes clear that the differences between inquiry practices that carefully constrain patient responses and those that leave space for patient elaboration are subtle but evident. Both types of practice, however, are presumably a part of competent clinical performance. We argue that looking carefully at how specific interactional practices operate within clinical interviews can enable us to become more articulate as to what might count as communicative competence in the clinic. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061064579"

Among studies presented at professional meetings, registered as clinical trials, or declined from specific journals, nonpublication rates are estimated to range from 25% to 60%. We aimed to characterize major barriers to manuscript preparation, beyond lack of time, for academics from a broad range of specialties at a tertiary academic medical institution. We explored whether major barriers evolved with increasing publishing experience. Approach: We surveyed registrants of 12 noncompulsory workshops on scientific publishing (April 2009–November 2015). Survey respondents indicated how many of their coauthored papers were accepted for publication in peer-reviewed journals in the past 5 years and stated what they found most difficult about preparing a manuscript, other than lack of time. Two investigators performed a content analysis of the reported barriers; mean agreement between coders was 98% (SD = 2%), and the mean Scott π coefficient for interrater reliability was 0.81 (SD = 0.26). We used a multimethod analytic approach to determine whether the perceived barriers varied with level of publishing experience. Findings: Surveys were returned by 201 of 256 registrants (79%). Thirty-eight percent of respondents had lower publishing experience (0–4 papers published in peer-reviewed journals in the past 5 years), 26% had medium experience (5–10 papers), and 35% had higher experience (>10 papers). Many respondents (57%) listed multiple barriers, but 5% listed zero barriers. The content analysis of the 370 reported barrier items identified 8 categories covering 38 concepts. The most common concerns (i.e., organization, writing, following journal format, defining the article scope, disliking writing, responding to reviewers) were not affected by author experience level. However, significantly more academics with higher experience expressed concerns about data presentation. Insights: Academics commonly reported barriers such as uncertainty about how to organize content, difficulty with developing succinct text, and frustration about meeting journal-specific formatting requirements. Greater experience in scientific publishing did not appear to mitigate these barriers. Academic institutions can provide targeted support for persistent challenges to scholarly productivity. © 2019, © 2019 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

However, few studies have addressed how positive behaviors such as wellness and spirituality, in combination with these barriers, might affect empathy. Hypotheses: We hypothesized a negative relationship between psychological distress and empathy, and a positive relationship between empathy and wellness behaviors. We also hypothesized that openness to others' spirituality would moderate the effects of psychological distress on empathy in medical students. Method: This cross-sectional study included 106 medical students in a public medical school in the U.S. Midwest. Mailed questionnaires collected student information on specialty choice and sociodemographics, empathy, spirituality openness, religiosity, wellness, burnout, depression, anxiety, and stress. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted, with empathy as the dependent variable, psychological distress and all wellness behaviors as predictors, and spirituality openness as a moderator. Results: Specialty choice, burnout, wellness behaviors, spirituality openness, and religiosity were significant independent predictors of empathy. In addition, when added singly, one interaction was significant: Spirituality Openness × Depression. Spirituality openness was related to empathy only in nondepressed students. Empathy of students with higher levels of depression was generally lower and not affected by spirituality openness. Conclusions: Nondepressed students who reported lower openness to spirituality might benefit most from empathy training, because these students reported the lowest empathy. Highly depressed or disengaged students may require interventions before empathy can be addressed. In addition, burnout was related to lower levels of empathy and wellness was related to higher levels.

Medical educators have long expressed a desire to have indicators of medical student performance that have strong predictive validity. Predictors traditionally used fell into 4 general categories: demographic (e.g., gender), other background factors (e.g., college major), performance/aptitude (e.g., medical college admission test scores), and noncognitive factors (e.g., curiosity). These factors, however, have an inconsistent record of predicting student performance. In comparison to traditional predictive factors, we sought to determine the extent to which academic performance in the 1st-year of medical school, as measured by examination performance in the bottom quartile of the class in 7 required courses, predicted later performance on a variety of assessments, both knowledge based (e.g., United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 and Step IICK) and clinical skills based (e.g., clerkship grades and objective structured clinical exam performance). Of all predictors measured, number of appearances in the bottom quartile in Year 1 was the most strongly related to performance in knowledge-based assessments, as well as clinically related outcomes, and, for each outcome, bottom-quartile performance accounted for additional variance beyond that of the traditional predictors. Low academic performance in the 1st year of medical school is a meaningful risk factor with both predictive validity and predictive utility for low performance later in medical school. The question remains as to how we can incorporate this indicator into a system of formative assessment that effectively addresses the challenges of medical students once they have been identified. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85009736757"

It is deeply rooted in the premise that we can learn from our mistakes, thereby improving the care we provide. Recent advances in our understanding of medical error and quality improvement have challenged the value of traditional models of MMC. As a result the purpose of MMC has become clouded and ill-defined: Is it an educational conference that promotes mastery of clinical acumen, or is it a venue to drive quality improvement by addressing systems-based issues in delivering care? Or can it serve both purposes? Evidence: Review of the history of MMC, the literature, and critical application of education theory demonstrates the source of the confusion and the challenges in viewing it through the exclusive lens of either education or quality improvement. Application of experiential learning theory helps resolve this discord showing how the conference facilitates the development of clinical mastery while informing quality improvement programs about important and relevant systems-based issues. Implication: Building on this, we present a model for MMC involving five essential elements: case-based involving an adverse patient event, anonymity for participants, expert guided critical analysis, reframing understanding of the case presentation and related systems-based factors, and projection to practice change. This model builds on previously described models, is grounded in the literature, and helps clarify its role from both the educational and the quality improvement perspectives. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84974777189"

Intervention: New portfolio coaches participated in a multifaceted training program that included orienting modules, a 7.5-hr training workshop featuring analysis of reflective writing, an Observed Structured Teaching Exercise (OSTE), and subsequent longitudinal coaches’ meetings for timely task training. Four desired coaching skills were emphasized in the initial training: creating a safe environment, explicitly using performance data, asking questions that elicit reflection, and guiding the student to develop future goals and plans. We collected and analyzed several outcomes: (a) coaches’ self-assessment at key intervals, (b) open-ended written responses to three coaching vignettes, (c) video recordings of the OSTE, and (d) subsequent student evaluation of the coach. In an attempt to capture learning from the workshop, both the responses to written vignettes and the video-recorded encounters were coded for presence or absence of the four desired skills. Context: Our portfolio and coaching program was instituted as part of a major undergraduate medical education reform. A new cohort of 25 coaches is enrolled with each matriculating student class, and each coach is assigned to work individually with 8–10 students, forming a coaching relationship that continues over 4 years. Coaches are compensated at 5% full-time equivalent. Outcome: On coach self-assessment, the majority of coaches reported significant improvement in their perceived ability to assess a student's level of reflection, enhance reflection, use performance data, and guide a student to develop goals and plans. After two semesters, coach perception of improved abilities persisted. Students rated coaches as excellent (82%), reporting that coaches created safe environments (99%), promoted insight (92%), and aided in goal setting (97%). Written responses to vignettes before the OSTE found that several coaches omitted desired behaviors; however, posttraining responses showed no discernable pattern of learning. Coding of the OSTE, in contrast, documented that all coaches demonstrated all four of the desired skills. Lessons Learned: Although coaches reported learning related to key skills, learning was not apparent when responses to written vignettes were examined. In contrast, skills were demonstrated in the OSTE, perhaps due to the added structured tasks as well as anticipation of feedback. In conclusion, this portfolio coach training program achieved its desired aim of providing students with portfolio coaches who demonstrated the desired skills, as reported by both coaches and students. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014513326"

Purpose: Online medical education resources such as blogs are increasingly used by EM trainees and clinicians. However, quality evaluations of these resources using gestalt are unreliable. We investigated the reliability of two previously derived quality evaluation instruments for blogs. Approach: Sixty English-language EM websites that published clinically oriented blog posts between January 1 and February 24, 2016, were identified. A random number generator selected 10 websites, and the 2 most recent clinically oriented blog posts from each site were evaluated using gestalt, the Academic Life in Emergency Medicine (ALiEM) Approved Instructional Resources (AIR) score, and the Medical Education Translational Resources: Impact and Quality (METRIQ-8) score, by a sample of medical students, EM residents, and EM attendings. Each rater evaluated all 20 blog posts with gestalt and 15 of the 20 blog posts with the ALiEM AIR and METRIQ-8 scores. Pearson's correlations were calculated between the average scores for each metric. Single-measure intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) evaluated the reliability of each instrument. Results: Our study included 121 medical students, 88 EM residents, and 100 EM attendings who completed ratings. The average gestalt rating of each blog post correlated strongly with the average scores for ALiEM AIR (r =.94) and METRIQ-8 (r =.91). Single-measure ICCs were fair for gestalt (0.37, IQR 0.25–0.56), ALiEM AIR (0.41, IQR 0.29–0.60) and METRIQ-8 (0.40, IQR 0.28–0.59). Conclusion: The average scores of each blog post correlated strongly with gestalt ratings. However, neither ALiEM AIR nor METRIQ-8 showed higher reliability than gestalt. Improved reliability may be possible through rater training and instrument refinement. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041224692"

Prior literature describing the acculturation needs of IMGs focused primarily on communication content and style. We conducted a qualitative study to explore acculturation that might be specific to IMG residents who care for children. Approach: In a study conducted from November 2011 to April 2012, we performed four 90-minute semistructured focus groups with 26 pediatric IMG residents from 12 countries. The focus group transcripts were analyzed using open and focused coding methodology. Findings: The focus groups and subsequent analysis demonstrated that pediatric IMG residents' socialization to their home culture impacts their transition to practice in the United States; they must adjust not only to a U.S. culture, different from their own, but also to the culture of medicine in the United States. We identified the following new acculturation themes: understanding the education system and family structure, social determinants of health, communication with African American parents, contraception, physician handoffs, physicians' role in prevention, adolescent health, and physicians' role in child advocacy. We further highlight the acculturation challenges faced by pediatric IMG residents and offer brief recommendations for the creation of a deliberate acculturation curriculum for pediatric IMG residents. Insight: Residency training is a unique period in physicians' personal and professional development and can be particularly challenging for IMGs. There is a significant gap in the identified acculturation needs and the current curricula available to IMG residents who care for children. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007418291"

These goals are often not formally shared with those actually working with the learner in the clinical setting. Intervention: We developed a program of written, student-generated weekly learning goals in which students focused on processes of becoming better doctors for their patients. These goals were shared at the beginning of each week with students' clinical teams for feedback and incorporation into the work. Context: The weekly learning goals program was developed and implemented as part of a required 3rd-year neurology clerkship. At the end of each 4-week clerkship, students were asked to evaluate the program through an anonymous electronic survey utilizing quantitative and open-ended qualitative questions. Outcome: Seventy-six of 82 students completed the evaluation survey (93% response rate). Eighty-six percent reported that the weekly learning goals increased their awareness of their thoughts and actions. Seventy-eight percent reported that the learning goals helped to improve their clinical performance to some degree, and 57% reported that the learning goals increased their focus on patient care. Students described a greater sense of focus on self-assessment and accountability from their goals. Students often commented that engagement from attendings and residents regarding their goals was a key element for successful learning from their goals. Lessons Learned: Student-generated weekly learning goals on a neurology clerkship appear to be an effective method to operationalize SRL. For most students, the frequency of the goals allowed for close self-monitoring, and the act of sharing goals with the team opened a new avenue for dialogue between students and their supervisors. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994156965"

However, little is known about which tasks in objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) improve students' cognitive and metacognitive processes. Research is needed to support OSCE designs that benefit students' metacognitive strategies when they are studying, reinforcing a hypothesis-driven approach. With that intent, hypothesis-driven physical examination (HDPE) assessments ask students to elicit and interpret findings of the physical exam to reach a diagnosis (“Examine this patient with a painful shoulder to reach a diagnosis”). Hypotheses: When studying for HDPE, students will dedicate more time to hypothesis-driven discussions and practice than when studying for a part-task OSCE (“Perform the shoulder exam”). It is expected that the whole-task nature of HDPE will lead to a hypothesis-oriented use of the learning resources, a frequent use of adjustment strategies, and persistence with learning. Method: In a mixed-methods study, 40 medical students were randomly paired and filmed while studying together for two hypothetical OSCE stations. Each 25-min study period began with video cues asking to study for either a part-task OSCE or an HDPE. In a crossover design, sequences were randomized for OSCEs and contents (shoulder or spine). Time-on-task for discussions or practice were categorized as “hypothesis-driven” or “sequence of signs and maneuvers.” Content analysis of focus group interviews summarized students' perception of learning resources, adjustment strategies, and persistence with learning. Results: When studying for HDPE, students allocate significantly more time for hypothesis-driven discussions and practice. Students use resources contrasting diagnoses and report persistence with learning. When studying for part-task OSCEs, time-on-task is reversed, spent on rehearsing a sequence of signs and maneuvers. Conclusions: OSCEs with similar contents but different task demands lead to opposite learning strategies regarding how students manage their study time.

In addition, physician scientists are a needed and necessary part of the academic research environment but are dwindling in numbers. Intervention: In response to predictions of critical shortages of clinician investigators and the lack of proper preparation as undergraduates for these professions, the Biomedical Science (BMS) undergraduate major was created at The Ohio State University to attract incoming college freshmen with interests in scientific research and the healthcare professions. The intent of this major was to graduate an elite cohort of highly talented individuals who would pursue careers in the healthcare professions, biomedical research, or both. Context: Students were admitted to the BMS major through an application and interview process. Admitted cohorts were small, comprising 22 to 26 students, and received a high degree of individualized professional academic advising and mentoring. The curriculum included a minimum of 4 semesters (or 2 years) of supervised research experience designed to enable students to gain skills in clinical and basic science investigation. In addition to covering the prerequisites for medicine and advanced degrees in health professions, the integrated BMS coursework emphasized research literacy as well as skills related to work as a healthcare professional, with additional emphasis on independent learning, teamwork to solve complex problems, and both oral and written communication skills. Supported by Ohio State's Department of Internal Medicine, a unique clinical internship provided selected students with insights into potential careers as physician scientists. Outcome: In this educational case report, we describe the BMS undergraduate major and its outcomes after 10 years of implementation. Major outcomes include the strength of the major's matriculates (average ACT score = 32.6; average high school class percentile rank = 95.5) and the high percentage of BMS students who pursued graduate/professional degrees (91%; n = 110). Other markers of success include the strong focus on research, which resulted in 120 articles published by graduates to date (range = 0–12/student; 43% with at least 1 peer-reviewed journal article). Lessons Learned: Based on its successes, adoption of a similar program at other academic medical centers would help feed the pipeline of well-trained health professionals and biomedical researchers. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85035805663"

This is in part due to insufficient resources and supports but can also be attributed to a lack of adequate physician training in addressing the unique needs of this population. Intervention: This study aimed to introduce 1st-year medical students to the IDD population using a blended educational experience that included video narratives of and direct interactions with people affected by IDD. The goal of this intervention was to promote person-centered attitudes and communication among early medical trainees. Context: The study recruited 27 first-year medical students and randomly assigned each to 1 of 2 groups. The control group received an introductory video lecture about IDD healthcare, followed by a quiz. The narrative group received the same lecture, followed by reflective discussion of videos featuring people living with IDD sharing their perspectives and stories. All students then participated in 4 simulated clinical encounters with patient educators (PEs) who have lived experiences of IDD. Focus groups were conducted with students following the simulated encounters to explore their experiences and perceptions of this blended learning activity. Moreover, secondary quantitative data were collected to assess students' performance in the clinical encounters, along with self-reports of comfort, confidence, and competence of interacting with people with IDD (pre- and postparticipation). Outcome: All students thought that the blended educational experience was valuable and enjoyable, commenting on the importance of adaptable language and engagement of people with IDD, as well as the merits of reflecting on patient narratives. Students also discussed feelings of discomfort stemming from a lack of knowledge and previous exposure to IDD and how this discomfort might motivate them to learn more and develop their skills further. In addition, descriptive analyses revealed that students in the narrative group showed greater self-rated measures of comfort, confidence, and competence compared to control; they also had higher mean performance scores across all PE interview stations. Lessons Learned: PEs add a powerful real-life dimension to communication skills teaching and have been shown to be a valuable educational modality. Moreover, exposure to and reflection on video-based patient narratives are useful ways of teaching medical students about patients' lived experiences and promoting person-centered communication, both within and beyond IDD. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85039554861"

Inspired partially by the work of Stokes and other theorists in science and technology studies, we propose that discussions about compelling research in health professions education might be usefully advanced by considering what it would mean if the community framed itself as a knowledge-producing field instead of aligning itself with either disciplinary or practical interests. Evidence: Efforts to foreground disciplinary or practical interests in education research have been unproductive, leading to the privileging of one group's expertise at the expense of the other. Currently proposed principles and practices for responding to the divergence between these interests, such as knowledge translation or practitioner inquiry, have yielded comparatively little in the way of mutual satisfaction. Implications: As a field, health professions education research would not privilege either disciplinary or practical interests, nor would it attempt any sort of definitive blueprint for resolution to the tension. Rather it would regard these interests as inherently interconnected and, therefore, always in tension to varying degrees. The challenge for a field is not to resolve that tension but to harness it in productive ways through collaboration, negotiation, and compromise, through ever-shifting engagements that will not necessarily be comfortable but will nonetheless foster knowledge that resonates with all parts of the community. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038105693"

Medical educators should consider how institutional norms influence medical students' perceptions of implicit bias. Understanding normative structures in medical education can shed light on why this influence is associated with students' resistance to implicit bias. Evidence. Extant research across diverse fields of study uncovers and theorizes layers of norms and normative systems and how they are related to ethical behavior. This review bridges the fields of communication, bioethics, and medical education, constructing an organized foundation and common language by which researchers can build effective educational interventions. First, the nature and effects of implicit bias are described. Second, the nature of normative systems in medical education is explicated. Concepts from the fields of education and communication are transferred to medical education. Third, the structure of the communication of norms in medical education is revealed, through theoretical research in bioethics and empirical medical education research. Implications. Recommendations are provided for medical educators to improve activities intended to encourage reflection on implicit bias. These recommendations include reframing educational activities as endeavors in “personal” development and uncovering and transforming those normative structures that encourage resistance to implicit bias. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038125048"

The majority of these faculty are Assistant Professors with limited formal instruction in clinical teaching. Previous Divisional strategies to improve clinical teaching ability included discussion of effective teaching behaviors, developing written expectations for teaching faculty, and instituting seminars on effective clinical teaching. Heretofore, the Division had not utilized a direct observation exercise. Intervention: We developed a direct observation exercise to encourage discussion of teaching techniques and contemplation of change. Using a social learning model, we developed a peer-to-peer observation followed by a nonevaluative discussion. We created a tool for describing teaching behaviors in 5 domains that were similar to or different from the usual behavior of the observing peer: learner presentations, team leadership, bedside teaching, professionalism, and other. After the observation, the observing and observed faculty met to discuss observed teaching behaviors. Both faculty members discussed and then recorded any teaching behaviors that they planned to adopt or change. Context: We implemented this intervention in a 22-member Academic Division of Hospital Medicine at a tertiary care medical center in the United States. A high proportion were junior faculty and graduates of our residency program. Outcome: We reviewed records of 28 of 31 observations that were completed during the initial 9-month period of implementation and later surveyed faculty. The exercise resulted in planned changes in teaching behaviors that included instituting new methods to improve teaching team leadership, triaging of patients seen on rounds, faculty behaviors during oral presentations, giving real-time feedback, use of technology and humor, demonstrating physical examination findings, and modeling professional behaviors. Faculty later reported adoption of new teaching behaviors that were important to them. Lessons Learned: This exercise was easily implemented, resulted in planned changes by both observed and observing peers, and resulted in widespread adoption of some specific teaching behaviors. The most commonly planned change dealt with team leadership or organizational issues. When given the freedom to choose, junior faculty were more likely to observe senior faculty. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044211530"

Although many institutions have sought to more effectively assess and improve self-care in medical students, no self-care initiatives have been designed using the explicit perspectives of students themselves. Approach: Using concept mapping methodology, the research team created a student-generated taxonomy of self-care behaviors taken from a national sample of medical students in response to a brainstorming prompt. The research team examined how students’ conceptualizations of self-care may be organized into a framework suitable for use in programming and curricular change in medical education. Findings: Ten clusters of self-care activities were identified: nourishment, hygiene, intellectual and creative health, physical activity, spiritual care, balance and relaxation, time for loved ones, big picture goals, pleasure and outside activities, and hobbies. Using results of the two-dimensional scaling analysis, students’ individual self-care behaviors were organized within two orthogonal dimensions of self-care activities. Insights: This concept map of student-identified self-care activities provides a starting point for better understanding and ultimately improving medical student self-care. Students’ brainstormed responses fit within a framework of varying levels of social engagement and physical-psychological health that included a wide range of solitary, social, physical, and mental health behaviors. As students’ preferred self-care practices did not often include programmatic activities, medical educators may benefit from consulting this map as they plan new approaches to student self-care and in counseling individual students searching for more effective ways to ease the burdens of medical school. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013029059"

Medical education to address transgender-specific disparities is lacking. Research that engages transgender community members may help address health disparities by empowering patients, increasing trust, and informing medical curricula to increase competence. Approach: A 2015 Community Forum on Transgender Health Care was hosted at the University of Louisville School of Medicine, which included healthcare professionals and transgender community members to facilitate dialogue among mixed-participant groups using a World Café model. Fifty-nine participants discussed the status of transgender healthcare and made recommendations for local improvements. A follow-up survey was administered to 100 individuals, including forum participants and their referrals. The forum discussion and survey responses were analyzed to determine common perceptions of transgender healthcare, priorities for improvement interventions, and themes to inform curriculum. Findings: The community forum discussion showed that local transgender care is overwhelmingly underdeveloped and unresponsive to the needs of the transgender community. The follow-up survey revealed that priorities to improve transgender care included a multidisciplinary clinic for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) patients, an LGBT-friendly network of physicians, and more training for providers and support staff. This mutually constructive engagement experience influenced reform in undergraduate curricula and continuing education opportunities. Insights: Community engagement in healthcare disparities research can cultivate improbable discussions, yield innovative insight from marginalized populations, and build relationships with community members for future collaborations and interventions. Societal acceptance of transgender identities, which could be promoted through healthcare providers, could stimulate significant progress in transgender healthcare. Supplemental educational interventions for practicing physicians will improve the current conditions of transgender healthcare, but a comprehensive medical school curriculum specifically for transgender health that includes interactions between the transgender community and medical students could be particularly impactful. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85035811423"

Writing and interpreting DOM letters are challenging. There is heterogeneity in the letters that makes it difficult to both write and read these letters. Approach: The purpose of this study is to determine the value of new guidelines developed by a task force of clerkship directors and program directors in internal medicine and assess the implementation of these guidelines. The Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine performed a cross-sectional survey of internal medicine clerkship directors at U.S. and Canadian medical schools in 2014. In addition, the primary author's institution reviewed 1,347 DOM letters between 2012 and 2014 to assess the implementation of these guidelines. Findings: The survey response rate was 78%. DOM letter writers reported the guidelines were better, easier to implement, and more compatible with the purpose of DOM letters than previously. Most letter readers reported that letters using the guidelines were more credible. Writers of DOM letters in lower academic ranks rated the letters with guidelines higher in several domains than those in higher academic ranks. Readers of DOM letters in higher academic ranks rated the letters with guidelines higher in several domains than those in lower academic ranks. In the DOM letters examined, the odds of meeting each guideline increased with each additional year. However, for 3 guidelines there was an initial decline in adherence from 2012 to 2013 before increasing again in 2014—the recommended length, clerkship description, and detailed narrative guidelines. Letters solely written by a chair were less likely to incorporate the guidelines. Insights: Clerkship directors often write the DOM letters and identify with the purpose of the guidelines. As writers, lower ranking academic faculty value the guidelines more than higher ranking academic faculty. As readers of DOM letters, higher academic ranking faculty value letters that incorporate the guidelines more than lower academic ranking faculty. DOM letters implemented more guideline criteria since the guidelines were released. If implementing the guidelines, chairs should solicit the help of their clerkship director or educational representative when writing DOM letters. Although many clerkship directors read letters for their residency programs, additional program directors' opinions are needed. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045240465"

Unfortunately, mean test scores at the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Chicago (UIC) have historically been below the national average. Intervention: This retrospective and quasi-experimental mixed-methods study describes the development, evaluation, and effects of a student-initiated USMLE Step 1 preparatory program at UIC. The program provided second year students with First Aid for the USMLE Step 1 at the beginning of the academic year, as well as a six month subscription to the USMLE World question bank midyear. In addition, optional peer review sessions covering basic sciences and organ systems were taught by high-performing upperclassmen. The goals of the program were to raise mean USMLE Step 1 exam scores and increase the percentage of students passing the exam on their first time. Context: The program premiered during the 2012–13 academic year. Data from this cohort as well as four others (N = 830; 2010–2014 examinees) were gathered. Performances between preintervention (2010–12 examinees) and postintervention (2013–14 examinees) cohorts of students were compared. Focus groups and interviews with staff and students were conducted, recorded, and analyzed to investigate the impact that the program had on student interactions and perceptions of the learning environment. Outcome: There was a significant difference in exam performance pre- versus postintervention, with average USMLE Step 1 scores improving by 8.82 points following the implementation of the student-initiated program, t(5.61) = 828, p <.001. The average first-attempt pass rate also increased significantly by 8%, χ2(1) = 23.13, p <.001. Taking age, sex, Medical College Admission Test® scores, and undergraduate grade point average into account, students who participated in the program scored 6.57 points higher than students who did not participate in the program (R2 = 0.3), F(5, 886) = 76.71, p <.01, and had higher odds of passing USMLE Step 1 (odds ratio = 3.08, SE = 1.07, p <.01). Students and staff commented on the sense of community and empowerment the program created as well as the unique student-driven nature of the program. Lessons Learned: This study demonstrates the efficacy of a student-initiated curriculum and provides guidance for development and implementation of examination preparatory efforts at other institutions. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038119852"

Peer learning may be particularly useful in clinical learning environments, where students report feeling marginalized, overwhelmed, and unsupported. Educational interventions often fail in the workplace environment, as they are often conceived in the “ideal” rather than the complex, messy real world. This work sought to explore barriers and facilitators to implementing peer learning activities in a clinical curriculum. Approach: Previous peer learning research results and a matrix of empirically derived peer learning activities were presented to local clinical education experts to generate discussion around the realities of implementing such activities. Potential barriers and limitations of and strategies for implementing peer learning in clinical education were the focus of the individual interviews. Findings: Thematic analysis of the data identified three key considerations for real-world implementation of peer learning: culture, epistemic authority, and the primacy of patient-centered care. Strategies for peer learning implementation were also developed from themes within the data, focusing on developing a culture of safety in which peer learning could be undertaken, engaging both educators and students, and establishing expectations for the use of peer learning. Insights: This study identified considerations and strategies for the implementation of peer learning activities, which took into account both educator and student roles. Reported challenges were reflective of those identified within the literature. The resultant framework may aid others in anticipating implementation challenges. Further work is required to test the framework's application in other contexts and its effect on learner outcomes. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006944148"

In several studies, medical trainees report that the quality of faculty feedback is inadequate. Sociocultural barriers to feedback exchanges are further amplified in graduate and postgraduate medical education settings, where trainees serve as frontline providers of patient care. Factors that affect institutional feedback culture, enhance feedback seeking, acceptance, and bidirectional feedback warrant further exploration in these settings. Approach: Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, we sought to examine residents' perspectives on institutional factors that affect the quality of feedback, factors that influence receptivity to feedback, and quality and impact of faculty feedback. Four focus group discussions were conducted, with two investigators present at each. One facilitated the discussion, and the other observed the interactions and took field notes. We audiotaped and transcribed the discussions, and performed a thematic analysis. Measures to ensure rigor included thick descriptions, independent coding by two investigators, and attention to reflexivity. Findings: We identified five key themes, dominated by resident perceptions regarding the influence of institutional feedback culture. The theme labels are taken from direct participant quotes: (a) the cultural norm lacks clear expectations and messages around feedback, (b) the prevailing culture of niceness does not facilitate honest feedback, (c) bidirectional feedback is not part of the culture, (d) faculty–resident relationships impact credibility and receptivity to feedback, and (e) there is a need to establish a culture of longitudinal professional growth. Insights: Institutional culture could play a key role in influencing the quality, credibility, and acceptability of feedback. A polite culture promotes a positive learning environment but can be a barrier to honest feedback. Feedback initiatives focusing solely on techniques of feedback giving may not enhance meaningful feedback. Further research on factors that promote feedback seeking, receptivity to constructive feedback, and bidirectional feedback would provide valuable insights. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006922938"

Background: Previous research has demonstrated validity evidence for the mini-CEX, but most studies were carried out in internal medicine or single disciplines, therefore limiting generalizability of the findings. If the mini-CEX is to be used in multidisciplinary contexts, then validity evidence should be gathered in similar settings. The purpose of this study was to gather further validity evidence for the mini-CEX but in a broader context. Specifically we sought to explore the effects of discipline and rater type on mini-CEX scores, internal structure, and the relationship between mini-CEXs and OSCEs in a multidisciplinary context. Approach: During clerkship, medical students completed eight different rotations (family medicine, internal medicine, surgery, psychiatry, pediatrics, emergency, anesthesiology and obstetrics and gynecology). During each rotation, mini-CEX forms and a written examination were completed. Two multidisciplinary OSCEs (in Clerkship Year 3 and start of Year 4) assessed clinical skills. The reliability of the mini-CEX was assessed using Generalizability analyses. To assess the influence of discipline and rater type, mean scores were analyzed using a factorial analysis of variance. The total mini-CEX score was correlated to scores from the students' respective OSCEs and corresponding written exams. Results: Eighty-two students met inclusion criteria for a total of 781 ratings (average of 9.82 mini-CEX forms per student). There was a significant effect of discipline (p <.001, =.16), and faculty provided lower scores than nonfaculty raters (7.12 vs. 7.41; p =.002, =.02). The g-coefficient was.53 when discipline was included as a facet and.23 when rater type was a facet. There were low, but statistically significant correlations between the mini-CEX and scores for the 4th-year OSCE Total Score and the OSCE communication scores, r(80) =.40, p <.001 and r(80) =.29, p =.009. The mini-CEX was not correlated with the written examination scores for any of the disciplines. Conclusions: Our results provide conflicting findings for validity evidence for the mini-CEX. Mini-CEX ratings were correlated to multidisciplinary OSCEs but not written examinations, supporting the validity argument. However, reliability of the mini-CEX was low to moderate, and error accounted for the greatest amount of variability in scores. There was variation in scores due to discipline and resident raters gave higher scores than faculty. These results should be considered when considering the use of the mini-CEX in different contexts. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038112701"

Although many medical schools and residencies offer education electives or tracks focused on developing teaching skills, these programs often omit educational innovation, scholarship, and leadership and are narrowly targeted to one level of learner. Intervention: The University of California San Francisco created the Health Professions Education Pathway for medical students, residents, and fellows as well as learners from other health professional schools. The Pathway applies the theoretical framework of communities of practice in its curricular design to promote learner identity formation as future health professions educators. It employs the strategies of engagement, imagination, and alignment for identity formation. Context: Through course requirements, learners engage and work with members of the educator community of practice to develop the knowledge and skills required to participate in the community. Pathway instructors are faculty members who model a breadth of educator careers to help learners imagine personal trajectories. Last, learners complete mentored education projects, adopting scholarly methods and ethics to align with the broader educator community of practice. Outcome: From 2009 to 2014, 117 learners participated in the Pathway. Program evaluations, graduate surveys, and web-based searches revealed positive impacts on learner career development. Learners gained knowledge and skills for continued engagement with the educator community of practice, confirmed their career aspirations (imagination), joined an educator-in-training community (engagement/imagination), and disseminated via scholarly meetings and peer-reviewed publications (alignment). Lessons Learned: Learners identified engagement with the learner community as the most powerful aspect of the Pathway; it provided peer support for imagining and navigating the development of their dual identities in the clinician and educator communities of practice. Also important for learner success was alignment of their projects with the goals of the local educator community of practice. Our community of practice approach to educator career development has shown promising early outcomes by nurturing learners' passion for teaching; expanding their interest in educational leadership, innovation, and scholarship; and focusing on their identity formation as future educators. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994149415"

Background: Heuristics are cognitive shortcuts that may introduce bias and contribute to error. There is no standardized instrument available to quantify heuristic bias in clinical decision making, limiting future study of educational interventions designed to improve calibration of medical decisions. This study presents validity data to support a vignette-based instrument quantifying bias due to the anchoring, availability, and representativeness heuristics. Approach: Participants completed questionnaires requiring assignment of probabilities to potential outcomes of medical and nonmedical scenarios. The instrument randomly presented scenarios in one of two versions: Version A, encouraging heuristic bias, and Version B, worded neutrally. The primary outcome was the difference in probability judgments for Version A versus Version B scenario options. Results: Of 167 participants recruited, 139 enrolled. Participants assigned significantly higher mean probability values to Version A scenario options (M = 9.56, SD = 3.75) than Version B (M = 8.98, SD = 3.76), t(1801) = 3.27, p =.001.

Evidence: Community-based preceptors have traditionally served as volunteer, nonsalaried faculty, with academic institutions relying on intrinsic teaching rewards to sustain this model. However, increasing numbers of learners, the burdens of incorporating the electronic medical record in practice, and increasing demands for clinical productivity are making recruitment and retention of community-based preceptors more challenging. Implications: General challenges to engaging preceptors, as well as those unique to women's health, are discussed. Potential solutions are reviewed, including alternative recruitment strategies, faculty development to emphasize efficient teaching practices in the ambulatory setting, offers of online educational resources, and opportunities to incorporate students in value-added roles. Through examples cited in this review, clerkship directors and medical school administrators should have a solid foundation to actively engage their community-based preceptors. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044478734"

We sought to understand premedical student perspectives on an intensive resident shadowing experience. Approach: This was a qualitative study using anonymous data from focus groups conducted with premedical student participants in a month-long time motion analysis of internal medicine interns at two large academic medical centers. The authors convened, professionally transcribed verbatim, and analyzed data using step-by-step thematic analysis from 3 focus groups in 2012. Focus group questions included goals of participants, shadowing experiences, patient safety experiences, and thoughts on physician training. Findings: Twenty of the 22 students who were involved in the time motion study participated in the focus groups (91%). Three major themes were generated from the transcripts: qualities of a good physician, the inefficiencies of the healthcare system and the hospital, and the realities of graduate medical education. Insights: The intensive shadowing experience exposed premedical students to the hospital environment and many of the challenges they will face as future residents. Observing patient care firsthand, students considered the qualities of good intern physicians and appreciated the teamwork and collaboration essential to patient care in an academic medical center. Students witnessed some of the fundamental challenges of graduate medical training, including time pressures, documentation requirements, and the medical hierarchy. They also observed the difficulties of providing quality care in the current healthcare system, including hospital inefficiencies, interprofessional tensions, and financial barriers to care. Intensive shadowing of residents can begin the process of socialization to the culture of medicine by giving premedical students a realistic perspective of both positive and negative aspects of medical training and inpatient care. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041217293"

Findings: Students had considerable experience with active learning prior to medical school and conveyed accurate understanding of the concept and its major strategies. They appreciated the potential of active learning to deepen and broaden learning and its value for long-term professional development but had significant concerns about the efficiency of the process, the clarity of expectations provided, and the importance of receiving preparatory materials. Most significantly, active learning experiences were perceived as disconnected from grading and even as impeding preparation for school and national examinations.

We assumed that reflection and feedback on the team leadership process would advance the progression through leadership identity development stages in medical students within the context of classes using TBL. Intervention: This study is a quasi-experimental design with pretest–posttest control group. The pretest and posttest were reflection papers of medical students about their experience of leadership during their TBL sessions. In the intervention group, TBL and a team-based, guided reflection and feedback on the team leadership process were performed at the end of all TBL sessions. In the other group, only TBL was used. The Stata 12 software was used. Leadership Identity was treated both as a categorical and quantitative variable to control for differences in baseline and gender variables. Chi-square, t tests, and linear regression analysis were performed. Context: The population was a cohort of 2015–2016 medical students in a TBL setting at Tehran University of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine. Teams of four to seven students were formed by random sorting at the beginning of the academic year (intervention group n = 20 teams, control group n = 19 teams). Outcome: At baseline, most students in both groups were categorized in the Awareness and Exploration stage of leadership identity: 51 (52%) in the intervention group and 59 (55%) in the control group: uncorrected χ2(3) = 15.6, design-based F(2.83, 108) = 4.87, p =.003. In the posttest intervention group, 36 (36%) were in exploration, 33 (33%) were in L-identified, 20 (20%) were in Leadership Differentiated, and 10 (10%) were in the Generativity. None were in the Awareness or Integration stages. In the control group, 3 (20%) were in Awareness, 56 (53%) were in Exploration, 35 (33%) were in Leader Identified, 13 (12%) were in Leadership Differentiated. None were in the Generativity and Integration stages. Our hypothesis was supported by the data: uncorrected χ2(4) = 18.6, design-based F(3.77, 143) = 4.46, p =.002. The mean of the leadership identity in the pretest, intervention group equaled 1.93 (SD = 0.85) and the pretest, control group mean was 2.36 (SD = 0.86), p =.004. The mean of the posttest, intervention group was 3.04 (SD = 0.98) and posttest, control group mean was 2.54 (SD = 0.74), T = −4.00, design df = 38, p <.001, and adjusted on baseline and gender T = −8.97, design df = 38, p <.001. Lessons Learned: Reflection and feedback on the team leadership process in TBL advances the progression in stages of leadership identity development in medical students. Although the TBL strategy itself could have an impact on leadership identity development, this study demonstrates that when a reflection and feedback on leadership intervention are added, there is much greater impact. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026395449"

Intervention: Pathologists visited the gross anatomy laboratory 3 times throughout the 15-week course to assist medical students in determining the cause of death of the cadaver being dissected. Context: This intervention was implemented with 1st-semester medical students for 2 consecutive years (a total of 100 dissection teams consisting of 4 students in each team). Outcome: A quantitative content analysis was performed on the students' end of the course assignments to determine whether the students learned a greater percentage of pathologic information by having interactions with pathologists in the gross lab and to identify trends in the way medical students diagnosed their “first patient” (i.e., the cadaver). The students who had interactions with pathologists in the laboratory had significantly more pathology in their narrative than the students who did not receive pathologist interaction. They were also more likely to conclude that the cadaver they dissected actually died from a cause other than the one listed on the death certificate (18.3%; n = 15) compared to the students who had no pathologist interaction (1.8%; n = 2). A postintervention survey indicated that 65% of students felt that interaction with pathologists helped them understand the clinical application of gross anatomy, more than 40% become more interested in pathology, and 74% would have liked to have had more pathologist interaction. Lessons Learned: This intervention demonstrated a way to increase pathologist interaction within the undergraduate medical curriculum and enhance the educational environment of the gross anatomy laboratory. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84975099884"

Social network analysis explores interrelationships between people in groups by measuring the strength of connection between all possible pairs in a given network. Social network analysis has rarely been used to examine network connections among members in an academic medical society. This study seeks to ascertain the strength of connection between program directors in the Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine (APDIM) and its Education Innovations Project subgroup and to examine possible associations between connectedness and characteristics of program directors and programs. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that connectedness will be measurable within a large academic medical society and will vary significantly for program directors with certain measurable characteristics (e.g., age, gender, rank, location, burnout levels, desire to resign). Method: APDIM program directors described levels of connectedness to one another on the 2012 APDIM survey. Using social network analysis, we ascertained program director connectedness by measuring out-degree centrality, in-degree centrality, and eigenvector centrality, all common measures of connectedness. Results: Higher centrality was associated with completion of the APDIM survey, being in a university-based program, Educational Innovations Project participation, and higher academic rank. Centrality did not vary by gender; international medical graduate status; previous chief resident status; program region; or levels of reported program director burnout, callousness, or desire to resign. Conclusions: In this social network analysis of program directors within a large academic medical society, we found that connectedness was related to higher academic rank and certain program characteristics but not to other program director characteristics like gender or international medical graduate status. Further research is needed to optimize our understanding of connection in organizations such as these and to determine which strategies promote valuable connections. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044323970"

MEDPREP, a postbaccalaureate medical school preparatory program for socioeconomically disadvantaged or underrepresented in medicine students, has a stated mission to increase the numbers of physicians from minority or disadvantaged backgrounds and physicians working with underserved populations. This study aims to determine how MEDPREP enhances U.S. physician diversity and practice within underserved communities. Intervention: MEDPREP recruits disadvantaged and underrepresented in medicine students to complete a 2-year academic enhancement program that includes science coursework, standardized test preparation, study/time management training, and emphasis on professional development. Five hundred twenty-five disadvantaged or underrepresented students over 15 years completed MEDPREP and were tracked through entry into medical practice. Context: MEDPREP accepts up to 36 students per year, with two thirds coming from the Midwest region and another 20% from nearby states in the South. Students complete science, test preparation, academic enhancement, and professionalism coursework taught predominantly by MEDPREP faculty on the Southern Illinois University Carbondale campus. Students apply broadly to medical schools in the region and nation but are also offered direct entry into our School of Medicine upon meeting articulation program requirements. Outcome: Seventy-nine percent of students completing MEDPREP became practicing physicians. Fifty-eight percent attended public medical schools, and 62% attended medical schools in the Midwest. Fifty-three percent of program alumni chose primary care specialties compared to 34% of U.S. physicians, and MEDPREP alumni were 2.7 times more likely to work in medically underserved areas than physicians nationally. Lessons Learned: MEDPREP increases the number of disadvantaged and underrepresented students entering and graduating from medical school, choosing primary care specialties, and working in medically underserved areas. MEDPREP may therefore serve as a model for increasing physician diversity and addressing the needs of medically underserved communities. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014547634"

Background: Notes written in EHRs have generated criticism for being unnecessarily long and redundant, perpetuating inaccuracy and obscuring providers' clinical reasoning. Available assessment tools either focus on outpatient progress notes or require chart review by raters to develop familiarity with the patient. Approach: We used medical literature, local expert review, and attending focus groups to develop and refine an instrument to evaluate inpatient progress notes. We measured interrater reliability and scored the selected-response elements of the checklist for a sample of 100 progress notes written by PGY-1 trainees on the general medicine service. Results: We developed an instrument with 18 selected-response items and four open-ended items to measure the quality of inpatient progress notes written in the EHR. The mean Cohen's kappa coefficient demonstrated good agreement at.67. The mean note score was 66.9% of maximum possible points (SD = 10.6, range = 34.4%–93.3%). Conclusions: We present validity evidence in the domains of content, internal structure, and response process for a new checklist for rating inpatient progress notes. The scored checklist can be completed in approximately 7 minutes by a rater who is not familiar with the patient and can be done without extensive chart review. We further demonstrate that trainee notes show substantial room for improvement. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019203054"

It notes a shift from an era of altruism within which the medical professional was a ‘pillar of society’ always ‘on duty’ and always concerned foremost for the patient to an era in which he/she is just another member of the work force, subject to public scrutiny and criticism, to patient autonomy and to a self-serving ethos which characterizes the present age. Whilst concerns have been raised for a continuing and separate morality of medicine, young professionals in other studies have cited a range of characteristics including honesty, trustworthiness and respect alongside competence and medical skill. However, the notion of ‘performance’ has made a strong thrust into the literature, with students citing the putting on and taking off of dual personae as part of their complex identity in this present time. They are entitled to their own lives, to drop the act and just be themselves when off duty, picking it back up again with the duty call. Approach: The present study then investigated the views on this subject of two groups of medical students in Trinidad & Tobago in the Caribbean, one made up entirely of nationals and one including students from other parts of the Caribbean and the USA. They discussed the topic in focus groups of eight; their responses were then analysed thematically and subject to discourse analysis. Findings: The study revealed diverse attitudes with some embracing the ethical standards of a high calling that whilst others were concerned that too much was expected, that they had a right to break free and be themselves as long as they did not transgress too far from their expected roles. There were two distinct groups both concerned with ‘how’ they ’carried themselves about’ but this meant different things to each dependent on which of the two perspectives they embraced. As a whole, the study revealed an ongoing conflict of value systems with concern for patient welfare just remaining uppermost. Insights: As The University of the West Indies has now stepped into the field of medical professionalism actively it would hope to support students in resolving their conflicts more consciously in response to the range of philosophical stances which currently present themselves. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978971630"

Yet, faculty may lack the skills and mentorship needed to successfully complete projects. In addition, many educators feel undervalued. Intervention: To reinvigorate our school's educational mission, the Institute for Excellence in Education (IEE) was created. Here we focus on one of the IEE's strategic goals, that of inspiring and supporting educational research, scholarship, and innovation. Context: Using the 6-step curriculum development process as a framework, we describe the development and outcomes of IEE programs aimed at enabling educational scholarship at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Outcome: Four significant programs that focused on educational scholarship were developed and implemented: (a) an annual conference, (b) a Faculty Education Scholars' Program, (c) “Shark Tank” small-grant program, and (d) Residency Redesign Challenge grants. A diverse group of primarily junior faculty engaged in these programs with strong mentorship, successfully completing and disseminating projects. Faculty members have been able to clarify their personal goals and develop a greater sense of self-efficacy for their desired paths in teaching and educational research. Lessons Learned: Faculty require programs and resources for educational scholarship and career development, focused on skills building in methodology, assessment, and statistical analysis. Mentoring and the time to work on projects are critical. Key to the IEE's success in maintaining and building programs has been ongoing needs assessment of faculty and learners and a strong partnership with our school's fund-raising staff. The IEE will next try to expand opportunities by adding additional mentoring capacity and further devilment of our small-grants programs. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026352450"

Although longitudinal integrative clerkships increase continuity and are associated with improved student and preceptor experience, they require schoolwide curricular reform. Alternative innovations enhancing student–preceptor relationships within the constraints of a traditional block clerkship may demonstrate similar benefits. Intervention: We piloted a continuity-enhanced general pediatric ambulatory schedule during 2 consecutive clerkship blocks in 2013. Students in the continuity-enhanced model (n = 29) were assigned 1–3 primary clinic preceptors, whereas those in the traditional model (n = 30) worked with 5–8. Data were gathered from student assessments and anonymous student and preceptor surveys. We used t and Fisher's exact tests to compare the two groups and performed thematic analysis of free-text survey comments. Context: Our school utilizes a block clerkship model with approximately 30 students rotating through the pediatric clerkship every 8 weeks. During the 3-week ambulatory portion, students spend 8 half days in the general pediatric ambulatory clinic. At the conclusion of each clinic, attendings completed brief student evaluation cards. Traditionally, student and attending schedules were created independently, resulting in transient supervisory relationships and dissatisfaction with clinical engagement, feedback, and evaluation. Outcome: Seventy-three percent (43/59) of the students completed the survey. Ten general ambulatory attendings collectively completed 87.5% (35/40) of the monthly surveys. Continuity students received significantly more narrative evaluation comments (10.6 vs. 5.8, p <. 001) from general ambulatory clinic attendings and were more likely to have at least one general ambulatory clinic attending endorse being able to provide meaningful feedback and evaluation (n = 29, 100% vs. n = 20, 66.7%, p <. 001). Continuity students were also more likely to endorse being able to ask at least one of these attendings for a letter of recommendation (71.4% vs. 9.1%, p <. 001) and to have at least one general ambulatory clinic attending endorse being able to provide a meaningful letter of recommendation if asked (62.1% vs. 3.3%, p <. 001). Students (88.4%) and attendings (85.7%) preferred the continuity-enhanced schedule. The most frequent theme of both student and attending free-text survey remarks were relationships and assessment. Lessons Learned: Intentional scheduling of clerkship students to enhance preceptor continuity resulted in significant positive outcomes echoing the relationship-based educational benefits of longitudinal clerkships, particularly in regards to student assessment and feedback. Clerkship directors and other medical educators should consider implementing small changes within block clerkships to maximize student–preceptor continuity. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041106083"

More rigorous evaluation of early IPE is needed to determine its impact on teaching interprofessional collaborative practice and providing a solid foundation for applying collaborative skills in the clinical environment. Intervention: First-year students (N = 679) in 7 health professions programs participated in a 4-session series focusing on professional roles and responsibilities, teams and teamwork, and the healthcare system. Interprofessional teams of 5–6 students, from at least 3 professions, were assembled for the duration of the series and created a team charter during their first session to guide their work. Each subsequent session included a brief lecture and interactive exercises. Faculty facilitators from the participating programs provided support to students during the sessions. As a culminating project, each team created a short video depicting a barrier to interprofessional collaboration. Students evaluated the performance of their team members using a web-based peer assessment survey. A course evaluation with an embedded validated attitudinal scale was used to assess changes in student perceptions about IPE. A sample of videos were also scored by 2 faculty using a rubric linked to course expectations. Context: This educational offering took place on the health sciences campus of a large, mid-Atlantic research university with more than 3,200 clinical learners in schools of allied health professions, dentistry, medicine, nursing, and pharmacy. It was the first interprofessional activity for most of the learners. Outcome: There were 555 students who participated in some or all of the sessions. Comments indicated that students enjoyed interacting with their peers and prefer activities allowing them to apply content to their profession over lectures. The assessment measures revealed a disconnect between student ratings targeting interprofessional socialization and faculty ratings targeting the products of their teamwork. Although students provided positive feedback to their teammates through peer assessment, and the attitudinal scale showed a small but significant increase in positive attitudes toward IPE, the videos they created did not demonstrate a deep understanding of barriers to interprofessional practice. Lessons Learned: This large-scale IPE activity for early learners supported progress toward interprofessional socialization, but student learning was inconsistently demonstrated in teamwork products. Course planners should augment self- and peer-reported interprofessional socialization measures with faculty-generated behavioral outcome assessments. Such triangulation produces a more robust data set to inform decisions about curricular revisions and development. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014766959"

Background: There is a relative dearth of studies on the correlations between undergraduate OSCE scores and future exam performance within either undergraduate or graduate medical education and almost none on linking these simulated encounters to eventual patient care. Of the research studies that do correlate clerkship OSCE scores with future performance, these often have a small sample size and/or include only 1 clerkship. Approach: Students in USU graduating classes of 2007 through 2011 participated in the study. We investigated correlations between clerkship OSCE grades with United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 2 Clinical Knowledge, Clinical Skills, and Step 3 Exams scores as well as Postgraduate Year 1 program director's evaluation scores on Medical Expertise and Professionalism. We also conducted contingency table analysis to examine the associations between poor performance on clerkship OSCEs with failing Step 3 and receiving poor program director ratings. Results: The correlation coefficients were weak between the clerkship OSCE grades and the outcomes. The strongest correlations existed between the clerkship OSCE grades and the Step 2 CS Integrated Clinical Encounter component score, Step 2 Clinical Skills, and Step 3 scores. Contingency table associations between poor performances on both clerkships OSCEs and poor Postgraduate Year 1 Program Director ratings were significant. Conclusions: The results of this study provide additional but limited validity evidence for the use of OSCEs during clinical clerkships given their associations with subsequent performance measures. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014520960"

Consequently, integration of leadership into medical school curriculum is becoming a priority. This raises the question of the appropriate context, timing, and pedagogy for conveying this competency to medical students. Intervention: Our program introduced a 1-week leadership course grounded in business pedagogy to Year 1 medical students. The curriculum centred on four themes: (a) Understanding Change, (b) Effective Teamwork, (c) Leading in Patient Safety, and (d) Leadership in Action. Post-curriculum qualitative student feedback was analyzed for insight into student satisfaction and attitude towards the leadership course content. Context: The Undergraduate Medical Education program of the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, is delivered over 4 years across 2 campuses in London and Windsor, Ontario, Canada. Course structure moved from traditional passive lectures to established business pedagogy, which involves active engagement in modules, case-based discussions, insights from guest speakers, and personal reflection. Outcome: A student-led survey evaluated student opinion regarding the leadership course content. Students valued career development reading materials and insights from guest speakers working in healthcare teams. Students did not relate to messages from speakers in senior healthcare leadership positions. Course scheduling late in the second semester was viewed negatively. Overall student opinion suggested that the 1-week course was suboptimal for establishing leadership principles and translated business pedagogy was ineffective in this context. Lessons Learned: Leadership curriculum in Undergraduate Medical Education should be grounded in a healthcare context relevant to the student's stage of training. Student engagement may be better supported if leadership is framed as a competency throughout their career. Schools considering such innovations could draw lessons from other professional schools and utilize material and faculty that resonate with students. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994164647"

Various conceptions about learning in either the classroom or the workplace exist among stakeholders, yet little is known about their conceptions of the transfer of learning between both settings. This study explored stakeholders' conceptions about transfer of learning between classroom-based learning and workplace practice. Approach: Homogeneous focus groups with students, medical teachers, and workplace supervisors were conducted using a constructivist grounded theory approach. Findings: The 54 participants' conceptions mainly related to their beliefs about who was responsible for (a) preparing for transfer of learning, (b) being at the workplace and connecting back to classroom-based learning, and (c) reflecting on transfer of learning and continuing the process. A continuum was recognized between those who held medical teachers/workplace supervisors responsible and those who held students responsible. Insights: There appears to be a variety of conceptions about who is responsible for enabling the transfer process. These conceptions may influence learning and instructional activities. Hence, it may be necessary to make these beliefs explicit in order to better align stakeholders' conceptions. To this end, the conceptual framework created in this study may be a useful tool. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026423699"

Intervention: In 2006, we implemented the national Educational Scholars Program to offer faculty development in educational scholarship for early career educators in pediatrics. We aimed to provide them with skills, experience, and initial success in educational scholarship and dissemination. The 3-year curriculum is delivered in interactive sessions at the annual pediatric academic meetings and online intersession modules. Curriculum content progresses from educational scholarship and implementing scholarly projects to dissemination and professional networking. Intersession modules address project planning, building an educator portfolio, reviewing the literature, using technology, authorship, and peer review. Concurrently, all scholars must complete a mentored educational project and demonstrate national dissemination of a peer-reviewed product to obtain a Certificate of Excellence in Educational Scholarship. Context: The setting of this study was a national, longitudinal, cohort-based faculty development program built within the Academic Pediatric Association, a 2,000-member professional organization. Outcome: In 10 years, the Educational Scholars Program has enrolled 172 scholars in 8 cohorts; 94 have graduated so far. We describe how formative evaluation guided curriculum refinement and process improvement. Summative evaluations show that faculty and scholars were satisfied with the program. Participant outcomes from Cohort 1, assessed at Kirkpatrick's four levels of evaluation, demonstrate increases in scholarly productivity, leadership activities, and academic promotions. Lessons Learned: Curriculum building is a dynamic process of ongoing evaluation and modification. Our program benefited from designing an integrated and focused curriculum, developing educational principles to guide program improvements, creating curricular tools to help learners organize and document their efforts, supporting project-based learning with expert mentoring, and facilitating peer and faculty networking and collaboration. A national, longitudinal faculty development program can support growth in academic knowledge and skills, promote professional networking, and thereby enrich educators' career opportunities. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014540793"

The authors sought to characterize recent trends in primary care interest and career trajectories among medical students at an academic medical institution that did not have a family medicine department. Approach: Match data for 2,477 graduates who matched into resident training programs between 1989 and 2014 were analyzed to determine the proportion entering primary care residency programs. An online search and confirmatory phone call methodology was used to determine primary care career trajectories for the 795 graduates who matched into primary care residency programs between 1989 to 2010. Subanalyses were performed to characterize primary care career entrance among graduates who matched into the three primary care residency programs: Family Medicine, Categorical and Primary Care Internal Medicine, and Categorical and Primary Care Pediatrics. Findings: Between 1989 and 2014, 911 (37%) of all matched graduates matched into primary care residency programs. Of the 795 graduates who matched into these programs between 1989 and 2010, less than half (245; 31%) entered primary care careers. Of the graduates who ultimately entered primary care careers, 82% matched into either internal medicine or pediatrics residency programs and 18% matched into family medicine programs. Although there have been fluctuations in primary care interest that seem to parallel health care trends over the 26-year period, the overall percentage of graduates entering primary care residency programs and careers has remained fairly stable. Between 2006 and 2010, entrance into both primary care residency programs and primary care careers steadily increased. Despite this, the overall percentage of matched graduates who entered primary care careers over the 22-year study period (12%) was less than the national average (16%–18%). Insights: In the 26-year period between 1989 and 2014, primary care career interest increased slightly among medical students at this academic medical institution, with fluctuations that seem to coincide with national health care trends. Year-to-year fluctuations appear to be driven by rising numbers of Categorical Pediatrics and Categorical Internal Medicine matchers pursuing careers in primary care. There may be a need for specialized curricula and strategies to promote and retain interest in primary care at academic medical institutions, especially at institutions without family medicine training programs. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84980006575"

Existing research demonstrates that physicians of all levels are unreliable self-assessors. This poses a concern in medical practice, which requires continuous updates to clinical competencies and awareness of personal limitations. Few published studies examine graduate medical education curricula designed to develop self-assessment skills. Intervention: Conceptual models, such as self-determination theory, suggest that self-assessment is most effectively learned through reflective processes. The Family Medicine Residency Program at Lehigh Valley Health Network developed a learner-centered competency assessment process that integrates advising and performance review. The multisource, observable behavior-based process encourages conversation between resident and advisor. Utilizing feedback from clinical preceptors and patient surveys, advisors guide residents in determining individual learning needs in core competency areas, including relationship-centered care. Development of medical learners' capacity to form relationships is one means to improving the patient experience. Context: This retrospective case study evaluates the accuracy of senior residents' self-assessment in relationship-centered care compared with that of junior residents. The study population includes the 34 residents enrolled from AY 2009–2012. Data sets represent specific 6-month periods and have 3 component scores—Self, Faculty, and Patient—which were triangulated to determine concordance rates by postgraduate year level. Outcome: The concordance rate among first-years was 26.7%, whereas third-years saw 60.0% concordance. A discordance analysis found the Patient score most often deviated from the other 2 scores, whereas the Faculty score was never the sole dissenter. When all 3 scores differed, the Self score frequently fell between the other 2 scores. Lessons Learned: The principles of self-determination theory provide a valuable framework for understanding the development of residents' intrinsic motivation to become lifelong learners. The trend in improved concordance rates among senior residents suggests that prompting learners to triangulate feedback from multiple sources can lead to a shift in perspective about competency. Further study is needed to determine whether our results are generalizable to other competencies and educational settings. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006867194"

GHE is also no longer limited to students from high-income countries (HICs). However, it is unknown whether the motivations and experiences of medical students from HICs and from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) participating in GHE clinical electives through institutional partnerships are similar or different. Such an understanding is needed to design programs that meet the needs of participants and effectively train them in the principles and practice of global health. Approach: This was a cross-sectional, mixed-methods survey of LMIC students from partner sites rotating at one U.S. medical school, and U.S. students from one medical school rotating at partner sites, between 2010 and 2015. Variables included demographic characteristics of participants, components of the curriculum at the home institution, and components of the away rotation, including perceptions of its content and impact. Content analysis was used to identify themes in the responses provided to open-ended questions. Findings: In all, 63 of 84 (75%) LMIC and 61 of 152 (40%) U.S. students participated. Recall of predeparture training was low for both LMIC and U.S. students (44% and 55%, respectively). Opportunities to experience different healthcare systems, resource-different settings, and cultural exposure emerged as motivators for both groups. Both groups noted differences in doctor–patient relationships, interactions between colleagues, and use of diagnostic testing. U.S. respondents were more likely to perceive differences in the impact of social determinants of health and ethical issues. Both groups felt that their experience affected their interactions with patients and perspectives on education, but U.S. students were more likely to mention perspectives on healthcare delivery and social determinants of health, whereas LMIC respondents noted impacts on career goals. Insights: These results argue that GHE is not restricted to resource-constrained settings and that students from LMICs have similar reasons for participation as those from HICs. LMIC students also identified a lack of emphasis on GHE topics like social determinants of health during GH electives, which could diminish the effectiveness of these experiences. Both U.S. and LMIC students emphasized the cultural component of their GHE experience but had different perceptions regarding core tenets of GHE, such as the social determinants of health and health equity, during these experiences. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038107829"

However, the cognitive and strategic aspects of students' approaches to managing this situation have not been explored. Without an understanding of how students approach the question and answer activity, medical educators are unable to appreciate how effectively this activity fulfills their purposes of assessment or determine the activity's associated educational effects. Approach: A convenience sample of nine 4th-year medical students participated in semistructured one-on-one interviews exploring their approaches to managing situations in which they have been challenged with questions from preceptors to which they do not know the answer. Through an iterative and recursive analytic reading of the interview transcripts, data were coded and organized to identify themes relevant to the students' considerations in answering such questions. Findings: Students articulated deliberate strategies for managing the directed questioning activity, which at times focused on the optimization of their learning but always included considerations of image management. Managing image involved projecting not only being knowledgeable but also being teachable. The students indicated that their considerations in selecting an appropriate strategy in a given situation involved their perceptions of their preceptors' intentions and preferences as well as several contextual factors. Insights: The medical students we interviewed were quite sophisticated in their understanding of the social nuances of the directed questioning process and described a variety of contextually invoked strategies to manage the situation and maintain a positive image. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84982306256"

A supportive learning environment contributes to student well-being and enhances student empathy, professionalism, and academic success, whereas an unsupportive learning environment may lead to burnout, exhaustion, and cynicism. Student perceptions of the medical school learning environment may change over time and be associated with students' year of training and may differ significantly depending on the student's gender or race/ethnicity. Understanding the changes in perceptions of the learning environment related to student characteristics and year of training could inform interventions that facilitate positive experiences in undergraduate medical education. Approach: The Medical School Learning Environment Survey (MSLES) was administered to 4,262 students who matriculated at one of 23 U.S. and Canadian medical schools in 2010 and 2011. Students completed the survey at the end of each year of medical school as part of a battery of surveys in the Learning Environment Study. A mixed-effects longitudinal model, t tests, Cohen's d effect size, and analysis of variance assessed the relationship between MSLES score, year of training, and demographic variables. Findings: After controlling for gender, race/ethnicity, and school, students reported worsening perceptions toward the medical school learning environment, with the worst perceptions in the 3rd year of medical school as students begin their clinical experiences, and some recovery in the 4th year after Match Day. The drop in MSLES scores associated with the transition to the clinical learning environment (−0.26 point drop in addition to yearly change, effect size = 0.52, p <.0001) is more than 3 times greater than the drop between the 1st and 2nd year (0.07 points, effect size = 0.14, p <.0001). The largest declines were from items related to work–life balance and informal student relationships. There was some, but not complete, recovery in perceptions of the medical school learning environment in the 4th year. Insights: Perceptions of the medical school learning environment worsen as students continue through medical school, with a stronger decline in perception scores as students' transition to the clinical learning environment. Students reported the greatest drop in finding time for outside activities and students helping one another in the 3rd year. Perceptions differed based on gender and race/ethnicity. Future studies should investigate the specific features of medical schools that contribute most significantly to student perceptions of the medical school learning environment, both positive and negative, to pinpoint potential interventions and improvements. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015620676"

Various attitudes and interpersonal orientations including empathy and patient-centeredness have been posited to translate into behaviors constituting humanistic care. Background: To our knowledge there has never been a longitudinal, multi-institutional empirical study of the attitudinal and interpersonal orientations correlated with GHHS membership status. Approach: We used the American Medical Association Learning Environment Study (LES) data set to explore attitudinal correlates associated with students whose behaviors are recognized by their peers as being exceptionally humanistic. Specifically, we examined whether empathy, patient-centeredness, tolerance of ambiguity, coping style, and perceptions of the learning environment are associated with GHHS membership status. We further considered to what extent GHHS members arrive in medical school with these attitudinal correlates and to what extent they change and evolve differentially among GHHS members compared to their non-GHHS peers. Between 2011 and 2015, 585 students from 13 North American medical schools with GHHS chapters participated in the LES, a longitudinal cohort study using a battery of validated psychometric measures including the Jefferson Scale of Empathy, Patient-Practitioner Orientation Scale and Tolerance of Ambiguity Questionnaire. In the final survey administration, students self-identified as GHHS inductees or not (non-GHHS). T tests, effect sizes, and longitudinal generalized mixed-effects models examined the differences between GHHS and non-GHHS students. Results: Students inducted into GHHS scored significantly higher on average over 4 years than non-GHHS inductees on clinical empathy, patient-centered beliefs, and tolerance of ambiguity. GHHS students reported higher levels of empathy and patient-centeredness at medical school matriculation. This difference persists in the 4th year of medical school and when controlling for time, race, gender, and school. Conclusions: GHHS inductees enter medical school with different attitudes and beliefs than their non-GHHS classmates. Although humanistic attitudes and beliefs vary over time during students' 4 years, the gap between the two groups remains constant. Medical schools may want to consider selecting for specific humanistic traits during admissions as well as fostering the development of humanism through curricular interventions. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040998826"

Hypotheses: Hypothesis 1a: The virtues of Mindfulness, Empathic Compassion, and Generosity will be positively associated with one another (convergent validity). Hypothesis 1b: The virtues of Mindfulness and Empathic Compassion will explain variance in the action-related virtue of Generosity beyond that predicted by Big Five personality traits alone (discriminant validity). Hypothesis 1c: Virtuous students will experience greater well-being (“flourishing”), as measured by four indices of well-being: life meaning, life satisfaction, vocational identity, and vocational calling (predictive validity). Hypothesis 1d: Students who self-report higher levels of the virtues will be nominated by their peers for the Gold Humanism Award (predictive validity). Hypothesis 2a–2c: Neuroticism and Burnout will be positively associated with each other and inversely associated with measures of virtue and well-being. Method: The authors used data from a 2011 nationally representative sample of U.S. medical students (n = 499) in which medical virtues (Mindfulness, Empathic Compassion, and Generosity) were measured using scales adapted from existing instruments with validity evidence. Results: Supporting the predictive validity of the model, virtuous students were recognized by their peers to be exemplary doctors, and they were more likely to have higher ratings on measures of student well-being. Supporting the discriminant validity of the model, virtues predicted prosocial behavior (Generosity) more than personality traits alone, and students higher in the virtue of Mindfulness were less likely to be high in Neuroticism and Burnout. Conclusions: Data from this descriptive-correlational study offered additional support for the validity of the moral intuitionist model of virtuous caring. Applied to medical character education, medical school programs should consider designing educational experiences that intentionally emphasize the cultivation of virtue. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041140328"

Background: The Narrative Letter of Recommendation is a frequently used tool in the residency admissions process even though it has poor interrater reliability, lacks pertinent content, and does not correlate with residency performance. A newer tool, the Standardized Letter, has shown validity evidence for content and interrater reliability in other specialties. We sought to develop and provide validity evidence for the standardized Assessment Letter for Pediatrics. Approach: All 2012 and 2013 applicants invited to interview at the University of Geneva Pediatrics Residency Program provided 2 standardized Assessment Letters. Content for the letter was based on CanMEDS roles and ratings of 6 desired competencies and an overall assessment. Validity evidence was gathered for internal structure (Cronbach's alpha and generalizability), response process (interrater reliability with intraclass correlation), relations to other variables (Pearson's correlation coefficient), and consequences (logistic regression to predict admission). Results: One hundred fourteen faculty completed 142 standardized Assessment Letters for 71 applicants. Average overall assessment was 3.0 of 4 (SD = 0.59). Cronbach's alpha was 0.93. The G-coefficient was 0.59. The decision study projected that four Assessment Letters are needed to attain a G-coefficient of 0.73. Applicant variance (28.5%) indicated high applicant differentiation. The Assessment Letter intraclass coefficient was 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.43, 0.59]. Assessment Letter scores were correlated with the structured interview (r =.28), 95% CI [0.05, 0.51]; global rating (r =.36), 95% CI [0.13, 0.58]; and admissions decision (r =.25), 95% CI [0.02, 0.46]. Assessment Letter scores did not predict the admissions decision (odds ratio = 1.67, p =.37) after controlling for the unique contribution of the structured interview and global rating scores. Conclusion: Validity evidence supports use of the Assessment Letter for Pediatrics; future studies should refine items to improve predictive validity and explore how to best integrate the Assessment Letter into the residency admissions process. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85035767300"

Intervention: In 2012, a required educational session was developed for 1st-year medical students on social media and professional identity. Objectives include identifying professionalism issues and recognizing positive social media use. The 2-hour large-group session uses student-generated social media examples to stimulate discussion and concludes with an expert panel. Students complete a postsession reflection assignment. Context: The required social media session occurs early in the 1st year and is part of the Professionalism curriculum in The George Washington University School of Medicine. Reflection papers are graded for completion. Outcome: The study began in 2012 and ran through 2014; a total of 313/505 participants (62%) volunteered for the study. Assessment occurred through qualitative analysis of students' reflection assignments. Most students (65%, 203/313) reported considering changes in their social media presence due to the session. The analysis revealed themes relating to a broader understanding of online identity and opportunities to enhance careers. In a 6-month follow-up survey of 76 students in the 2014 cohort who completed the entire survey, 73 (94%) reported some increase in awareness, and 48 (64%) made changes to their social media behavior due to the session (response rate = 76/165; 46%), reflecting the longer term impact. Lessons Learned: Opportunities for discussion and reflection are essential for transformational learning to occur, enabling understanding of other perspectives. Incorporating student-submitted social media examples heightened student interest and engagement. The social media environment is continually changing, so curricular approaches should remain adaptable to ensure timeliness and relevance.

Despite attempts to define professionalism, it remains abstract for students and often not fully appreciated until they are in clinic. Without a way to make it personally relevant, students will likely be less motivated to learn. Intervention: We used student-generated word clouds to facilitate reflection and discussions, thereby helping students make their perceptions of professionalism more explicit. Group discussion was followed by a 5-minute written reflection. Word clouds created in Semesters 1 and 7 enabled students to compare perceptions at two points in the curriculum. Context: The George Washington University Doctor of Physical Therapy Program is a 3-year, 8-semester, 109-credit postgraduate program that includes 34 weeks of clinical practice. Reflection is foundational to the curriculum, and students reflect on their learning and professional growth each semester. Historically, students were introduced to professionalism in Semester 1 using explicit instructional strategies. Despite the wealth of resources, readings, and discussions, engagement remained challenging. Outcome: Student-generated word clouds created a personally relevant visual from which uniquely designed prompts were created to facilitate discussion. Having students compare word clouds across semesters enabled them to identify what, when, how, and where they learned about professionalism. Word clouds, categorized words, and 5-minute written reflections provided evidence of individual and collective changes in student perceptions. Lessons Learned: Students will engage in rich discussions on professionalism if it is personally relevant. Anonymity can foster discussion on personal characteristics and biases. Visualization of student-generated, narrative data enhanced reflection and discussion. Comparing word clouds from two points in time helped students articulate changes in their perceptions of professionalism. A 5-minute reflection can be a powerful learning tool for students and faculty. Outcomes demonstrated the value of designing interventions grounded in the educational principles. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013123681"

Literature regarding how to teach or apply systems thinking in practice is limited. This study aimed to understand how educators in medicine, physical therapy, physician assistant, nursing, and speech-language pathology education programs teach and assess systems thinking and SBP. Approach: Twenty-six educators from seven different degree programs across the five professions were interviewed and program descriptions and relevant course syllabi were reviewed. Qualitative analysis was iterative and incorporated inductive and deductive methods as well as a constant comparison of units of data to identify patterns and themes. Findings: Six themes were identified: 1) participants described systems thinking as ranging across four major levels of healthcare (i.e., patient, care team, organization, and external environment); 2) participants associated systems thinking with a wide range of activities across the curriculum including quality improvement, Inter-professional education (IPE), error mitigation, and advocacy; 3) the need for healthcare professionals to understand systems thinking was primarily externally driven; 4) participants perceived that learning systems thinking occurred mainly informally and experientially rather than through formal didactic instruction; 5) participants characterized systems thinking content as interspersed across the curriculum and described a variety of strategies for teaching and assessing it; 6) participants indicated a structured framework and inter-professional approach may enhance teaching and assessment of systems thinking. Insights: Systems thinking means different things to different health professionals. Teaching and assessing systems thinking across the health professions will require further training and practice. Tools, techniques, taxonomies and expertise outside of healthcare may be used to enhance the teaching, assessment, and application of systems thinking and SBP to clinical practice; however, these would need to be adapted and refined for use in healthcare. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85039556289"

Although teaching often is given lower priority and recognition as opposed to patient care and/or research, this activity for many physicians in academic medicine ranks second to their patient care responsibilities. Medical teacher training has traditionally been aimed at faculty and residents through faculty development initiatives, continuing education for physicians at professional conferences, formalized degree or certificate programs in education, and residents as teachers programs. More recently medical schools have developed medical-students-as-teachers programs, often offered as 4th-year electives, to introduce learners to the theory of teaching and learning with appropriate application in the clinical setting. Data on learner outcomes and students' perceptions and experiences in these programs consist mostly of their satisfaction after completing such a program. In this article we explore 4th-year medical student trainees' experiences and emerging self-concepts as educators during a teaching elective. Approach: The purpose of this project was to explore students' reflections on their experiences in a 4th-year medical students-as-teachers course in their own words through their written self-assessment narratives. We used qualitative content analysis to examine 96 trainees' self-reported, written reflective narratives of how they translated their students-as-teachers course experience into application by applying newly learned educational theories, instructional strategies, and feedback skills while teaching novice peers physical diagnosis skills. Findings: Narratives revealed candid self-assessments and detailed descriptions of their experiences and what they valued most from the course. Content analysis revealed nine key themes: using teaching strategies for adult learning, preparing for class, modeling professionalism, incorporating clinical correlations, exceeding course requirements, giving and receiving feedback, providing mentoring, creating a positive learning climate, and growing as educators. Insights: This study's results reveal how learners perceive and translate their experiences in a teaching course, in terms of incorporating particular knowledge or skills, valuing or displaying certain professional behaviors, and gaining self-awareness and satisfaction from teaching experiences. The findings of this study, specifically major themes from self-assessment narratives, provide us with a better understanding of medical students' developing identities and emerging professional self-concept as educators, specifically as experienced through a combination of formal teaching, and applying education theories and strategies. Findings may be informative from a program evaluation lens but also for faculty development initiatives related to training medical teachers and the larger landscape of the emerging field of Health Professions Education. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019173273"

The MMI stations were designed to assess 6 specific constructs (adaptability, empathy, integrity, critical thinking, teamwork [receiving instruction], teamwork [giving instruction]) and one open station about the candidate's interest in the school. Background: Despite the apparent benefits of the MMI, construct-irrelevant variance continues to be a topic of study. Refining the MMI to more effectively measure candidate ability is critical to improving our ability to identify and select candidates that are equipped for success within health professions education and the workforce. Approach: Each station assessed a single construct and was rated by a single interviewer who was provided only the name of the candidate and no additional information about the candidate's background, application, or prior academic performance. All interviewers received online and in-person training in the fall prior to the MMI and the morning of the MMI. A 3-facet multifaceted Rasch measurement analysis was completed to determine interviewer severity, candidate ability, and MMI station difficulty and examine how the model performed overall (e.g., rating scale). Results: Altogether, the Rasch measures explained 62.84% of the variance in the ratings. Differences in candidate ability explained 45.28% of the variance in the data, whereas differences in interviewer severity explained 16.09% of the variance in the data. None of the interviewers had Infit or Outfit mean-square scores greater than 1.7, and only 2 (5.4%) had mean-square scores less than 0.5. Conclusions: The data demonstrated acceptable fit to the multifaceted Rasch measurement model. This work is the first of its kind in pharmacy and provides insight into the development of an MMI that provides useful and meaningful candidate assessment ratings for institutional decision making. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84980006569"

Shame-provoking intimate examinations are among the most memorable events for students. Their emotions, however, are rarely addressed during training, potentially leading to withdrawal and avoidance and, consequently, performance deficits. However, emotions of negative valance such as shame may be particularly valuable for learning, as they might prompt mental rehearsal. We investigated the effect of shame on learning from the perspective of cognitive load theory. Hypotheses: We hypothesized that (a) training modality determines state shame, (b) state shame directly affects the quality of a clinical breast examination as one example of a shame-provoking exam, and (c) students who experience shame during training outperform those who just discuss the emotion during subsequent performance assessments. Method: Forty-nine advanced medical students participated in a randomized controlled, single-blinded study. After a basic, low-fidelity breast examination training, students were randomized to further practice either on a high-fidelity mannequin including a discussion of their emotions or by examining a standardized patient's real breasts. Last, all students conducted a breast examination in a simulated doctor's office. Dependent variables were measures of outcome and process quality and of situational shame. Results: Students training with a standardized patient experienced more shame during training (p <.001, d = 2.19), spent more time with the patient (p =.005, d = 0.89), and documented more breast lumps (p =.026, d = 0.65) than those training on a mannequin. Shame interacted with training modality, F(1, 45) = 21.484, p <.001, η2 = 0.323, and differences in performance positively correlated to decline in state shame (r =.335, p =.022). Conclusions: Students experiencing state shame during training do reenact their training and process germane load—in other words, learn. Furthermore, altering simulation modality offers a possibility for educators to adjust the affective component of training to their objectives. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008223188"

This can sometimes result in discordance between a physician's perception of a patient's health issue and a patient's perception of their health issue. Even after the physician has negotiated an understanding and treatment plan with a patient, subsequent interactions outside the physician–patient encounter may modify the patient's understanding of their health issue. A patient's reinterpretation of his or her health issue can then result in nonadherence of the treatment plan or even alternative treatment plans that the physician perceives as being unsatisfactory. Current models of physician–patient communication do not prepare physicians to manage this phenomenon. Approach: Using an ethnographic and a social network analysis research design, participants' patterns of social interaction around health information were investigated over a yearlong period (2012–2013) in a small rural community in Western Canada. Data included (a) individual interviews, (b) focus group interviews, and (c) field notes. Data were analyzed in a three-stage process: (a) item analysis, (b) pattern analysis, and (c) structural analysis. Findings: The findings highlight how physicians are only one nodal point in patients' broad, multilayered networks of communication. Interactions around health topics were not isolated events but rather occurred in various patterns of social interactions that were longitudinal and iterative. Meaning making around health topics was constructed, shared, elaborated, reconstructed, and interpreted in participants' social networks, as information was distributed through a complex temporal system of interpersonal ties. Insights: Issues concerning physician communication have been a long-standing conversation in the field of medical education. Many competency frameworks have attempted to encompass this core competency in their elaboration of the physician communicator. However, most representations and discussions in the field tend to depict physician communicators as experts who translate their knowledge to patients in a simplified way, in a single moment in time. This study suggests that educational initiatives in physician–patient communication would benefit from contextualizing physicians as part of patients' resource-rich, temporally extended, iterative process of meaning making. This alternative framing has the potential to support physicians' continuing engagement with patients as a meaningful and responsive node in patients' meaning-making networks. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038871404"

It is even more crucial in problem-based learning (PBL) tutorials, as the tutors, while directing students toward the identification and attainment of learning objectives, must stimulate them to contribute to the process and provide them with constructive feedback. PBL tutors in medicine lack opportunities to receive feedback from their peers on their teaching strategies. Moreover, as tutorials provide little or no time to stop and think, more could be learned by reflecting on the experience than from the experience itself. We designed and evaluated a faculty development approach to developing PBL tutors that combined self-reflection and peer feedback processes, both powerful techniques for improving performance in education. Intervention: We developed an observation instrument for PBL facilitation to be used both by tutors to self-observe and reflect on own teaching strategies and by peers to observe and provide feedback to tutors. Twenty PBL sessions were video-recorded. Tutors completed the instrument immediately after their PBL session and again while watching their video-recorded session (self-observation). A group of three observers completed the instrument while watching each recorded session and provided feedback to each tutor (peer observation and feedback). We investigated tutors' perceptions of the feasibility and acceptability of the approach and gathered data on its effectiveness in enhancing tutors' facilitation skills. Context: The preclinical medical curriculum at the University of Geneva is essentially taught by PBL. A new program of faculty development based on self-observation and peer feedback was offered to voluntary tutors and evaluated. Outcome: Our results suggest that self-observation and peer feedback, supported by an instrument, can be effective in enhancing tutors' facilitation skills. Reflection on self-observation raised teachers' awareness of the effectiveness of the strategies they used to foster student learning. This motivated a need to change their teaching practice. However, for the changes to become operative, peer feedback was required, providing the cues and strategies needed to improve the facilitation skills. Lessons Learned: Peer coaching was considered feasible and useful to improve tutors' facilitation skills. Evaluating the program made it possible to assess tutors' needs and the reasons underlying their difficulties, and this in turn provided the basis for advanced workshops. Nonetheless, aspects related to logistics and the time constraints of such an individualized approach, as well as the cultural appropriation of peer coaching, might be obstacles that need to be addressed. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014529833"

Effective feedback allows learners to acquire new skills, knowledge, and attitudes. Learners' perceptions of feedback are an important aspect to assess with valid methods in order to improve the feedback skills of educators and the feedback culture. Background: Although guidelines for delivering effective feedback have existed for several decades, medical students and residents often indicate that they receive little feedback. A recent scoping review on feedback in medical education did not reveal any validity evidence on instruments to assess learner's perceptions of feedback. The purpose of our study was to gather validity evidence on two novel FEEDME (Feedback in Medical Education) instruments to assess medical students' and residents' perceptions of the feedback that they receive. Approach: After the authors developed an initial instrument with 54 items, cognitive interviews with medical students and residents suggested that 2 separate instruments were needed, one focused on the feedback culture (FEEDME-Culture) and the other on the provider of feedback (FEEDME-Provider). A Delphi study with 17 medical education experts and faculty members assessed content validity. The response process was explored involving 31 medical students and residents at 2 academic institutions. Exploratory factor analysis and reliability analyses were performed on completed instruments. Results: Two Delphi consultation rounds refined the wording of items and eliminated several items. Learners found both instruments easy and quick to answer; it took them less than 5 minutes to complete. Learners preferred an electronic format of the instruments over paper. Factor analysis revealed a two- and three-factor solution for the FEEDME-Culture and FEEDME-Provider instruments, respectively. Cronbach's alpha was greater than 0.80 for all factors. Items on both instruments were moderately to highly correlated (range, r =.3–.7). Conclusions: Our results provide preliminary validity evidence of 2 novel feedback instruments. After further validation of both FEEDME instruments, sharing the results of the FEEDME-Culture instrument with educational leaders and faculty may improve the culture of feedback on specific educational rotations and at the institutional level. The FEEDME-Provider instrument could be useful for faculty development targeting feedback skills. Additional research studies could assess whether both instruments may be used to help learners receive feedback and prompt reflective learning. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038106471"

Fewer studies have examined PAL in the clinical context: These have focused mainly on the accuracy of peer assessment and potential benefits to learner communication and teamwork skills. Research has also examined the positive and negative effects of formal, structured PAL activities in the clinical setting. Given the prevalence of PAL activities during preclinical years, and the unstructured nature of clinical placements, it is likely that nonformal PAL activities are also undertaken. How PAL happens formally and informally and why students find PAL useful in this clinical setting remain poorly understood. Approach: This study aimed to describe PAL activities within the context of clinical placement learning and to explore students' perceptions of these activities. An ethnographic study was conducted to gather empirical data on engagement in clinical placement learning activities, including observations and interviews with students in their 1st clinical year, along with their supervising clinicians. Thematic analysis was used to interrogate the data. Findings: On average, students used PAL for 5.19 hours per week in a range of activities, of a total of 29.29 hours undertaking placements. PAL was recognized as a means of vicarious learning and had greater perceived value when an educator was present to guide or moderate the learning. Trust between students was seen as a requirement for PAL to be effective. Students found passive observation a barrier to PAL and were able to identify ways to adopt an active stance when observing peers interacting with patients. For example, learners reported that the expectation that they had to provide feedback to peers after task observation, resulted in them taking on a more critical gaze where they were encouraged to consider notions of good practice. Insights: Students use PAL in formal (i.e., tutorial) and nonformal (e.g., peer observation and feedback on the ward; discussion during lunch) situations in clinical education and find it useful. The educator is crucial in fostering PAL through providing opportunities for learners to practice together and in helping to moderate discussions about quality of performance. Student engagement in PAL may reduce passivity commonly reported in clinical rotations. Further directions for research into PAL in clinical education are identified along with potential strategies that may maximize the benefits of peer to peer learning. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84965082631"

However, PH competencies are numerous, and no consensus exists over which competencies are most important for adoption by current trainees. Our objective was to conduct a group concept mapping exercise with stakeholders identifying the most important and feasible PH skills to incorporate in medical and residency curricula. Approach: We utilized a group concept mapping technique via the Concept System Global Max (http://www.conceptsystems.com), where family medicine educators and PH professionals completed the phrase, “A key Public Health competency for physicians-in-training to learn is …” with 1–10 statements. The statement list was edited for duplication and other issues; stakeholders then sorted the statements and rated them for importance and feasibility of integration. Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were used to create a two-dimensional point map of domains of PH training, allowing visual comparison of groupings of related ideas and relative importance of these ideas. Findings: There were 116 nonduplicative statements (225 total) suggested by 120 participants. Three metacategories of competencies emerged: Clinic, Community & Culture, Health System Understanding, and Population Health Science & Data. Insights: We identified and organized a set of topics that serve as a foundation for the integration of family medicine and PH education. Incorporating these topics into medical education is viewed as important and feasible by family medicine educators and PH professions. © 2017 The Author(s).

An OSCE is a type of performance assessment in which a series of standardized patients interact with the student or candidate who is scored by either the standardized patient or a physician examiner. Background: In high-stakes examinations, test security is an important issue. Students accessing unauthorized test materials can create an unfair advantage and lead to examination scores that do not reflect students' true ability level. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of various simulated security breaches on OSCE scores. Approach: Seventy-six 3rd-year medical students participated in an 8-station OSCE and were randomized to either a control group or to 1 of 2 experimental conditions simulating test security breaches: station topic (i.e., providing a list of station topics prior to the examination) or egregious security breach (i.e., providing detailed content information prior to the examination). Overall total scores were compared for the 3 groups using both a one-way between-subjects analysis of variance and a repeated measure analysis of variance to compare the checklist, rating scales, and oral question subscores across the three conditions. Results: Overall total scores were highest for the egregious security breach condition (81.8%), followed by the station topic condition (73.6%), and they were lowest for the control group (67.4%). This trend was also found with checklist subscores only (79.1%, 64.9%, and 60.3%, respectively for the security breach, station topic, and control conditions). Rating scale subscores were higher for both the station topic and egregious security breach conditions compared to the control group (82.6%, 83.1%, and 77.6%, respectively). Oral question subscores were significantly higher for the egregious security breach condition (88.8%) followed by the station topic condition (64.3%), and they were the lowest for the control group (48.6%). Conclusions: This simulation of different OSCE security breaches demonstrated that student performance is greatly advantaged by having prior access to test materials. This has important implications for medical educators as they develop policies and procedures regarding the safeguarding and reuse of test content. © 2017 Medical Council of Canada.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84986213370"

Approach: We used a conditions-based learning theory to structure a review of the comparative-effectiveness literature on electrocardiogram instruction. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE (Ovid), ERIC (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), and CINAHL (EBSCO) from inception to June 2016. We selected prospective studies that examined the effect of instructional interventions on participants' knowledge and skill with electrocardiogram interpretation. Two reviewers extracted information on the quality of the studies, the effect of instruction on the acquisition of knowledge and skill, and instructional quality. Instructional quality is an index of the extent to which instruction incorporates 4 practices of Gagne's conditions-based learning theory: presenting information, eliciting performance, providing feedback, and assessing learning. Findings: Twenty-five studies (3,286 participants) evaluating 47 instructional interventions were synthesized. The methodological quality of most studies was moderate. Instructional quality varied: All interventions presented information and assessed learning, but fewer than half elicited performances or provided feedback. Instructional interventions that incorporated all 4 components improved trainees' abilities considerably more than those that incorporated 3 or fewer; respectively, standardized mean difference (SMD) = 2.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) [2.05, 3.55], versus SMD = 1.44, 95% CI [1.18, 1.69]. Studies that compared “innovative” to “traditional” types of instruction did not yield a significant pooled effect: SMD = 0.18, 95% CI [−0.09, 0.45]. Insights: The use of a conditions-based learning theory to organize the comparative-effectiveness literature reveals differences in the instructional impact of different instructional approaches.

Physician, nurse, or peer tutors are employed for training in those centers. All tutors should have appropriate training about the methodology used in the clinical skills training. Many of the studies revealed the effectiveness of various types of tutors. The aim of our study was to evaluate medical students' satisfaction with clinical skills training, and their opinions about the differences in coaching skills among the physician, nurse, and peer tutors. Approach: This study was conducted with third-year students (467 students) in 2013-2014 academic year at Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine. Participation rate was 85 % (397 students). The students attended the suturing skill training in groups of 40 students. First, a faculty member from the Department of Medical Education delivered a video demonstration and conducted discussion. After the demonstration, the students were divided into groups of 5-6 students. A physician, nurse, or a peer tutor facilitated each group. The students were asked to complete the Coaching Skills Evaluation Form after the practicum session. It contained 13 criteria for assessing the coaching skills. Additionally, the form included a question for rating the student's satisfaction with the tutor. The performance of the tutors at each step was rated on a three-point scale. Findings: Kruskal Wallis analysis was used to compare students' scores for their tutors. The students' satisfaction with tutors was high for all of the tutors. However, there was no difference between students' scores in suturing skill, and between physician, nurse, and peer tutors' coaching skills. Insights: In this study, we revealed that physician, nurse, and peer tutors were equally effective on the students' performances. They were also regarded as effective in their teaching role by students. But the most important point was that sufficient tutor training and preparation was crucial for the success of models. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015205634"

Quantitative analyses of survey responses and content analysis of free-text comments submitted by respondents were performed. Findings: A total of 456 physicians (50.6%) responded. Fewer than one fourth reported being exposed to teaching about high value care at least frequently (23.6%, 106/450). Only 43.8% of respondents (193/446) felt prepared to use overtreatment guidelines in conversations with patients, whereas 85.8% (379/447) felt prepared to participate in shared decision making with patients at the conclusion of their training, and 84.4% (380/450) reported practicing generic prescribing. Physicians who completed residency more recently were more likely to report practicing generic prescribing and feeling well prepared to use overtreatment guidelines in conversations with patients (p <.01 for both). Insights: In a national survey, recent U.S. internal medicine residency graduates were more likely to experience high value care during training, which may reflect increased national and local efforts in this area. However, being exposed to high value care as a trainee may not translate into specific tools for practice. In fact, many U.S. internists reported inadequate exposure to prepare them for patient discussions about costs and the use of overtreatment guidelines in practice. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026407400"

The impact is not fully understood, and few rigorous assessments of educational outcomes exist. This study assessed the impact of a point-of-care ultrasound curriculum on image acquisition, interpretation, and student and faculty perceptions of the course. Intervention: All 142 first-year medical students completed a curriculum on ultrasound physics and instrumentation, cardiac, thoracic, and abdominal imaging. A flipped classroom model of preclass tutorials and tests augmenting live, hands-on scanning sessions was incorporated into the physical examination course. Students and faculty completed surveys on impressions of the curriculum, and all students under-went competency assessments with standardized patients. Context: The curriculum was a mandatory part of the physical examination course and was taught by experienced clinician-sonographers as well as faculty who do not routinely perform sonography in their clinical practice. Outcome: Students and faculty agreed that the physical examination course was the right time to introduce ultrasound (87% and 80%). Students demonstrated proper use of the ultrasound machine functions (M score = 91.55), and cardiac, thoracic, and abdominal system assessments (M score = 80.35, 79.58, and 71.57, respectively). Students and faculty valued the curriculum, and students demonstrated basic competency in performance and interpretation of ultrasound. Further study is needed to determine how to best incorporate this emerging technology into a robust learning experience for medical students. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84969287150"

Furthermore, most training programs to address these requirements are broad in nature and do not focus on addressing health disparities. The lack of integration may reduce the students' ability to apply the knowledge learned. Innovative programs that combine these two learning objectives and focus on disenfranchised communities are needed to train the next generation of health professionals. Intervention: A unique interprofessional education program was developed at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Northwest. The program includes experiential learning, cultural exposure, and competence-building activities for interprofessional teams of medicine, nursing, and pharmacy students. The activities include (a) educational seminars, (b) clinical experiential learning in a student-led clinic, and (c) community-based service-learning through health assessments and survey research events. Context: The program focuses on interprofessional collaboration to address the health disparities experienced by the Marshallese community in northwest Arkansas. The Marshallese are Pacific Islanders who suffer from significant health disparities related to chronic and infectious diseases. Outcome: Comparison tests revealed statistically significant changes in participants' retrospectively reported pre/posttest scores for Subscales 1 and 2 of the Readiness for Interpersonal Learning Scale and for the Caffrey Cultural Competence in Healthcare Scale. However, no significant change was found for Subscale 3 of the Readiness for Interpersonal Learning Scale. Qualitative findings demonstrated a change in students' knowledge, attitudes, and behavior toward working with other professions and the underserved population. Lessons Learned: The program had to be flexible enough to meet the educational requirements and class schedules of the different health professions' education programs. The target community spoke limited English, so providing interpretation services using bilingual Marshallese community health workers was integral to the program's success. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85035773879"

We sought to describe how culture, bias, and socialization shape gendered thinking regarding specialty choice at a Canadian undergraduate medical institution. Approach: We analyzed transcripts from the Career Choices Project: 16 semistructured focus group discussions with 70 students graduating from Memorial University of Newfoundland in 2003, 2006, 2007, and 2008. The questions and prompts were designed to explore factors influencing specialty choice and did not specifically probe gender-based experiences. Focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed, and deidentified before analysis. Analysis was inductive and guided by principles of orientational qualitative inquiry using a gender-specific lens. Findings: The pursuits of personal and professional goals, as well as contextual factors, were the major themes that influenced decision-making for women and men. Composition of these major themes varied between genders. Influence of a partner, consideration of familial commitments (both present and future), feeling a sense of connectedness with the field in question, and social accountability were described by women as important. Both genders hoped to pursue careers that would afford “flexibility” in order to balance work with their personal lives, though the construct of work–life balance differed between genders. Women did not explicitly identify gender bias or sexism as influencing factors, but their narratives suggest that these elements were at play. Insights: Our findings suggest that unlike men, women's decision-making is informed by tension between personal and professional goals, likely related to the context of gendered personal and societal expectations. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019253729"

Intervention: Using implementation science as a guide, we adapted a community development model to sequentially implement an evidence-based intervention, Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) for alcohol and drug use problems, across internal medicine, pediatrics, emergency medicine, psychiatry, and obstetrics and gynecology residency programs. Context: A grant-funded “executive” team coordinated the implementation, enrolled a new residency program annually, and served as the consultative team to span the programs. The team was attentive to aligning implementation with the needs of each program. To assist in planning, the team included a program champion 1 year prior to SBIRT implementation to provide the opportunity to develop resources and work with peers. We evaluated this model through an implementation science lens using a case study approach that included interviews and quantitative tabulation of products and resident perceptions. Outcome: We successfully instituted SBIRT training in all 5 residency programs through the use of a supported local champion model. Teams developed 90 curricular products and had 57 presentations and publications. Residents reported satisfaction with the SBIRT activities. Champions reported that SBIRT was a useful approach and that they gained valuable knowledge and relationships from working with the executive team when designing learning materials appropriate for their residency. Champions successfully incorporated SBIRT into routine clinical practice. Lessons Learned: Having a strong team to support subsequent SBIRT champions was essential for implementation. The champions needed financial support to have the necessary time to implement training. The strategy of building a peer network across programs was critical for sustaining the implementation. Collecting and sharing resources aided the champions in developing their materials. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019243230"

Nonphysician members on interprofessional (IP) teams have valuable perspectives on actual resident performance and are often not adequately engaged in the provision of feedback to residents. Based on the educational theories of collaborative evaluation and social constructivism, this research examined the ability of IP clinicians to provide feedback to residents. The aim of this study was to examine IP clinicians' perceptions of their ability to provide formative feedback, through their observations and assessments of developmental pediatric residents, compared to physician supervisors on the rotation, and to qualitatively explore potential barriers to the feedback process from their perspective. Approach: This explanatory, sequential mixed-methods design study first examined which and how many of the CanMEDS Communicator and Collaborator training objectives (N = 40) were considered to be observable and assessable by IP clinicians and physicians. A comparison of the mean number of objectives that were observed and practically assessed by (a) each group (IP clinicians vs. physicians) and (b) clinical service teams during the core developmental pediatrics rotations, were examined using independent t tests. Second, a thematic qualitative analysis of focus groups was used to develop a contextual understanding of the factors that influenced this process. Data were analyzed using three levels of open coding and descriptive qualitative analysis techniques. Findings: Physicians reported they could observe (M = 33.3, SD = 5.2, 83.3%) and assess (M = 31.5, SD = 7.3, 79%) a larger number of objectives compared to the IP clinician group (M = 24.7, SD = 8.6, 61.8% and M = 20.3, SD = 10.6, 51%, respectively). There were no differences between the clinical service teams (i.e., preschool/school-age and pediatric rehabilitation). The objective that was most observable and assessable by the IP clinicians was “Demonstrates a respectful attitude towards other colleagues and members of an interprofessional team.” Four themes identified by the IP clinicians provided more in-depth qualitative information: (a) assessment requires more than simple observation, (b) assumptions and indirect observation influence assessment, (c) clinic culture and structure shapes observation and assessment, and (d) specific assessment criteria are required by IP clinicians. Insights: IP clinicians have the desire and ability to provide formative feedback to residents. Formalized processes with specific evaluation criteria would facilitate meaningful feedback from IP clinicians in the assessment of residents as they journey toward competence. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019247159"

Few validated approaches exist to teach these skills. Our objective was to develop, implement, and evaluate an ambulatory practice improvement curriculum capitalizing on peer feedback aimed at improving cardiology fellow guideline knowledge, adherence, and chart documentation. Intervention: Four outpatient topics were reviewed in dedicated 1-hour sessions: stable ischemic heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and aortic valvular disease. Each session began with peer review, critique, and guideline adherence discussion of deidentified outpatient fellow clinic charts, followed by discussion of clinical guidelines. The open discussion of real clinic notes provided a forum for peer feedback exchange. Before each session and after the final session, participants completed a multiple-choice knowledge assessment and self-assessment of comfort with the guidelines. To evaluate the potential effect on patient care, random clinic chart audits were conducted before and after the curriculum using a chart scoring system. Context: Although the format is broadly applicable, the specific curriculum content was designed for a cardiology fellowship cohort in a large academic medical center. It was organized and implemented by 2 cardiology fellows under the direction and supervision of program directors. The curriculum was implemented during prescheduled noon conference hours. The intention was to carry forward this ambulatory curriculum in subsequent years and to use the first 4 sessions to study its potential successes and opportunities for improvement. Outcome: All 22 general cardiology fellows attended at least two sessions (M = 3.1). Knowledge test scores rose from 52.6% to 73.0% (20.4% increase, p <.001), 95% confidence interval (CI) [13.6%, 27.2%]. Self-reported guidelines knowledge improved by 15.1% (p =.002), 95% CI [6.2%, 24.0%], and self-reported documentation improved by 12.5% (p =.008), 95% CI [3.8%, 21.7%]. Chart audit scores improved by 17.8% (p <.001), 95% CI [10.6%, 25.0%], driven in part by 16.4% improvement in adherence to Class I therapies (p =.001). Lessons Learned: A targeted curriculum combining peer chart review, feedback, and guideline discussion was associated with significant improvement in fellows' knowledge and adherence to evidence-based therapies. Peer assessment and group-based education and feedback can be leveraged to improve trainee education and impact patient care. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040990924"

A 50/50 block schedule, which alternates inpatient and outpatient rotations and concentrates continuity clinic during outpatient rotations, minimizes conflicting responsibilities. However, its impact on patient care has not been widely studied. Continuity is a concern, and intervisit continuity in particular has not been evaluated. Intervention: We implemented a 50/50 block model with “clinic buddy” system to optimize continuity and assessed outcomes pre- and postintervention. Residents alternated inpatient and elective blocks, with clinic 1 full day per week on elective blocks only. Resident and preceptor perceptions were measured using 5-point Likert surveys to evaluate impact on clinic experience and workload. The authors calculated visit and intervisit continuity using a Usual Provider of Care index and measured blood pressure and hemoglobin A1c as quality markers to evaluate the impact on continuity and quality of care. Context: Participants were 208 medicine residents and 39 core faculty members at 3 University of Pittsburgh Medical Center clinics. The intervention was implemented in June 2014. Outcome: In the 50/50 system, inpatient distractions decreased (3.59 vs. 1.71, p <.001). Residents more strongly agreed that there was adequate time for conferences (3.33 vs. 4.05), they worked well within the system to achieve best patient care (3.13 vs. 3.61), and multidisciplinary teams worked well together (3.51 vs. 4.08) (all p <.001). Intervisit continuity was unchanged (73%, both models, p =.79). Visit continuity decreased (67.2% vs. 63.7%, p <.001). Blood pressure and hemoglobin A1c were unchanged. Lessons Learned: This 50/50 model minimized inpatient distractions in clinic and increased perceived time for learning.

At the same time, a growing interest in self-compassion has emerged, which is seen as facilitating compassion toward others. Little research has explored, in depth, what compassion to self and others means to medical students. Therefore, a study was designed to address this gap in knowledge. Approach: A qualitative study was conducted, involving students from all 4 years of a graduate-entry medical school in the United Kingdom. Focus groups were used to obtain the views of students on compassion for self and others (patients). Care was taken to achieve variation within the sample in terms of age, gender, and year of study. Focus groups were completed between September and October 2016. An inductive thematic analysis was performed. Findings: A total of 31 students participated in 4 focus groups, each lasting between 60 and 90 minutes. Having the cognitive freedom—“headspace”—to be aware of and respond to one's own and others’ difficulties and distress was identified as an overarching theme within the data. This was underpinned by the themes developed during analysis: (a) bringing humanity into the workplace; (b) compassion as a variable, innate resource; (c) zoning into an individual's current needs; and (d) collective compassion. Students talked about the importance of being adaptable and responsive to situational factors in relation to self-compassion and compassionate care. They also highlighted the contribution of role models in promoting compassion to self and others. Insights: It is important for medical educators to explore ways of enhancing students’ compassion to self and others during their training and beyond. Integrating approaches to “well-being” into the curriculum can create opportunities for self-compassion development, but rigid protocols could derail these efforts. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041291877"

A nonmedical home visit performed at the beginning of residency training may help residents better understand social underpinnings related to their patient's health and place subsequent care within the context of the patient's life. Intervention: First-year internal medicine residents completed a nonmedical home visit to an at-risk patient prior to seeing the patient in the office for his or her first medical visit. Context: We performed a thematic analysis of internal medicine interns' (n = 16) written narratives on their experience of getting to know a complex patient in his or her home prior to seeing the patient for a medical visit. Narratives were written by the residents immediately following the visit and then again at the end of the intern year, to assess for lasting impact of the intervention. Residents were from an urban academic residency program in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Outcome: We identified four themes from the submitted narratives. Residents discussed the visit's impact on future practice, the effect of the community and support system on health, the impact on the depth of the relationship, and the visit as a source of professional fulfillment. Whereas the four themes were present at both time points, the narratives completed immediately following the visit focused more on the themes of impact of future practice and the effect of the community and support system on health. The influence of the home visit on the depth of the relationship was a more prevalent theme in the end-of-the-year narratives. Lessons Learned: Although there is evidence to support the utility of learners completing medical home visits, this exploratory study shows that a nonmedical home visit can be rewarding and formative for early resident physicians. Future studies could examine the patient's perspective on the experience and whether a nonmedical home visit is a valuable tool in other patient populations. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041623114"

This model proposes that the moral intuition to care/harm motivates students to extend care to those in need. Hypotheses: Hypothesis 1: Medical students will report stronger preferences for the intuition to Care/harm over other moral intuitions in clinical decision making. Hypothesis 2: Care/harm will have the strongest correlation with Generosity than the other moral intuitions. Hypothesis 3: There will be positive associations between Care/harm and the caring virtues (Mindfulness, Empathic Compassion, and Generosity). Hypotheses 4–5: The virtue of Empathic Compassion (or Mindfulness) will moderate the relationship between Care/harm and Generosity. Hypotheses 6–7: Neuroticism (or Burnout) will negatively moderate the association between Care/harm and Generosity (or between Empathic Compassion and Generosity). Method: The authors used data from a 2011 nationally representative sample of U.S. medical students (N = 500) to test the relationship between the moral intuition to Care/harm and physician caring virtues. Moral intuitions were assessed using the Moral Foundations Questionnaire, whereas physician virtues were measured using scales adapted from validated constructs. Results: The authors found that students reported stronger preferences for the intuition to Care/harm over the four other moral intuitions. Each moral foundation was weakly but significantly correlated with Generosity, yet Care/harm had the strongest correlation among them. Neuroticism and Burnout did not weaken the link between Care/harm and the virtues. Conclusions: Data from the descriptive-correlational study reported here offer preliminary support for the construct validity of an educational model that targets the moral intuitions. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of a moral intuitionist approach for medical character education and offers three hypotheses for future empirical research. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84980002143"

Much has been written about the benefits of these experiences for the student, and concerns have been raised regarding the burden of IMEs on host communities. The voices of physicians from low- and middle-income countries who supervise IMEs have not been explored in depth. The current study sought to investigate host–physician perspectives on IMEs. Approach: Host supervisors were recruited by convenience sampling through students travelling abroad for IMEs during the summer of 2012. From 2012 through 2014, 11 semistructured interviews were conducted by telephone with host supervisors from Nepal, Uganda, Ghana, Guyana, and Kenya. Participants were invited to describe their motivations for hosting IMEs and their experiences of the benefits and harms of IMEs. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and checked for accuracy. An initial coding framework was developed and underwent multiple revisions, after which analytic categories were derived using conventional qualitative content analysis. Findings: For host supervisors, visits from international medical students provided a window into the resource-rich medical practice of high-income countries, and supervisors positioned themselves, their education, and clinical expertise against perceived standards of the international students' context. Hosting IMEs also contributed to supervisors' identities as educators connected to a global community. Supervisors described the challenge of helping students navigate their distress when confronting global health inequity. Finally, the desire for increasingly reciprocal relationships was expressed as a hope for the future. Insights: IMEs can be formative for host supervisors' identities and are used to benchmark host institutions compared with international medical standards. Reciprocity was articulated as essential for IMEs moving forward. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044268176"

This qualitative article explores the question of whether systematic reviews can support “evidence informed” teaching and contrasts traditional systematic reviewing with a knowledge translation (KT) approach to this objective. Approach: Degrees of freedom analysis (DOFA) is used to examine the alignment of systematic review methods with educational research and the pedagogical strategies and approaches that might be considered with a decision-making framework developed to support valid assessment. This method is also used to explore how KT can be used to inform teaching and learning. Findings: The nature of educational research is not compatible with most (11/14) methods for systematic review. The inconsistency of systematic reviewing with the nature of educational research impedes both the identification and implementation of “best-evidence” pedagogy and teaching. This is primarily because research questions that do support the purposes of review do not support educational decision making. By contrast to systematic reviews of the literature, both a DOFA and KT are fully compatible with informing teaching using evidence. A DOFA supports the translation of theory to a specific teaching or learning case, so could be considered a type of KT. The DOFA results in a test of alignment of decision options with relevant educational theory, and KT leads to interventions in teaching or learning that can be evaluated. Examples of how to structure evaluable interventions are derived from a KT approach that are simply not available from a systematic review. Insights: Systematic reviewing of current empirical educational research is not suitable for deriving or supporting best practices in education. However, both “evidence-informed” and scholarly approaches to teaching can be supported as KT projects, which are inherently evaluable and can generate actionable evidence about whether the decision or intervention worked for students, instructors, and the institution. A DOFA can also support evidence- and theory-informed teaching to develop an understanding of what works, why, and for whom. Thus KT, but not systematic reviewing, can support decision making around pedagogy (and pedagogical innovation) that can also inform new teaching and learning initiatives; it can also point to new avenues of empirical research in education that are informed by, and can inform, theory. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016520733"

Most professionalism assessments in medical training are delayed until clinical rotations where multisource feedback is available. This leaves a gap in student assessment portfolios and potentially delays professional development. Approach: A total of 246 second-year medical students (2013–2015) completed self- and peer assessments of professional behaviors in 2 courses following a series of Team-Based Learning exercises. Correlation and regression analyses were used to examine the alignment or misalignment in the relationship between the 2 types of assessments. Four subgroups were formed based on observed patterns of initial self- and peer assessment alignment or misalignment, and subgroup membership stability over time was assessed. A missing data analysis examined differences between average peer assessment scores as a function of selective nonparticipation. Findings: Spearman correlation demonstrated moderate to strong correlation between self-assessments completed alone (no simultaneous peer assessment) and self-assessments completed at the time of peer assessments (ρ =.59, p <.0001) but weak correlation between the two self-assessments and peer assessments (alone: ρ =.13, p <.013; at time of peer: ρ =.21, p <.0001). Generalized estimating equation models revealed that self-assessments done alone (p <.0001) were a significant predictor of self-assessments done at the time of peer. Course was also a significant predictor (p =.01) of self-assessment scores done at the time of peer. Peer assessment score was not a significant predictor. Bhapkar's test revealed subgroup membership based on the relationship between self- and peer ratings was relatively stable across Time 1 and Time 2 assessments (χ2 = 0.83, p =.84) for all but one subgroup; members of the subgroup with initially high self-assessment and low peer assessment were significantly more likely to move to a new classification at the second measurement. A missing data analysis revealed that students who completed all self-assessments had significantly higher average peer assessment ratings compared to students who completed one or no self-assessments with a difference of –0.32, 95% confidence interval [–0.48, –0.15]. Insights: Multiple measurements of simultaneous self- and peer assessment identified a subgroup of students who consistently rated themselves higher on professionalism attributes relative to the low ratings given by their peers. This subgroup of preclinical students, along with those who elected to not complete self-assessments, may be at risk for professionalism concerns. Use of this multisource feedback tool to measure perceptual stability of professionalism behaviors is a new approach that may assist with early identification of at-risk students during preclinical years. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019210060"

Script concordance testing (SCT) evaluates clinical reasoning in conditions of uncertainty and has emerged as an innovative tool in the domain of clinical reasoning assessment. SCT quantifies the degree of concordance between a learner and an experienced clinician and attempts to capture the breadth of responses of expert clinicians, acknowledging the significant yet acceptable variation in practice under situations of uncertainty. Background: SCT has been shown to be a valid and reliable clinical reasoning assessment tool. However, as SCT provides only quantitative information, it may not provide a complete assessment of clinical reasoning. Approach: Think aloud (TA) is a qualitative research tool used in clinical reasoning assessment in which learners verbalize their thought process around an assigned task. This study explores the use of TA, in the form of written reflection, in SCT to assess resident clinical reasoning, hypothesizing that the information obtained from the written TA would enrich the quantitative data obtained through SCT. Ninety-one pediatric postgraduate trainees and 21 pediatricians from 4 Canadian training centers completed an online test consisting of 24 SCT cases immediately followed by retrospective written TA. Six of 24 cases were selected to gather TA data. These cases were chosen to allow all phases of clinical decision making (diagnosis, investigation, and treatment) to be represented in the TA data. Inductive thematic analysis was employed when systematically reviewing TA responses. Results: Three main benefits of adding written TA to SCT were identified: (a) uncovering instances of incorrect clinical reasoning despite a correct SCT response, (b) revealing sound clinical reasoning in the context of a suboptimal SCT response, and (c) detecting question misinterpretation. Conclusions: Written TA can optimize SCT by demonstrating when correct examinee responses are based on guessing or uncertainty rather than robust clinical rationale. TA can also enhance SCT by allowing examinees to provide justification for responses that otherwise would have been considered incorrect and by identifying questions that are frequently misinterpreted to avoid including them in future examinations. TA also has significant value in differentiating between acceptable variations in expert clinician responses and deviance associated with faulty rationale or question misinterpretation; this could improve SCT reliability. A written TA protocol appears to be a valuable tool to assess trainees' clinical reasoning and can strengthen the quantitative assessment provided by SCT. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84988553143"

Medical education includes numerous subjects frequently identified as triggers, such as abuse, rape, self-injurious behaviors, eating disorders, drug and alcohol addiction, and suicide. Thus, exploring medical students' perceptions of trigger warnings may provide a valuable perspective on the use of these warnings in higher education. Approach: As part of a larger descriptive, cross-sectional survey study on medical education, we assessed 1st- and 2nd-year medical students' perceptions of trigger warnings in the preclinical curriculum. Five questions specific to trigger warnings explored students' knowledge, prior experience, and perceptions of trigger warnings in medical education. Frequencies of individual question responses were calculated, and qualitative data were analyzed via content and thematic analyses. Findings: Of the 424 medical students invited to participate, 259 completed the survey (M = 24.8 years, SD + 3.4, 51.4% female, 76.1% White, 53.7% 1st-year students). Few students (11.2%) were aware of the term trigger warning and its definition. However, after being presented with a formal definition on the online survey, 38.6% reported having had a professor use one. When asked whether they supported the use of trigger warnings in medical education, respondents were distributed fairly equally by response (yes = 31.0%, maybe = 39.2%, no = 29.7%). Qualitative analysis revealed three themes: (a) Trigger Warnings Allow Students to Know What is Coming and Prepare Themselves: Respondents believed that trigger warnings would benefit students with a history of trauma by providing them additional time to prepare for the material and, if appropriate, seek professional help; (b) Students Need to Learn How to Handle Distressing Information: Respondents agreed that they needed to learn and cope with highly sensitive material because they would be confronted with difficult and unexpected situations in clinical practice; and (c) Trigger Warnings Help Students Understand the Severity of the Material: Respondents felt that trigger warnings may help students understand the severity of the material being covered and increase awareness about trauma and its effects on health and well-being. Insights: Findings did not reach consensus for or against the use of trigger warnings in medical school; however, students emphasized the importance of learning how to cope with distressing material. Trigger warnings may represent a teaching tool to facilitate classroom discussions about the severity of trauma-related material and problem-focused coping strategies. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026399309"

Previous research has explored other elements of the medical education continuum. However, little is known regarding minorities' perceptions of navigating the medical school admissions process. To address this gap in the literature, this exploratory study suggests a conceptual model describing why minorities apply to medical school and the influences affecting their admissions experience. Approach: This qualitative study utilized a grounded theory approach. Between December 2012 and January 2014, the principal researcher conducted one-on-one telephone and in-person small-group interviews, as well as web-based telephone feedback sessions, with Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino medical students. Findings: Thirty-three students participated, including 23 Black/African American and 10 Hispanic/Latino medical students. Participants represented 25 U.S. allopathic medical schools. Emergent themes are categorized under 2 headings: (a) motivations for a career in medicine and (b) barriers and supports. Motivations for a career in medicine include perceived fit, prior experience or knowledge, encouragement and role models, desire to help others, interest in science, and perceived benefits. Barriers and supports included information, guidance and social support, financial and academic factors, and persistence. Insights: Building on theories of student college choice and academic capital formation, the researcher's analysis and interpretations result in the proposal of a conceptual model describing minority applicants' experience in medical school admissions. The study also suggests research and practice implications related to premedical advising, mentoring, financial assistance, information, outreach, and data collection. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994681075"

Background: OSCE progress tests typically employ similar rating instruments as traditional OSCEs. However, progress tests differ from other assessment modalities because learners from different stages of training participate in the same examination, which can pose challenges when deciding how to assign scores. In an attempt to better capture performance, nonbinary checklists were introduced in two OSCE progress tests. The purposes of this study were (a) to identify differences in the use of checklist options (e.g., done satisfactorily, attempted, or not done) by task type, (b) to analyze the impact of different scoring methods using nonbinary checklists for two OSCE progress tests (nonprocedural and procedural) for Internal Medicine residents, and (c) to determine which scoring method is better suited for a given task. Approach: A retrospective analysis examined differences in scores (n = 119) for two OSCE progress tests (procedural and nonprocedural). Scoring methods (hawk, dove, and hybrid) varied in stringency in how they awarded marks for nonbinary checklist items that were rated as done satisfactorily, attempted, or not done. Difficulty, reliability (internal consistency), item-total correlations and pass rates were compared for each OSCE using the three scoring methods. Results: Mean OSCE scores were highest using the dove method and lowest using the hawk method. The hawk method resulted in higher item-total correlations for most stations, but there were differences by task type. Overall score reliability calculated using the three methods did not differ significantly. Pass–fail status differed as a function of scoring methods and exam type, with the hawk and hybrid methods resulting in higher failure rates for the nonprocedural OSCE and the dove method resulting in a higher failure rate for the procedural OSCE. Conclusion: The use of different scoring methods for nonbinary OSCE checklists resulted in differences in mean scores and pass–fail status. The results varied with procedural and nonprocedural OSCEs. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84990203169"

Coteaching relationships are not always effective, which has the potential to affect the student experience. The purpose of this study was to explore interdisciplinary coteaching relationships between a physician (MD) and social behavioral scientist (SBS) in an undergraduate clinical skills course. We aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of what teachers perceive as influencing the quality of relationships to begin to construct a framework for collaborative teaching in medical education. Approach: A qualitative study was conducted consisting of 12 semistructured interviews (6 MD and 6 SBS) and 2 monodisciplinary focus groups. Sampling was purposive and aimed at maximal variation from among 64 possible faculty. The data were analyzed using the constant comparative method to develop a grounded theory. Findings: Five major themes resulted from the analysis that outline a framework for interdisciplinary coteaching: respect, shared goals, shared knowledge and understanding, communication, and complementary pairings. Insights: The first 4 themes align with elements of relational coordination theory, an organizational theory of collaborative practice that describes how work roles interact. The complementary pairings extend this theory from work roles to individuals, with unique identities and personal beliefs and values about teaching. Prior studies on coteaching have not provided a clear linkage to theory. The conceptual framework helps suggest future directions for coteaching research and has practical implications for administrative practices and faculty development. These findings contribute to the sparse research in medical education on interdisciplinary coteaching relationships. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85035815533"

The authors explored differences in students' use of active, problem-solving strategies and emotional, inwardly directed approaches; the change in coping strategies used during medical school; and coping strategy impact on performance. Approach: One hundred eighty-three students completed the Ways of Coping Scale at matriculation and end of the 2nd and 3rd years. Frequency of each of 8 ways of coping, changes in coping strategy use over time, and relationship of coping method with preclinical and clinical scores were calculated. Findings: Students varied widely in use of coping mechanisms. Over time, students shifted to using emotional strategies more frequently while decreasing their use of active strategies. Coping strategies were unrelated to preclinical academic performance (R2 =.09, adjusted R2 =.04, ns) but were related to clinical performance (R2 =.23, adjusted R2 =.18, p <.0001), with active coping associated with higher performance and emotional methods associated with lower performance. Insights: Students decreased use of active coping strategies and increased use of emotional coping strategies over time, but emotional strategies were associated with poorer clinical academic performance. These shifts in coping methods may be detrimental to student performance and learning. Improving students' ability to cope should be an educational priority. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026405206"

One possible source is the routinized use of race/ethnicity in lectures, assessment, and preparatory materials, including question banks for licensing examinations. Because students worldwide use question banks to prepare for the United States Medical Licensing Examination, we examined how race/ethnicity was used in one of the most commonly recommended question banks. Approach: We analyzed the use of race/ethnicity in all 2,211 questions in a question bank for Step 1 of the United States Medical Licensing Examination for the following: the frequency of mentions of racial/ethnic groups, whether the use of race/ethnicity was merely descriptive or was central to any part of the question, and whether the question associated race/ethnicity with genetic difference. Findings. In sum, 455 of the 2,011 (20.6%) of the questions in the question bank referred to race/ethnicity in the question stem, answer, or educational objective. The frequency of mentions of racial/ethnicity was disproportionate to the U.S. population: 85.8% referred to White/Caucasians, 9.70% to Black/African Americans, 3.16% to Asian, 0.633% to Hispanics, and 0.633% to Native Americans. No cases referred to Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders. The proportion of mentions of race/ethnicity classified as either a routine descriptor or central to the case varied by racial/ethnic category. The association between genetics and disease in cases also varied by racial/ethnic category. Insights. The routinized use of race/ethnicity with no specific goal in preparation materials, such as question banks, risks contributing to racial bias. The implications of routinized use extend to assessment in medical education. Race/ethnicity should be used only when referring to social experiences of groups relevant to their health, not as a proxy for genetics, social class, or culture. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008233964"

Background: Medical education research requires the use of several different instruments with dozens of items that evaluate each construct separately, making their application slow and increasing the likelihood of students providing a large number of incomplete or missing responses. To provide an alternative measure, this study aims to translate, adapt, and validate the multidimensional ESWIM instrument for Brazilian medical students. This is a very promising instrument because it is multidimensional, relatively short, and cost free; it evaluates important constructs; and it has been explicitly designed for use in the medical context. Approach: The English-language instrument was translated and adapted into the Brazilian Portuguese language using standard procedures: translation, transcultural adaptation, and back-translation. ESWIM was administered to students in all years of the medical curriculum. A retest was given 45 days later to evaluate reliability. To assess validity, the questionnaire also included sociodemographic data, the Duke Religion Index, the Empathy Inventory, the brief version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-Bref), and the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory. Results: A total of 776 medical students (M age = 22.34 years, SD = 3.11) were assessed. The Brazilian Portuguese version of ESWIM showed good internal consistency for the factor of Empathy (α = 0.79-0.81) and borderline internal consistency for the other factors: Openness to Spirituality (α = 0.61–0.66), Wellness (α = 0.57–0.68), and Tolerance (α = 0.56–0.65). The principal component analysis revealed a four-factor structure; however, the confirmatory factor analysis showed a better fit for a three-factor structure. We found a significant positive correlation between ESWIM empathy and empathy measured by the Empathy Inventory (r =.444, p <.01), as well as negative correlations between ESWIM empathy and burnout (r = −.145 to −.224, p <.01). ESWIM openness to spirituality was also significantly correlated with different subscales of religiosity (r =.301–.417, p <.01), and ESWIM wellness was significantly correlated with the WHOQOL-Bref factors (r =.390–.673, p <.01). The test–retest reliability (applied to 83 students) was high for all factors except Tolerance. Conclusion: This study provides supportive evidence regarding the reliability and validity of ESWIM empathy scores. The ESWIM scale opens a new field of research in relation to openness to spirituality by introducing a scale that measures this openness attitude. Despite borderline internal consistency, ESWIM wellness was strongly associated with quality of life and had good test–retest reliability. Thus, ESWIM appears to be a valid option for evaluating these constructs in medical students. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045128873"

As one of the most common chronic disease affecting adults and children, obesity is a major contributor to noncommunicable diseases, both nationally and globally. Obesity adversely affects every organ system, and as such it is imperative that the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) adequately assesses students' knowledge about the science and practice of obesity management. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the coverage and distribution of obesity-related items on the three USMLE Step examinations. Approach. Examination items that included obesity-related keywords were identified by National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) staff. A panel of 6 content experts evaluated all items and coded obesity-relevant items using the American Board of Obesity Medicine (ABOM) test outline rubric into 4 domains and 107 subdomains. Findings. There were 802 multiple-choice items containing obesity-related keywords identified by NBME, of which 289 (36%) were identified as being relevant to obesity and were coded into appropriate domains and subdomains. Among the individual domains, the Diagnosis & Evaluation domain comprised most of the items (174) for all 3 Step examinations. Fifty-eight percent of items were represented by 4 of 17 organ systems, and 80% of coded items were represented by 6 ABOM subdomains. The majority of obesity-coded items pertained to the diagnosis and management of obesity-related comorbid conditions rather than addressing the prevention, diagnosis, or management of obesity itself. Insights. The most important concepts of obesity prevention and treatment were not represented on the Step exams. Exam items primarily addressed the diagnosis and treatment of obesity-related comorbid conditions instead of obesity itself. The expert review panel identified numerous important obesity-related topics that were insufficiently addressed or entirely absent from the examinations. The reviewers recommend that the areas identified for improvement may promote a more balanced testing of knowledge in obesity. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007470590"

We explored high-stakes collaborative testing in medical education, looking specifically at the experiences of students in established and newly formed teams. Approach: Third-year psychiatry students at 5 medical schools across 6 sites participated, with 4 participating as established team sites and 2 as comparison team sites. For the collaborative test, we used the National Board of Medical Examiners Psychiatry subject test, administering it via a 2-stage process. Students at all sites were randomly selected to participate in a focus group, with 8–10 students per site (N = 49). We also examined quantitative data for additional triangulation. Findings: Students described a range of heightened emotions around the collaborative test yet perceived it as valuable regardless if they were in established or newly formed teams. Students described learning about the subject matter, themselves, others, and interpersonal dynamics during collaborative testing. Triangulation of these results via quantitative data supported these themes. Insights: Despite student concerns, high-stakes collaborative tests may be both valuable and feasible. The data suggest that high-stakes tests (tests of learning or summative evaluation) could also become tests for learning or formative evaluation. The paucity of research into this methodology in medical education suggests more research is needed. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044238300"

As institutions implement new preclerkship curricula to better prepare medical students to practice medicine in the context of modern healthcare systems, the perspective of clerkship leaders regarding clerkship student roles and potential for change will facilitate redefining these roles so that preclerkship educational innovations can continue into clerkships. Approach: In this qualitative exploratory study, authors conducted semistructured interviews with clerkship and site directors for eight core clerkships from April to May 2016. Questions addressed how clerkship leaders perceive current student roles and the potential for change. Through iterative consensus building, authors identified themes describing current ideal clerkship student roles applicable to future roles. Findings: Twenty-three of 24 (96%) directors participated. Findings fell into four themes: factors influencing the clerkship role, clerkship student role archetypes, workplace authenticity and value, and potential for change. Student, supervisor, and context factors determine the clerkship student role. Three role archetypes emerged: the apprentice (an assistant completing concrete patient care tasks), the academic (a researcher bringing literature back to the team), and the communicator (an interdisciplinary and patient liaison). Each archetype was considered authentic and valuable. Positive attitudes toward preclerkship curricular changes were associated with openness to evolution of the clerkship students' role. These emerging roles mapped to the archetypes. Insights: Clerkship leaders perceive that student, supervisor, and context factors result in varying emphasis on role archetypes, which in turn lead to different types of learning. Medical educators can use the archetypes to articulate how expanded student roles align learning with clinical needs, particularly as they relate to health systems science and inquiry. © 2018, This article not subject to U.S. copyright law.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042925630"

Community-based ambulatory settings can be more conducive to practicing these skills than highly specialized, academically based practice sites. The Association of American Medical Colleges and other national medical education organizations have expressed concern about recruitment and retention of preceptors to provide high-quality educational experiences in community-based practice sites. These concerns stem from constraints imposed by documentation in electronic health records; perceptions that student mentoring is burdensome resulting in decreased clinical productivity; and competition between allopathic, osteopathic, and international medical schools for finite resources for medical student experiences. Evidence: In this Alliance for Clinical Education position statement, we provide a consensus summary of representatives from national medical education organizations in 8 specialties that offer clinical clerkships. We describe the current challenges in providing medical students with adequate community-based instruction and propose potential solutions. Implications: Our recommendations are designed to assist clerkship directors and medical school leaders overcome current challenges and ensure high-quality, community-based clinical learning opportunities for all students. They include suggesting ways to orient community clinic sites for students, explaining how students can add value to the preceptor's practice, focusing on educator skills development, recognizing preceptors who excel in their role as educators, and suggesting forms of compensation. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964344756"

Findings: In total, 513 medical students (66% female) participated. Their mean age was 21 ± 1.6 years. Three hundred seventy-five students (73%) reported having visited a doctor at least once in the past 6 months. Fifty students (9.9%) admitted to having addictions. The overall prevalence of significant hypochondriacal concerns was 11.9% (61 students). The presence of addiction was associated with a greater likelihood of developing significant health-related anxiety (odds ratio = 3.82, p =.003), 95% confidence interval [1.51, 7.11]. Age, gender, medical school, year of medical school, and visits to the doctor in the previous 6 months were not associated with greater likelihood of developing significant health-related anxiety. Second-year medical students experienced a significantly greater degree of worry (MSD–Distress scale) than 5th-year students (M score = 12.6 ± 4.6 vs. 10.7 ± 4.4, p =.04). Insights: The prevalence of substantial hypochondriacal concerns in medical students in Pakistan was low in comparison to similar studies published in literature. Student health physicians should be aware of the true prevalence of hypochondriacal concerns and behavior and not dismiss legitimate complaints. Educational sessions to counteract this phenomenon can be incorporated into the curriculum of undergraduate medicine. By defining heightened awareness of symptoms as a normal process, different coping techniques can be discussed to help medical students reduce their level of stress. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964334430"

Understanding career choices among neurology residents, particularly decisions regarding subspecialty training, is critical, as neurologists with specialized knowledge can help meet the needs of patients with specific disease conditions. This study addresses the knowledge gap about subspecialty training decisions by examining factors associated with neurology residents' interest in pursuing subspecialty training and the types of subspecialty training neurology residents consider. Approach: We surveyed a geographically stratified sample of neurology residents in U.S. training programs using a two-stage survey design. In Stage 1, we randomly sampled half of the accredited neurology residency programs stratified by U.S. census region; Stage 2 involved a survey of neurology residents within these programs. Findings: The majority (approximately 81%) of residents expressed interest in subspecialty training. Resident demographic characteristics and educational debt did not influence interest in pursuing subspecialty training. Residents were more likely to express interest in subspecialty training when they participated in any neurology research (odds ratio [OR] = 2.39), 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.13, 5.07], p =.02, and indicated more interest in careers involving teaching (OR = 8.33), 95% CI [1.64, 42.19], p =.01. Considering the “medical content of subspecialty” as a more important factor approached but did not reach statistical significance (OR = 3.12), 95% CI [0.97, 10.06], p =.06. Insights: Participation in any neurology research and interest in careers involving teaching are associated with interest in subspecialty training among neurology residents. Further research is needed to determine whether exposure to research and teaching stimulates interest in subspecialty training and whether residents believe that subspecialty training is instrumental in pursuing an academic career. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928561073"

Despite mandates for end-of-life (EoL) care education, graduating medical students do not consistently feel prepared to provide this care. Intervention: We have developed a longitudinal, integrated, and developmental 4-year curriculum in EoL care. The curriculum's purpose is to teach basic competencies in EoL care. A variety of teaching strategies emphasize experiential, skill-building activities with special attention to student self-reflection. In addition, we have incorporated interprofessional learning and education on the spiritual and cultural aspects of care. We created blended learning strategies combining interactive online modules with live workshops that promote flexibility, adaptability, and interprofessional learning opportunities. Context: The curriculum was implemented and evaluated in the 4-year program of studies at Yale School of Medicine. Outcome: A mixed-method evaluation of the curriculum included reviews of student written reflections and questionnaires, graduating student surveys, and demonstration of 4th-year students’ competency in palliative care with an observed structured clinical examination (OSCE). These evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in students’ self-reported preparedness in EoL care and perceptions of the adequacy in their instruction in EoL and palliative care, as well as competency in primary palliative care in a newly developed OSCE. Lessons Learned: A 4-year longitudinal integrated curriculum enhances students’ skills and preparedness in important aspects of EoL care. As faculty resources, clinical sites, and curricular structure vary by institution, proven and adaptable educational strategies as described in this article may be useful to address the mandate to improve EoL care education. Teaching strategies and curricular components and design as just described can be adapted to other programs. © 2016, © Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963664615"

Little data exist to support the success of these specialized pathways in graduate medical education. Intervention: We present the 10-year experience of the Primary Care Medicine Education (PRIME) track, a clinical-outcomes research pathway for internal medicine residents at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). We hypothesized that participation in an individualized learning track, PRIME, would lead to a greater likelihood of publishing research from residency and accessing adequate career mentorship and would be influential on subsequent alumni careers. Context: We performed a cross-sectional survey of internal medicine residency alumni from UCSF who graduated in 2001 through 2010. We compared responses of PRIME and non-PRIME categorical alumni. We used Pearson's chi-square and Student's t test to compare PRIME and non-PRIME alumni on categorical and continuous variables. Outcome: Sixty-six percent (211/319) of alumni responded to the survey. A higher percentage of PRIME alumni published residency research projects compared to non-PRIME alumni (64% vs. 40%; p =.002). The number of PRIME alumni identifying research as their primary career role was not significantly different from non-PRIME internal medicine residency graduates (35% of PRIME vs. 29% non-PRIME). Process measures that could explain these findings include adequate access to mentors (M 4.4 for PRIME vs. 3.6 for non-PRIME alumni, p <.001, on a 5-point Likert scale) and agreeing that mentoring relationships affected career choice (M 4.2 for PRIME vs. 3.7 for categorical alumni, p =.001). Finally, 63% of PRIME alumni agreed that their research experience during residency influenced their subsequent career choice versus 46% of non-PRIME alumni (p =.023). Lessons Learned: Our results support the concept that providing residents with an individualized learning pathway focusing on clinical outcomes research during residency enables them to successfully publish manuscripts and access mentorship, and may influence subsequent career choice. Implementation of individualized residency program tracks that nurture academic interests along with clinical skills can support career development within medicine residency programs. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84965050394"

Errors are common and lead to patient harm. More effective methods for learning how to give and receive sign-out is an important public health priority. Evidence: Performing a handoff is a complex task. Trainees must simultaneously apply and integrate clinical, communication, and systems skills into one time-limited and highly constrained activity. The task demands can easily exceed the information-processing capacity of the trainee, resulting in impaired learning and performance. Appreciating the limits of working memory can help identify the challenges that instructional techniques and research must then address. Cognitive load theory (CLT) identifies three types of load that impact working memory: intrinsic (task-essential), extraneous (not essential to task), and germane (learning related). The authors generated a list of factors that affect a trainee's learning and performance of a handoff based on CLT. The list was revised based on feedback from experts in medical education and in handoffs. By consensus, the authors associated each factor with the type of cognitive load it primarily effects. The authors used this analysis to build a conceptual model of handoffs through the lens of CLT. Implications: The resulting conceptual model unpacks the complexity of handoffs and identifies testable hypotheses for educational research and instructional design. The model identifies features of a handoff that drive extraneous, intrinsic, and germane load for both the sender and the receiver. The model highlights the importance of reducing extraneous load, matching intrinsic load to the developmental stage of the learner and optimizing germane load. Specific CLT-informed instructional techniques for handoffs are explored. Intrinsic and germane load are especially important to address and include factors such as knowledge of the learner, number of patients, time constraints, clinical uncertainties, overall patient/panel complexity, interacting comorbidities or therapeutics, experience or specialty gradients between the sender and receiver, the maturity of the evidence base for the patient's disease, and the use of metacognitive techniques. Research that identifies which cognitive load factors most significantly affect the learning and performance of handoffs can lead to novel, contextually adapted instructional techniques and handoff protocols. The application of CLT to handoffs may also help with the further development of CLT as a learning theory. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954518751"

We were interested in whether this burden might contribute to well-described limitations in assessment judgments. In this study we examine the effect on indicators of rating quality of asking raters to (a) consider multiple competencies and (b) attend to multiple issues. In addition, we explored the cognitive strategies raters engage when asked to consider multiple competencies simultaneously. Hypotheses: We hypothesized that indications of rating quality (e.g., interrater reliability) would decline as the number of dimensions raters are expected to consider increases. Method: Experienced faculty examiners rated prerecorded clinical performances within a 2 (number of dimensions) × 2 (presence of distracting task) × 3 (number of videos) factorial design. Half of the participants were asked to rate 7 dimensions of performance (7D), and half were asked to rate only 2 (2D). The second factor involved the requirement (or lack thereof) to rate the performance of actors participating in the simulation. We calculated the interrater reliability of the scores assigned and counted the number of relevant behaviors participants identified as informing their ratings. Second, we analyzed data from semistructured posttask interviews to explore the rater strategies associated with rating under conditions designed to broaden raters' focus. Results: Generalizability analyses revealed that the 2D group achieved higher interrater reliability relative to the 7D group (G =.56 and.42, respectively, when the average of 10 raters is calculated). The requirement to complete an additional rating task did not have an effect. Using the 2 dimensions common to both groups, an analysis of variance revealed that participants who were asked to rate only 2 dimensions identified more behaviors of relevance to the focal dimensions than those asked to rate 7 dimensions: procedural skill = 36.2%, 95% confidence interval (CI) [32.5, 40.0] versus 23.5%, 95% CI [20.8, 26.3], respectively; history gathering = 38.6%, 95% CI [33.5, 42.9] versus 24.0%, 95% CI [21.1, 26.9], respectively; ps <.05. During posttask interviews, raters identified many sources of cognitive load and idiosyncratic cognitive strategies used to reduce cognitive load during the rating task. Conclusions: As intrinsic rating demands increase, indicators of rating quality decline. The strategies that raters engage when asked to rate many dimensions simultaneously are varied and appear to yield idiosyncratic efforts to reduce cognitive effort, which may affect the degree to which raters make judgments based on comparable information. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954570540"

The 2005 Sicily statement proposed a 5-step model of training in evidence-based practice (ask, access, appraise, apply, and assess). A key recommendation was that evidence-based practice should be incorporated into entry-level health professional training and registration. No previous research has assessed the extent to which this has occurred. Approach: We undertook a systematic audit of the accreditation documents for the registered health professions in Australia. The 11 health professional disciplines included in the audit were medicine, nursing and midwifery, pharmacy, physiotherapy, dentistry, psychology, occupational therapy, optometry, podiatry, osteopathy, and chiropractic. Two investigators independently identified the occurrence of the term evidence that related to “evidence-based practice” and the occurrences of terms related to the 5 steps in the accreditation documents. Findings: Occurrence of the term evidence as it relates specifically to “evidence-based practice” ranged from 0 (pharmacy, dentistry and occupational therapy) to 8 (physiotherapy) in the accreditation documents. Overall, there were 77 occasions when terms relating to any of the 5 steps of evidence-based practice were used across all 11 accreditation documents. All 5 steps were included in the physiotherapy and psychology documents; 4 steps in medicine and optometry; 3 steps in pharmacy; 2 steps each in documents for chiropractic, osteopathy, and podiatry; and 1 step for nursing. There was no inclusion of terms relating to any of the 5 steps in the dentistry and occupational therapy documents. Insights: Terminology relating explicitly to evidence-based practice and to the 5 steps of evidence-based practice appears to be lacking in the accreditation documents for health professions registered in Australia. This is not necessarily reflective of the curricular content or quality, or dedication to evidence-based practice teaching. However, recognition and demand by accreditation bodies for skills in evidence-based practice may act as a driver for education providers to give greater priority to embedding this training in entry-level programs. Consequently, accreditation bodies are powerfully positioned to shape future directions, focus, and boundaries within and across professions. Future international audits of accreditation documents could provide insight into the global breadth of this phenomenon and contribute to closer scrutiny of the representation of evidence-based practice in future iterations of accreditation documents. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954516460"

The mini clinical evaluation exercise (mini-CEX) is a tool that can facilitate direct observation and feedback. This study assessed the impact of a mini-CEX requirement across all 3rd-year clerkships on student report of direct observation by faculty and objectively measured clinical skills. Intervention: A mini-CEX requirement across all 3rd-year clerkships was implemented in the 2012–2013 academic year. The impact of the mini-CEX requirement on student report of direct observation was assessed by end-of-clerkship surveys and Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Graduation Questionnaire (GQ) items on direct observation. The impact on students' clinical skills was assessed by a summative Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). Pre/post comparisons were assessed with chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. Context: A mini-CEX requirement had been in place for the internal medicine clerkship, and student reports of direct observation were historically higher for the internal medicine clerkship than for other clerkships. Faculty, residents, and students at each of the clinical sites across all 6 clerkships were oriented to the use of the mini-CEX; the feasibility of its use during usual patient interaction settings and the importance of direct observation and feedback for student improvement were emphasized during these sessions. Outcome: Adherence to the mini-CEX requirement was high: 92% of required forms were completed, and 78% of completed forms indicated that specific feedback was given. The proportion of students reporting direct observation of physical examination significantly increased in all clerkships, with the largest relative increase occurring in surgery (from 49% to 87%), χ2(1, N = 225) = 37.70, p <.0001. Significant increases were seen in faculty observation of history taking in pediatrics, surgery, and psychiatry. Direct observation rates also increased on the AAMC GQ items for history taking and physical exam for all clerkships. Failures on the summative OSCE decreased from 12% preintervention to 2% postintervention (p =.0046). Lessons Learned: Institution of a mini-CEX requirement was feasible across all 3rd-year clerkships and was associated with a significant increase in student report of direct observation by faculty and a decrease in summative OSCE failure rates. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84965082306"

Medical students often do not seek help for mental health concerns. The use of approach coping strategies and social support has been shown in other populations to be related to mental health resiliency. Hypotheses: The rates of depression and burnout in this medical student population are expected to be high, with the majority not seeking help for their psychological distress in accordance with studies of medical students across the nation. Perceptions of stigma are hypothesized to be a potential source of this lack of care-seeking behavior. Approach coping strategies and social support are speculated to have an inverse relationship with the prevalence of depression and burnout in the medical student population. Method: Validated measures of depression and burnout along with items pertaining to diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues, specific coping strategies used during stressful times, and perceptions of social support were used in a cross-sectional study of students at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences (UND SMHS). Results: The overall survey response rate was 64%. Seventeen percent had moderate to severe depression, and 49% had burnout. Of depressed respondents, 81% were undiagnosed. When asked why depression develops, 23% responded that it was due to an inability to cope. A significantly greater risk of depression was associated with inadequate support from family and friends (p =.002), fellow medical students (p =.01), and the UND SMHS (p =.003). Greater use of approach-oriented coping strategies than avoidant-oriented strategies was associated with significantly decreased risk of burnout (p =.02) and was inversely correlated with depression (rs = −0.27, n = 153, p =.001). Conclusions: This study outlines associations among approach-oriented coping strategies, social support, and resiliency to mental health issues among medical students. This study also supports the existing literature that stigma regarding mental health issues is present in the medical community. Further multi-institutional, longitudinal research to delineate whether interventions that promote approach coping style and utilization of social support lead to decreased rates of mental health issues is necessary. The development of these interventions will need to be a multifaceted approach that includes promotion of care-taking behaviors but also focuses on institutional cultural change in order to empower students to participate in these resiliency strategies. © 2016, © Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963706102"

Intervention: The Program in Medical Education for the Urban Underserved (PRIME-US) is part of a family of programs across the University of California (UC) medical schools aiming to recruit and train physicians to care for underserved populations, expand the healthcare workforce to serve diverse populations, and promote health equity. PRIME-US selects medical students from diverse backgrounds who are committed to caring for underserved populations and provides a 5-year curriculum including a summer orientation, a longitudinal seminar series with community engagement and leadership-development activities, preclerkship clinical immersion in an underserved setting, a master's degree, and a capstone rotation in the final year of medical school. Context: This is a mixed-methods evaluation of the first 4 years of the PRIME-US at the UC Berkeley–UC San Francisco Joint Medical Program (JMP). From 2006 to 2010, focus groups were conducted each year with classes of JMP PRIME-US students, for a total of 11 focus groups; major themes were identified using content analysis. In addition, 4 yearly anonymous, online surveys of all JMP students, faculty and staff were conducted and analyzed. Outcome: Most PRIME-US students came from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds and ethnic backgrounds underrepresented in medicine, and all were committed to caring for underserved populations. The PRIME-US students experienced many program benefits including peer support, professional role models and mentorship, and curricular enrichment activities that developed their knowledge, skills, and sustained commitment to care for underserved populations. Non-PRIME students, faculty, and staff also benefited from participating in PRIME-sponsored seminars and community-based activities. Challenges noted by PRIME-US students and non-PRIME students, faculty, and staff included the stress of additional workload, perceived inequities in student educational opportunities, and some negative comments from physicians in other specialties regarding primary care careers. Lessons Learned: Over the first 4 years of the program, PRIME-US students and non-PRIME students, faculty, and staff experienced educational benefits consistent with the intended program goals. Long-term evaluation is needed to examine the participants' medical careers and impacts on California's healthcare workforce and patient outcomes. Attention should also be paid to the challenges of implementing new medical education enrichment programs. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928566763"

Background: The initial development of the O-SCORE produced evidence for valid results. Further work is required to determine if the use of a single surgeon or an unblinded rater introduces bias. In addition, the relationship of the O-SCORE to other currently used technical assessment tools should be explored to provide validity evidence related to the relationship to other measures. We have designed this project to provide continued validity evidence for the O-SCORE related to these two issues. Approach: Nineteen residents and 2 staff Orthopedic Surgeons from the University of Ottawa volunteered to participate in a 2-part OSCE style station. Participants completed a written questionnaire followed by a videotaped 10-minute simulated open reduction and internal fixation of a midshaft radius fracture. Videos were rated individually by 2 blinded staff orthopedic surgeons using an Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) global rating scale, an OSATS checklist, and the O-SCORE in random order. Results: O-SCORE results appeared sensitive to surgical training level even when raters were blinded. In addition, strong agreement between two independent observers using the O-SCORE suggests that the measure captures a performance easily recognized by surgical observers. Ratings on the O-SCORE also were strongly associated with global ratings on the currently most validated technical evaluation tool (OSATS). Collectively, these results suggest that the O-SCORE generates accurate, reproducible, and meaningful results when used in a randomized and blinded fashion, providing continued validity evidence for using this tool to evaluate surgical trainee competence. Conclusions: The O-SCORE was able to differentiate surgical trainee level using blinded raters providing further evidence of validity for the O-SCORE. There was strong agreement between two independent observers using the O-SCORE. Ratings on the O-SCORE also demonstrated equivalence to scores on the most validated technical evaluation tool (OSATS). These results suggest that the O-SCORE demonstrates accurate and reproducible results when used in a randomized and blinded fashion providing continued validity evidence for this tool in the evaluation of surgical competence in the trainees. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954567125"

Often a medical school's IT support for the education mission derives from isolated work units employing separate technologies that are not interoperable. Intervention: We launched a redesigned, tightly integrated, and novel IT infrastructure to support a completely revamped curriculum at the Vanderbilt School of Medicine. This system uses coordinated and interoperable technologies to support new instructional methods, capture students' effort, and manage feedback, allowing the monitoring of students' progress toward specific competency goals across settings and programs. Context: The new undergraduate medical education program at Vanderbilt, entitled Curriculum 2.0, is a competency-based curriculum in which the ultimate goal is medical student advancement based on performance outcomes and personal goals rather than a time-based sequence of courses. IT support was essential in the creation of Curriculum 2.0. In addition to typical learning and curriculum management functions, IT was needed to capture data in the learning workflow for analysis, as well as for informing individual and programmatic success. We aligned people, processes, and technology to provide the IT infrastructure for the organizational transformation. Outcomes: Educational IT personnel were successfully realigned to create the new IT system. The IT infrastructure enabled monitoring of student performance within each competency domain across settings and time via personal student electronic portfolios. Students use aggregated performance data, derived in real time from the portfolio, for mentor-guided performance assessment, and for creation of individual learning goals and plans. Poorly performing students were identified earlier through online communication systems that alert the appropriate instructor or coach of low quiz grades or missed learning goals. Graphical and narrative displays of a student's competency performance across courses and clinical experiences informed high-stake decisions made about student progress by the promotions committee. Similarly, graphical display of aggregate student outcomes provided education leaders with information needed to adjust and improve the curriculum. Lessons Learned: With the alignment of people, processes, and technology, educational IT can facilitate transformational steps in the training of medical students. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954474215"

The objective of this study was to assess residents’ rate of nontraumatic lumbar punctures, examine the adequacy of samples, and implement proper documentation of the procedure in an academic Level 4 Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. We hypothesize that traumatic taps are common and that documentation of the procedure is poor. Evidence: A retrospective chart review was done of infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit from January 2011 to November 2011 who underwent a lumbar puncture. Procedure notes were evaluated for completion of proper documentation, the lab specimen was assessed for red blood cell count less than 1,000 cells/mm3, and individuals were assessed for their ability to obtain a cerebrospinal fluid sample to send to the lab for analysis (i.e., sample of adequate volume and not clotted) and the total number of attempts to obtain a sample. A total of 184 charts were reviewed. Procedure notes were incomplete (58%) and lacked pertinent details. Eight percent of samples obtained had no record of the procedure being preformed. There was inadequate sample acquisition in 23% of the lumbar punctures. More than three attempts were noted in 14% of lumbar punctures performed. Many specimens contained very high red blood cell counts. Seventy-five percent of lumbar punctures with full documentation (n = 60), resulted in cerebrospinal fluid with more than 1,000 red blood cells/mm3 and 55% of underdocumented lumbar punctures resulted in cerebrospinal fluid with more than 1,000 red blood cells/mm3 (n = 71). Implications: We found that poorly documented lumbar punctures are common and the ability of residents to obtain satisfactory cerebrospinal fluid is low. The inability of residents to consistently perform nontraumatic lumbar punctures is likely a common phenomenon.

The theory behind decentralized clinical education is that academic and community sites will provide educational equivalency as determined by objective and subjective performance measures, while training more medical students and exposing students to rural or underserved communities. One of the major challenges of decentralized clinical education is ensuring site comparability in both learning opportunities and evaluation of students. Background: Previous research has examined objective measures of student performance, but less is known about subjective performance measures, particularly in the field of obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN). This study explores the implications of clinical site on the adequacy of subjective and objective performance measures. Approach: This was a retrospective cohort study of 801 students in the University of Washington School of Medicine OB/GYN clerkship from 2008 to 2012. Academic sites included those with OB/GYN residency programs (n = 2) and community sites included those without residency programs (n = 29). The association between clerkship site and National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) grade was assessed using linear regression and clinical and final grade using multinomial regression, estimating β coefficient and relative risks (RR), respectively, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for gender, academic quarter of clerkship, and year of clerkship. Results: There were no differences in NBME exam grades of students at academic sites (76.4 (7.3) versus 74.6 (8.0), β = –0.11, 95% CI [1.35, 1.12] compared to community sites. For clinical grade, students at community sites were 2.4 times more likely to receive honors relative to high pass (RR 2.45), 95% CI [1.72, 3.50], and for final grade, students at community sites were 1.9 times more likely to receive honors relative to pass (RR 1.98), 95% CI [1.27, 3.09], and 1.6 times more likely to receive honors relative to high pass (RR 1.62), 95% CI [1.05, 2.50], compared to those at academic sites. Conclusions: Students at community sites receive higher clinical and final grades in the OB/GYN clerkship. This highlights a significant challenge in decentralized clinical education—ensuring site comparability in clinical grading, Further work should examine the differences in sites, as well as improve standardization of clinical grading. This also underscores an important consideration, as the final grade can influence medical school rank, nomination into honor societies, and ranking of residency applicants. © 2016, © Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963705538"

It will also therefore contribute to the integrity of healthcare in the long run. Yet there is a paucity of research describing medical residents’ satisfaction in the Middle East, and there are no published studies that measure the satisfaction of medical residents trained within the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This makes it difficult to develop a quality residency training program that might meet the needs of both physicians and society. Approach: The authors designed a questionnaire to assess medical residents’ satisfaction with the Dubai residency training program in order to identify insufficiencies in the training, clinical, and educational aspects. The survey was a self-report questionnaire composed of different subscales covering sociodemographic and educational/academic profile of the residents along with their overall satisfaction of their training, curriculum, work environment, peer teamwork, and their personal opinion on their medical career. Findings: Respondents showed a substantial level of satisfaction with the residency training. The vast majority of residents (80%, N = 88) believe that their residency program curriculum and rotation was “good,” “very good,” or “excellent.” Areas of dissatisfaction included salary, excessive paperwork during rotations, and harassment. Insights: This is the first report that studies the satisfaction of medical residents in all specialties in Dubai, UAE. Our findings provide preliminary evidence on the efficiency of different modifications applied to the residency program in UAE. To our knowledge, there has not been any previous study in the Middle East that has analyzed this aspect of medical residents be used as a baseline to monitor the effectiveness of interventions applied in the future toward improving residency training programs in this region. © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954488988"

Some medical schools have incorporated point-of-care ultrasound training into their undergraduate curriculum, whereas many postgraduate programs have made ultrasound training a standard. The Chinese University of Hong Kong has charged its Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care to spearhead the introduction of ultrasound into the final-year medical curriculum by introducing handheld transthoracic echocardiography as part of perioperative assessment. Intervention: All 133 final-year students completed a 2-week anesthesia rotation, which began with a half-day session consisting of a lecture and hands-on practice session during which they learned 9 basic transthoracic echocardiography views using 4 basic ultrasound probe positions. Context: Each student was required to perform a transthoracic echocardiography-examine under supervision of 1 patient/week for 2 weeks, and their results were compared against that of the supervisor's. Most patients were elective cardiac surgery patients. One long question on transthoracic echocardiography was included in their end-of-year surgery examination paper. Students provided feedback on their experience. Outcome: Most students learned the basic transthoracic echocardiography views fairly efficiently and had variable, though generally favorable, success rates in identifying obvious cardiac anomalies, including use of color Doppler. A few common mistakes were identified but were easily correctable. Logistics for mobilizing enough bedside supervision were challenging. Students reported positive feedback on the teaching initiative. Lessons Learned: We were able to execute a successful short training course on transthoracic echocardiography during the final-year medical degree anesthesia rotation. Our initiative may set an example for other clinical departments to design similar courses pertinent to their specialties and syllabuses.

In this article, we aim to share the approach taken at a Portuguese medical school to promote a close connection between research and learning. Intervention: In a blended-learning approach, students studied research and scientific methods and undertook one of three faculty-supervised research and dissemination projects. To support immediate application of new research knowledge, students were offered optional short lectures and problem sets. All course information was featured on a website that also supported a discussion forum. We analyzed 1,350 theses leading to the medical degree, defended in six consecutive academic years (2007–2013). Our aim was to estimate the publication rates and factors associated with publication of the final-year undergraduate research projects. Context: The present research curriculum was developed at the University of Porto Faculty of Medicine as part of the Bologna process curriculum implemented in the 2007–2008 academic year. From May to June 2014 we looked for corresponding articles published over the period of September 2007 to April 2014. We searched PubMed, Scielo, Scopus, and IndexRMP databases to locate publications resulting from student theses. Outcomes: Over 6 years, the diffusion of knowledge produced by medical students, who engaged in clinical practice concurrently with research projects, was fairly low (10.4%). Program modifications that increased student accountability and engagement allowed for an increased rate of publication from 1.0% to 23.9%. Factors associated with publication were research area, publication as a performance assessment criterion, and publication language. Lessons Learned: The results of this study suggest that it is helpful to provide research opportunities that allow aspiring future medical doctors to begin their research careers. Further research is needed to understand difficulties students and supervisors face in project development and to achieve greater balance in topic coverage among projects and, consequently, in departmental involvement in the program. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84969902381"

Service-learning offers students the opportunity to engage with older adult communities and become more comfortable interacting with this population. Intervention: A preclinical elective course was developed to expand medical students' experiences in Geriatrics through service-learning. In this course, students conducted needs assessments in diverse older adult communities, created health education projects to address community-identified needs, and reflected on their experiences through written assignments and presentations. The course instructor presented lectures on special topics in Geriatrics, including ageism and health literacy. The curriculum aimed to familiarize students with older adults' needs in a variety of settings. Context: Over 3 years, 74 students participated in the service-learning course. Students were assigned to older adult community sites, where they conducted needs assessments and designed and implemented original educational projects targeting community concerns. Program evaluation methods included a validated survey assessing students' attitudes toward older adults, course evaluations, review of student assignments and projects, and feedback from older adult participants and site coordinators. Outcome: Students gained hands-on experience working with older adults and designing appropriate health education projects. Analysis of attitude surveys demonstrated students' increased interest in Geriatrics as a career. Both students and older adult participants described enjoyable, valuable experiences gained from service-learning activities. Lessons Learned: Students appreciated the combination of community and classroom learning about Geriatrics. Service-learning was most constructive at sites with responsive coordinators, engaged older adults, and a need for health education resources. The course challenged students to assess health needs in communities that included cognitively impaired elders and to design educational projects tailored to older adults. © 2016, © Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963682301"

The purpose of our study is to describe and validate a method of generating plausible but incorrect distractors. Initial applications of AIG demonstrated its effectiveness in producing test items. However, expert review of the initial items identified a key limitation where the generation of implausible incorrect options, or distractors, might limit the applicability of items in real testing situations. Background: Medical educators require development of test items in large quantities to facilitate the continual assessment of student knowledge. Traditional item development processes are time-consuming and resource intensive. Studies have validated the quality of generated items through content expert review. However, no study has yet documented how generated items perform in a test administration. Moreover, no study has yet to validate AIG through student responses to generated test items. Approach: To validate our refined AIG method in generating plausible distractors, we collected psychometric evidence from a field test of the generated test items. A three-step process was used to generate test items in the area of jaundice. At least 455 Canadian and international medical graduates responded to each of the 13 generated items embedded in a high-stake exam administration. Item difficulty, discrimination, and index of discrimination estimates were calculated for the correct option as well as each distractor. Results: Item analysis results for the correct options suggest that the generated items measured candidate performances across a range of ability levels while providing a consistent level of discrimination for each item. Results for the distractors reveal that the generated items differentiated the low- from the high-performing candidates. Conclusions: Previous research on AIG highlighted how this item development method can be used to produce high-quality stems and correct options for MCQ exams. The purpose of the current study was to describe, illustrate, and evaluate a method for modeling plausible but incorrect options. Evidence provided in this study demonstrates that AIG can produce psychometrically sound test items. More important, by adapting the distractors to match the unique features presented in the stem and correct option, the generation of MCQs using automated procedure has the potential to produce plausible distractors and yield large numbers of high-quality items for medical education. © 2016, © Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963661734"

Increasing reports are surfacing that highlight suicidal ideation and depression in medical school, residency training, and later professional practice. Implications: The purpose of this article is to draw attention to the problem of physician suicide with an emphasis on the role of medical education. Multiple accreditation bodies should be involved to effect a change in physician suicide prevalence. Thirty years have demonstrated that without mandates, large-scale change will not occur.

Hypotheses: Prior work has shown that clinical preceptors' use of conceptual frameworks (CFs; ways of thinking based on theories, best practices, or models) while giving feedback to residents was positively associated with a greater diversity of responses. Also, senior preceptors produced more responses, used more CFs, and asked more probing-challenging questions than junior preceptors. The purpose was to confirm the generalization of these initial findings with a broader and better defined sample of preceptors. Method: We conducted a mixed-method study with 20 junior and 20 senior preceptors in a controlled environment to analyze their responses and rationales to residents' educational needs as portrayed in 6 written vignettes. The preceptors were recruited from 3 primary care specialties preceptors (family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics) of the 3 French-speaking faculties of medicine in Québec, Canada. Results: The preceptors increased the 2012 list of response topics (96 to 126) and doubled the number of distinct CFs (16 to 32). The junior and senior preceptors expressed the same number and diversity of CFs. On average, senior preceptors asked more clarification questions and reflected more than juniors on the learning process that occurs during case discussions. Preceptor specialty and prior training in medical education did not influence the number and diversity of responses and CFs, except that preceptors with prior training generated more responses per vignette and were more reflective. Senior preceptors had a stronger positive relationship between the number of total and distinct CFs and the number of responses than the juniors. Conclusions: Although senior preceptors did not give more responses or use more CFs compared to the prior study, they continue to probe residents more and reflected more. The positive relationship between responses and CFs has important implications for faculty development and calls for more research to better understand the specific contribution of CFs to feedback.

Due to the current worldwide shortage of family physicians, these attitudes, with their subsequent effects on the state and dynamics of the healthcare system, are important to investigate. Approach: A web-based questionnaire was sent to 600 medical students, selected by a systematic random sampling technique, in 7 Egyptian medical schools. Participants were surveyed to assess their perception of the family medicine specialty as a future career and explore the impact of different factors, including undergraduate family medicine clerkships, on their attitudes toward family medicine. Findings: We had a response rate of 75.2% (n = 451). Although 90.7% of students believed in the vital role that family medicine can play in Egypt's healthcare system, only 4.7% showed an intention to choose it as a future career. Students choosing family medicine as a first-career choice were more likely to have a prior contact with family physicians as consumers. Exposure to an undergraduate family medicine curriculum was associated with increased knowledge about family medicine but not the intentions to pursue it as a career. Insights: Medical students in Egypt have a positive perception of family medicine as an important specialty but low interest in its choice as a future career.

Written comprehensive new patient admission notes (H&Ps) are a ubiquitous part of student education but are underutilized in the assessment of clinical skills. The interpretive summary, differential diagnosis, explanation of reasoning, and alternatives (IDEA) assessment tool was developed to assess students' clinical skills using written comprehensive new patient admission notes. Background: The validity evidence for assessment of clinical skills using clinical documentation following authentic patient encounters has not been well documented. Diagnostic justification tools and postencounter notes are described in the literature1,2 but are based on standardized patient encounters. To our knowledge, the IDEA assessment tool is the first published tool that uses medical students' H&Ps to rate students' clinical skills. Approach: The IDEA assessment tool is a 15-item instrument that asks evaluators to rate students' reporting, diagnostic reasoning, and decision-making skills based on medical students' new patient admission notes. This study presents validity evidence in support of the IDEA assessment tool using Messick's unified framework, including content (theoretical framework), response process (interrater reliability), internal structure (factor analysis and internal-consistency reliability), and relationship to other variables. Results: Validity evidence is based on results from four studies conducted between 2010 and 2013. First, the factor analysis (2010, n = 216) yielded a three-factor solution, measuring patient story, IDEA, and completeness, with reliabilities of.79,.88, and.79, respectively. Second, an initial interrater reliability study (2010) involving two raters demonstrated fair to moderate consensus (κ =.21–.56, ρ =.42–.79). Third, a second interrater reliability study (2011) with 22 trained raters also demonstrated fair to moderate agreement (intraclass correlations [ICCs] =.29–.67). There was moderate reliability for all three skill domains, including reporting skills (ICC =.53), diagnostic reasoning skills (ICC =.64), and decision-making skills (ICC =.63). Fourth, there was a significant correlation between IDEA rating scores (2010–2013) and final Internal Medicine clerkship grades (r =.24), 95% confidence interval (CI) [.15,.33]. Conclusions: The IDEA assessment tool is a novel tool with validity evidence to support its use in the assessment of students' reporting, diagnostic reasoning, and decision-making skills. The moderate reliability achieved supports formative or lower stakes summative uses rather than high-stakes summative judgments. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928542049"

Institutional differences have been inadequately investigated, as students who match into family medicine are often consolidated into the umbrella of primary care along with those matching in internal medicine and pediatrics. However, understanding medical school contexts in relation to career choice is critical toward designing targeted strategies to address the projected shortage of family physicians. This study examines factors associated with family medicine residency match rates and the extent to which such factors differ across medical school settings. Approach: We combined data from a survey of 123 departments of family medicine with graduate placement rates reported to the American Academy of Family Physicians over a 2-year period. Chi-square/Fisher's Exact texts, t tests, and linear regression analyses were used to identify factors significantly associated with average match rate percentages. Findings: The resulting data set included 85% of the U.S. medical schools with Departments of Family Medicine that reported 2011 and 2012 residency match rates in family medicine. Match rates in family medicine were higher among graduates of public than private medical schools—11% versus 7%, respectively, t(92) = 4.00, p <.001. Using a linear regression model and controlling for institutional type, the results indicated 2% higher match rates among schools with smaller annual clerkship enrollments (p  =.03), 3% higher match rates among schools with clerkships lasting more than 3 to 4 weeks (p  =.003), 3% higher match rates at schools with at least 1 family medicine faculty member in a senior leadership role (p  =.04), and 8% lower match rates at private medical schools offering community medicine electives (p <.001, R2 =.48), F(6, 64) = 9.95, p <.001. Three additional factors were less strongly related and varied by institutional type—informal mentoring, ambulatory primary care learning experiences, and institutional research focus. Insights: Educational opportunities associated with higher match rates in family medicine differ across private and public medical schools. Future research is needed to identify the qualitative aspects of educational programming that contribute to differences in match rates across institutional contexts. Results of this study should prove useful in mitigating physician shortages, particularly in primary care fields such as family medicine. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84965002350"

Although Korea has a reputation for having the highest quality medical practice in East Asia, improvements in the technological aspects of care have outpaced the developments in institutional systems and education needed to fulfill social responsibility. Enhancing professionalism education during postgraduate training requires thorough exposition of this situation. Approach: Twenty residents from 17 clinical departments at 1 Korean tertiary university-affiliated hospital were recruited, and in-depth interviews were conducted in person by an interviewer who was a fellow resident with participants. Interviewees recalled and described personal experiences or observations of misbehaviors that had occurred during their residency training. Researchers recorded and transcribed all interviews, and 4 researchers conducted a thematic analysis. Findings: Authors extracted 48 descriptors representing 8 categories of unethical and unprofessional behaviors from the transcripts: (a) substandard practice, (b) violation of work ethics, (c) misconduct related to conflict of interest, (d) dishonesty with patients, (e) violation of patient confidentiality, (f) lack of respect for patients, (g) lack of respect for colleagues, and (h) misconduct in research. Each of the interviewees mentioned between 3 and 18 descriptors. “Not fulfilling basic duties for patient care” was the most frequently mentioned misconduct, followed by “fabricating patient medical status or test results to meet preoperative criteria for anesthesia” and “verbal or physical abuse of junior doctors.” Insights: Residents reported a diverse variety of unethical and unprofessional behaviors throughout their training and described the ethical distress they suffered in the real clinical situations. The results of this study support the notion that reinforcing ethics and professionalism education during postgraduate medical training in a practical and authentic way will help trainees manage the ethical conflicts or dilemmas they will inevitably encounter. © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954527055"

There is concern that residents are at risk of receiving inadequate training due to the low number of operations they perform. In Brazil, although all GS residents receive by law the Board Certification at the end of their programs, the assessment of their technical skills is not mandatory in Medical Residency programs’ training. Consequently, our concern was that current GS medical residency format might be insufficient to create competent and autonomous general surgery residents after 2 years of regular training. Hence, the aim was to assess GS residents’ surgical skills in their final months of training to evaluate the present format of GS residency programs in Brazil. Approach: Trained surgical faculty members directly observed 11 operations of varying difficulty performed by 2nd-year regular GS residents and by 4th-year residents in the optional Advanced Program in General Surgery. Participants were located at 3 university and 3 nonuniversity hospitals in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo (Brazil's largest cities). Surgical skills were assessed using an internally developed observation checklist reviewed by subject matter experts. Findings: Sixty residents (46 regular 2nd-year trainees and 14 advanced 4th-year trainees) were assessed on performing 499 operations. Only 10 residents (17%), all advanced 4th-year residents, satisfactorily performed all operations and were considered eligible for the Board Certification. Even after excluding the 2 operations of greatest difficulty, only 24 regular 2nd-year residents (52%) satisfactorily performed the other 9 operations. Residents from hospitals with open Emergency Departments performed better than those from hospitals without Emergency Departments. Insights: The results of this pilot study suggest that residents with 2 years of training are not prepared for independent high-level surgical practice. The current formatting of regular GS residency programs in Brazil (2 years) may be insufficient to train experts in general surgery. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964018588"

Most prematriculation programs focus on academic preparation and are in urban areas, potentially adding to urban disruption. Most initial learning experiences concerning communication with patients are also in urban areas. Intervention: Fifty-nine rural preclinical students completed a 3-week summer rural prematriculation program from 2009 to 2014. The focus was on learning a holistic approach to interviewing patients and experiential learning based in a rural practice. Group reflection sessions focused on understanding health beliefs, psychosocial details of the patient’s life, and the importance of the sense of place. Measures included student reports, program evaluations, and a pre- and post-10-item opinion survey focused on the students’ perceived importance of traditional biomedical and psychosocial knowledge. Context: The program was based at the Trover Campus, a regional clinical campus of the University of Louisville School of Medicine, in a town of 20,000 in the western Kentucky coalfields that is 150 miles from the main urban campus. Practice site assignments were in surrounding medically underserved towns in family medicine practices. Outcome: After the 3-week experience, students became comfortable with interviews concerning health habits using the Prochaska model of lifestyle modification and expressed an increased importance of some psychosocial factors and a corresponding decrease in importance of traditional biomedical factors in choosing treatment for an individual patient (significant results by Mann-Whitney, two-tailed, ranged U = 1136.0, p = .001 to U = 1377.5, p ≤ .05). Student reports showed that the students gained a new detailed understanding of rural practice. Students also expressed an appreciation for having developed a support network of fellow rural students with whom they would begin medical school on the urban campus. Lessons Learned: These results support the value of a summer prematriculation program for rural students based in a rural area. New appreciation for psychosocial patient factors, new skills in communication with patients, new understanding of the details of rural practice, and new relationships with other rural classmates were perceived as positive aspects of the program. Longer term measures of whether the program decreased urban disruption significantly will require continued tracking of the students until they make a practice choice 7 to 9 years later. Wider collaboration with other medical school rural programs is necessary to determine which aspects of rural-focused training are most effective. © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954475248"

Yet no consensus exists regarding what a core skill set comprises or how to measure skill performance. Defining a core skill set and relevant metrics would help surgical educators evaluate different simulators. Approach: This review draws from published research to propose a core technical skill set for using the da Vinci surgeon console. Publications on three commercial simulators were used to evaluate the simulators’ content addressing these skills and associated metrics. Findings: An analysis of published research suggests that a core technical skill set for operating the surgeon console includes bimanual wristed manipulation, camera control, master clutching to manage hand position, use of third instrument arm, activating energy sources, appropriate depth perception, and awareness of forces applied by instruments. Validity studies of three commercial virtual reality simulators for robot-assisted surgery suggest that all three have comparable content and metrics. However, none have comprehensive content and metrics for all core skills. Insights: Virtual reality simulation remains a promising tool to support skill training for robot-assisted surgery, yet existing commercial simulator content is inadequate for performing and assessing a comprehensive basic skill set. The results of this evaluation help identify opportunities and challenges that exist for future developments in virtual reality simulation for robot-assisted surgery. Specifically, the inclusion of educational experts in the development cycle alongside clinical and technological experts is recommended. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921295167"

Admission interventions that substantially reduce the level of academic aptitude are also likely to result in reduced professional performance. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928521515"

Hypotheses: Self-reported stress and quality of life among sophomore medical students having different types of preclinical curricula will vary in their relationships to USMLE Step 1 scores. Method: Voluntary surveys in 2010 and 2011 compared self-reported stress, physical and mental health, and quality of life with Step 1 scores for beginning sophomore students in the final year of a traditional, discipline-based curriculum and the 1st year of a revised, systems-based curriculum with changed grading system. Wilcoxon rank sum tests and Spearman rank correlations were used to analyze data, significant at p <.05. Results: New curriculum students reported worse physical health, subjective feelings, leisure activities, social relationships and morale, and more depressive symptoms and life stress than traditional curriculum students. However, among curriculum-related stressors, few differences emerged; revised curriculum sophomores reported less stress working with real and standardized patients than traditional students. There were no class differences in respondents’ Step 1 scores. Among emotional and physical health measures, only feelings of morale correlated negatively with Step 1 performance. Revised curriculum students’ Step 1 scores correlated negatively with stress from difficulty of coursework. Conclusions: Although revised curriculum students reported worse quality of life, general stress, and health and less stress from patient interactions than traditional students, few measures were associated with performance differences on Step 1. Moreover, curriculum type did not appear to either hinder or help students’ Step 1 performance. To identify and help students at risk for academic problems, future assessments of correlates of Step 1 performance should be repeated after the new curriculum is well established, relating them also to performance on other standardized assessments of communication skills, professionalism, and later clinical evaluations in clerkships or internships. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921307832"

Peer-led programs have not been formally assessed in a medical student population, where psychological issues exist and where it has been shown that students approach peers for help in preference to staff members or professional services. Intervention: Medical students elected peer leaders who underwent training and then provided the intervention. The peer leaders provided support to students in the intervention group, as well as offering teaching in mindfulness meditation. Context: An exploratory study was conducted with 2nd- and 3rd-year medical students at 1 medical school in New Zealand randomized into 2 groups. In addition to existing mental health resources, intervention participants received a program including peer support and peer-taught mindfulness practice. Study participants not offered the intervention participants could use existing mental health resources. Primary measures included depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) scores. Secondary measures were quality of life, resilience (15-item resilience scale), academic self-concept, and motivation to learn, assessed at baseline and 6 months. Outcome: Of the 402 students eligible, 275 (68%) participated and 232 (58%) completed the study. At baseline, 53% were female and mean age was 21 years (SD = 3)—PHQ-9 score (M = 5.2, SD = 3.7) and GAD-7 score (M = 4.5, SD = 3.4). Twelve peer leaders were elected. There was good participation in the intervention. One fourth of intervention students used the face-to-face peer support and more than 50% attended a peer social event and/or participated in the mindfulness program. Although improvements in mental health were seen in the intervention group, the difference between the intervention and nonintervention groups did not reach statistical significance. Lessons Learned: Although evidence exists for effectiveness of peer support and mindfulness in other contexts, this exploratory study was not able to show a statistically significant effect. Future studies could consider using a longer training period for the peer leaders, as well as targeting the study population to those most likely to benefit such as those with poorer mental health, or using a more intensive intervention or larger sample size. A cluster randomized study design would also reduce the risk of contamination. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964330123"

This means their usefulness for reporting on student achievement is also not well documented. This study investigates grade reliability within 1 medical school. Approach: Generalizability analyses are conducted on grades awarded. Grades from didactic and clerkship-based courses were treated as 2 levels of a fixed facet within a univariate mixed model. Grades from within the 2 levels (didactic and clerkship) were also entered in a multivariate generalizability study. Results: Grades from didactic courses were shown to produce a highly reliable mean score (G =.79) when averaged over as few as 5 courses. Although the universe score correlation between didactic and clerkship courses was high (r =.80), the clerkship courses required almost twice as many grades to reach a comparable level of reliability. When grades were converted to a Pass/Fail metric, almost all information contained in the grades was lost. Conclusions: Although it has been suggested that the imprecision of medical school grades precludes their use as a reliable indicator of student achievement, these results suggest otherwise. While it is true that a Pass/Fail system of grading provides very little information about a student's level of performance, a multi-tiered grading system was shown to be a highly reliable indicator of student achievement within the medical school. Although grades awarded during the first 2 didactic years appear to be more reliable than clerkship grades, both yield useful information about student performance within the medical college. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964355583"

Intervention: We developed a 1- and 2-hour workshop curriculum for internal medicine residents to promote shared decision making in treatment decisions for four common chronic conditions: diabetes, depression, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The workshops included a written case exercise, a short didactic presentation on shared decision-making concepts and strategies for risk communication, and two role-playing exercises focused on decision making for depression and hyperlipidemia treatment. Context: We delivered the workshop as a required component of the resident curriculum in ambulatory medicine. To evaluate the impact of the workshop, we used written course evaluations, tracked the use of the newly introduced Decision Worksheets, and asked preceptors to perform direct observation of treatment decision conversations. Outcome: Residents were involved in the development of the workshop and helped identify key content, suggested framing for difficult topics, and confirmed the need for the skills workshop. One hundred thirty internal medicine and medicine-pediatrics residents attended 8 workshops over a 4-month period. In written cases completed before the workshop, the majority of residents indicated that they would discuss medications, but few mentioned other treatment options or documented patients’ goals and preferences in a sample encounter note with a patient with new depression symptoms. Overall, most participants (89.7%) rated the workshop as excellent or very good, and 93.5% said that they would change their practice based on what they learned. Decision Worksheets addressing diabetes, depression, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension were available on a primary care-focused intranet site and were downloaded almost 1,200 times in the first 8 months following the workshops. Preceptors were able to observe only one consult during which one of the four topics was discussed. Lessons Learned: Internal medicine residents had considerable gaps in shared decision-making skills as measured in a baseline written exercise. Residents provided valuable contributions to the development of a Decision Worksheet to be used at the point of care. Participants rated the skills workshop highly, though interns rated the exercise more useful than PGY-2 and PGY-3 residents did. The Decision Worksheets were accessed often following the sessions; however, observing the Decision Worksheets in use in real time was a challenge in the resident-faculty clinic. Additional studies are warranted to examine whether the workshop was successful in increasing residents’ ability to implement skills in practice. © 2016, © Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963706124"

Background: The objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) was established for valid, reliable, and objective assessment of clinical skills in health professions education. Various standard setting methods have been proposed to identify objective, reliable, and valid cutoff scores on OSCEs. These methods may identify different cutoff scores for the same examinations. Identification of valid and reliable cutoff scores for OSCEs remains an important issue and a challenge. Approach: Thirty OSCE stations administered at least twice in the years 2010–2012 to 393 medical students in Years 2 and 3 at Aga Khan University are included. Psychometric properties of the scores are determined. Cutoff scores and pass/fail decisions of Wijnen, Cohen, Mean–1.5SD, Mean–1SD, Angoff, borderline group and borderline regression (BL-R) methods are compared with each other and with three variants of cluster analysis using repeated measures analysis of variance and Cohen's kappa. Results: The mean psychometric indices on the 30 OSCE stations are reliability coefficient = 0.76 (SD = 0.12); standard error of measurement = 5.66 (SD = 1.38); coefficient of determination = 0.47 (SD = 0.19), and intergrade discrimination = 7.19 (SD = 1.89). BL-R and Wijnen methods show the highest convergent validity evidence among other methods on the defined criteria. Angoff and Mean–1.5SD demonstrated least convergent validity evidence. The three cluster variants showed substantial convergent validity with borderline methods. Conclusions: Although there was a high level of convergent validity of Wijnen method, it lacks the theoretical strength to be used for competency-based assessments. The BL-R method is found to show the highest convergent validity evidences for OSCEs with other standard setting methods used in the present study. We also found that cluster analysis using mean method can be used for quality assurance of borderline methods. These findings should be further confirmed by studies in other settings.

Switzerland’s changing demographics highlight the importance of provider cross-cultural preparedness for all patients—especially those at risk for social/health precarity. We evaluated healthcare provider cross-cultural preparedness for commonly encountered vulnerable patient profiles. Approach: A survey on cross-cultural care was mailed to Lausanne University hospital’s “front-line healthcare providers”: clinical nurses and resident physicians at our institution. Preparedness items asked “How prepared do you feel to care for... ?” (referring to example patient profiles) on an ascending 5-point Likert scale. We examined proportions of “4 well/5-very well prepared” and the mean composite score for preparedness. We used linear regression to examine the adjusted effect of demographics, work context, cultural-competence training, and cross-cultural care problem awareness, on preparedness. Findings: Of 885 questionnaires, 368 (41.2%) were returned: 124 (33.6%) physicians and 244 (66.4%) nurses. Mean preparedness composite was 3.30 (SD = 0.70), with the lowest proportion of healthcare providers feeling prepared for patients “whose religious beliefs affect treatment” (22%). After adjustment, working in a sensitized department (β = 0.21, p = .01), training on the history/culture of a specific group (β = 0.25, p = .03), and awareness regarding (a) a lack of practical experience caring for diverse populations (β = 0.25, p = .004) and (b) inadequate cross-cultural training (β = 0.18, p = .04) were associated with higher preparedness. Speaking French as a dominant language and physician role (vs. nurse) were negatively associated with preparedness (β = ¡0.26, p = .01; β = ¡0.22, p = .01). Insights: The state of cross-cultural care preparedness among Lausanne’s front-line healthcare providers leaves room for improvement. Our study points toward institutional strategies to improve preparedness: notably, making sure departments are sensitized to cross-cultural care resources and increasing provider diversity to reflect the changing Swiss demographic. © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954514724"

The preparation process for the specialty exam and the effect of this process on the students’ anxiety has not been studied comprehensively. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the interns’ preparation time for the specialty exam, their perception of how the preparation process affects their training, and which factors are related to their test anxiety. Approach: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 6th-year students (interns). A questionnaire asked participants to report health status, academic achievement, exam-related anxiety, and trait anxiety. Two open-ended questions asked about views regarding the specialty exam. Multiple linear regression was used to identify the significant predictors of anxiety level due to the exam. Findings: The average duration of exam preparations of participating interns (n = 214) was 16.8 months and 14.3 hours/week. Participating interns’ health status, economic level, perception of academic achievement, time allocated to study for the exam, time remaining until the exam, and trait anxiety level demonstrated a relationship with anxiety level due to the exam (R =.35, R2 =.13, p <.001). In the open-ended questions, the most frequent opinion regarding the importance of the Examination for Specialty in Medicine was “Value attributed to specialization” (43%). The most frequent response regarding the contribution of studying for the specialty exam to their general professional skills was “Rehearsal/recall.” Insights: Participating interns spent an appreciable amount of time preparing for the specialty exam. Although participating interns value this exam, they appear to believe that preparing for it will contribute only moderately to their professional competencies, while increasing their anxiety level. The internship curriculum, requirements, and timing of the specialty exam should be reconsidered. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921278395"

Faculty and student feedback suggests that supervisor/student interactions may now be more cursory with increasing numbers of supervisors per student, and shorter duration of interaction. This may affect both education and student assessment. Approach: We compared inpatient attending and resident daily schedules with those of 3rd- and 4th-year medical students rotating on medicine clerkships at Brigham and Women's Hospital during academic years 2009–11 to determine the number of days of overlap. We used evaluation forms to determine the extent of evaluator's self-reported knowledge of the student. Findings: We correlated the daily schedules of 199 students and 204 resident and 187 attending physicians, which resulted in 558 resident–student pairings and 680 attending–student pairings over 2 years. During a 4-week block, students averaged 3.7 attending physicians (M = 4, range = 2–7), with 49.7% supervised by 4 or more. Attending-student overlap averaged 9 days (M = 9, range = 2–23), though 40% were 7 days or less. Students overlapped with an average 3.4 residents (M = 3, range = 1–6). Resident-student overlap averaged 12 days (M = 11, range = 3–26). There were 824 student assessment forms analyzed. Resident and attending physician supervisors describing knowledge of their student as “good/average” overlapped with students for 14 and 11 days respectively compared to resident and physician supervisors who described their knowledge as “poor” (11 days, p <.01; 6 days, p <.01). Insights: On the inpatient medicine clerkship, students have multiple supervising physicians with wide variability in the period of overlap. This leads to a disrupted apprenticeship model with fragmentation of supervision and concomitant effects on assessment, feedback, role modeling, and clerkship education. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928555692"

As a result there is a high demand from medical students for formative MCQs. However, teaching staff rarely have the time or incentive to develop high-quality formative questions, focusing instead on material for high-stakes assessments. Intervention: We have developed a novel student-led approach involving an interactive online question database, created by medical students for medical students. We adopted a staged approach to create an online bank of formative MCQ questions. First, students write MCQs following a standardized format. Questions are then peer-reviewed by other students, discussing relevant clinical topics, guidelines, and journals to improve question quality. The questions are then scrutinized by specialist doctors and academics. Next, questions are piloted online. Finally, question performance is evaluated statistically. This 5-stage student-led process produced a bank of more than 200 MCQs in three months. Context: This intervention was carried out by two final-year medical student leads at Cardiff University School of Medicine, UK. Final-year students were recruited to write and peer-review questions, and senior content specialists were recruited from the department. After piloting and evaluation of the questions, the question bank was made available as a learning resource to all medical students at Cardiff University. Outcome: Objective analysis of the created MCQs (discrimination indices and distractor analysis) indicated that the random sample of questions piloted were of high quality. When the questions were made available as online tests to approximately 600 students, usage data revealed that 2,800 tests were taken over a 3-month period, indicating that the resource was popular. In addition, subjective feedback from students question writers/reviewers was gathered via free text feedback forms and was invariably positive. We plan to continue the question generation process in Cardiff and would encourage other medical schools to adopt this approach. Lessons Learned: Our 5-stage approach can generate a large volume of high-quality MCQs, addressing the demand from students for formative MCQ questions, with minimal teaching staff input. The project's benefits go beyond the creation of the resource, as involving students in the writing, review, and presentation of questions itself is useful pedagogically. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928575165"

Hypotheses: Prior exposure to test questions may lead to contamination and inflated scores. This research seeks to detect if examinees’ scores were inflated due to prior exposure to test questions and, if so, whether those increases were significant. Method: The sample for this study consisted of candidates who took the American Board of Family Medicine’s certification examination twice in a single year (n D 988). Examinees were randomly assigned one of two forms for their first attempt and received the other form for their repeat test. There were 99 questions in common across both forms. The Rasch model was used to estimate examinee ability. Performance changes on the common questions and unique questions were compared and repeated measures t tests were performed to establish whether score changes were likely to have occurred by chance. Results: On average, the examinees increased their overall ability estimate by.187 logits on the repeat attempt. The repeated measures t tests indicate this difference was statistically significant, t(987) D ¡25.298, p <.001, a D.05. The mean difference between the examinees’ ability estimate on common and unique items for their first attempt was not statistically significant, t(987) D.264, p D.792, a D.05; however, the mean difference between common and unique items on the second attempt (0.029 logits) was statistically significant, t(987) D 3.28, p D.001, a D.05. Conclusions: Some of the increase in the examinees’ overall ability estimate may attributed to a general increase in the latent trait; however, there was a small but detectable increase that could be attributed to prior exposure to the questions. On average, about 15% of the repeated questions were changed from wrong to right, but about 11% of questions. were changed from right to wrong, suggesting that examinees may occasionally be using prior exposure to their benefit but general guessing accounts for more of the changes. The impact of the mean difference between the common and unique item scores (0.029 logits) is trivial at the individual level; however, such a bias among the population of repeat testers could be problematic if a small subset of examinees were using a “remember-researchretest” strategy to obtain nontrivial score increases. © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954485694"

Background: Valid and reliable rating of teaching effectiveness is helpful for providing faculty with feedback. The 25-item Stanford Faculty Development Program Tool on Clinical Teaching Effectiveness was intended to evaluate seven dimensions of clinical teaching. Confirmation of the structure of this tool has not been previously performed. Approach: This study sought to validate this tool using a confirmatory factor analysis, testing a 7-factor model and compared its goodness of fit with a modified model. Acceptability of the use of the tool was assessed using a 6-item survey, completed by final year medical students (N = 119 of 156 students; 76%). Results: The testing of the goodness of fit indicated that the 7-factor model performed poorly, χ2(254) = 457.4, p <.001 (root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = 0.08, comparative fit index [CFI] = 0.91, non-normed fit index [NNFI] = 0.89). Only standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) indicated acceptable fit (0.06). Further exploratory analysis identified 10 items that cross-loaded on 2 factors. The remainder of the items loaded on factors as originally intended. By removing these 10 items, repeat confirmatory factor analysis on the modified 15-item, 5-factor model demonstrated a better fit than the original model: SRMR = 0.075, NNFI = 0.91, χ2(80) = 150.1, p <.001; RMSEA = 0.09; CFI = 0.93. Although 75% of the participants stated they were willing to fill the tool on their preceptors on a biweekly basis, only 25% were willing to do so on a weekly basis. Conclusions: Our study failed to confirm factor structure of the 25-item tool. A modified tool with fewer, more conceptually distinct items was best fit by a 5-factor model. Further, the acceptability of use for the 25-item tool may be poor for rotations with a new preceptor weekly. The abbreviated tool may be preferable in that setting. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928560471"

However, there has been a dearth of empirical work aimed at modifying risk factors for psychopathology among this at-risk group. Distress tolerance, defined as the ability to withstand emotional distress, is one factor that may be important in promoting psychological well-being in medical students. Thus, the aim of the current mixed-methods study was (a) to describe changes in facets of distress tolerance (i.e., emotional tolerance, absorption, appraisal, regulation) for medical students who completed a mind–body skills training group, and a no-intervention control group of students; (b) to examine the relationship between changes in psychological variables and changes in distress tolerance; and (c) to report students' perceptions of the mind–body group, with an emphasis on how the group may have affected personal and professional functioning due to improvements in distress tolerance. Intervention: The mind–body program was an 11-week, 2-hour skills training group that focused on introducing, practicing, and processing mind–body skills such as biofeedback, guided imagery, relaxation, several forms of meditation (e.g., mindfulness), breathing exercises, and autogenic training. Context: Participants were 52 first- and second-year medical students (62.7% female, Mage = 23.45, SD = 1.51) who participated in a mind–body group or a no-intervention control group and completed self-report measures before and after the 11-week period. Outcome: Students in the mind–body group showed a modest improvement in all distress tolerance subscales over time (ΔM =.42–.53, p =.01–.03, d =.44–.53), whereas the control group showed less consistent changes across most subscales (ΔM =.11–.42, p =.10–.65, d =.01–.42). Students in the mind–body group qualitatively reported an improved ability to tolerate affective distress. Overall, improvements in psychological symptoms were associated with improvements in distress tolerance in the mind–body group but not in the control group. Lessons Learned: These preliminary findings provide support for the notion that improving distress tolerance through mind–body skills training might serve to protect medical students from becoming functionally impaired by psychological distress. Thus, implementing mind–body skills training into medical school education may help to improve the psychological well-being of medical students. Future studies utilizing more methodologically rigorous designs are warranted. © 2016, © Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963642461"

In the Netherlands, all General Practitioner training programs include regular meetings called Exchange of Experiences, in which General Practitioner trainees are expected to learn collaboratively from their own and one another's experiences. Despite this being common practice, we found little research into the structure and process of these sessions. The purpose of this study is to describe the structure and characteristics of group reflection by describing transitions in interactions. We aim to describe the tutor's role in some detail, as this could lead to faculty development. Approach: In medical education, reflection is often approached from a cognitive perspective. However, learning in a group is also an interactional achievement. It is therefore relevant to study the sequential nature of group interaction in collaborative reflective practice. We have used conversation analysis to study the reflection meetings, zooming in on the transition between case presentation and discussion, focusing on the role of each of the participants in these transitions. Findings: The transitions were conversationally complex. Three interactional aspects recurred in the meetings. First, the transitions can be characterized as ambiguous, as there is ambiguity about what will happen next and the floor is open. Second, transitions are an arena for negotiations between case presenter, participants, and tutors, in which knowledge and the right to take the floor (epistemics) play an important part. Third, the tutor can have different interactional roles, namely, that of teacher, expert, facilitator, and active participant. The role of the tutor is important as the tutor's interactional behavior is part of the hidden curriculum. Insights: Conversation analysis focuses on the interaction in group learning and shows how the interaction is part of what is learned and how learning takes place. Transitions are the “messy” moments in interaction yet can tell a lot about the way in which group participants relate to one another. Being conscious of how the floor is taken, the tutor's roles, and the way negotiations take place could help medical educators in the way they shape collaborative learning sessions. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954477005"

In a small-group learning setting, students uninterested or not ready for a particular learning topic might change the educational experience (“poison the well”) for those students most interested in the topic. It is not known how medical students required to take a course in humanism (that they otherwise would not have elected to take) might be impacted by the course or how their presence might affect students originally interested in the course. Hypotheses: Medical students in a required course on humanism and values in medicine will have different experiences based on whether a particular student might have or not have elected to enroll in the course. Students uninterested in taking a course in humanism and values, but required to enroll, will limit the benefit of the course for those students originally interested in participating. Method: In 2012, all 1st-year students at a U.S. medical school were required to take the Healer's Art, an elective on professional values and humanism offered at more than 90 other schools in the United States and internationally. Students completed pre/postcourse surveys assessing emotional exhaustion, work engagement, positive emotions, and cynicism. We analyzed differences between those who would have elected to take the course (Elective students) and those who would not have elected to take it (Required students). Results: Elective students did not differ from Required students in baseline demographic characteristics, emotional exhaustion, work engagement, or positive emotions. At baseline, Elective students did report feeling safer to talk openly, a greater sense of community, and higher levels of cynicism. Over time, there were no differences in course evaluations or outcomes between Elective and Required students. Conclusions: Required students do not differ greatly from those who would have elected to take Healer's Art, and all students appear to have similar experiences in the course. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954511642"

This MR-EBM comprises 10 elements of knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) representing our institutional learning goals of career-spanning engagement with EBM. An MR also includes developmental trajectories for each KSA, beginning with medical school coursework, including residency training, and outlining the qualifications of individuals to teach and mentor in EBM. The development was not part of the validation effort, as our curriculum is focused at a single stage (undergraduate medical students). Background: An MR comprises the desired KSAs for an entire curriculum, together with descriptions of a learner's performance and/or capabilities as they develop from novice to proficiency of the curricular target(s). The MR construct is intended to support curriculum development or refinement by capturing the KSAs that support the articulation of concrete learning goals; it also promotes assessment that demonstrates development in the target KSAs and encourages reflection and self-directed learning throughout the learner's career. Two other MRs have been published, and this is the first one specific to teaching and learning in medicine; this is also the first one created specifically to evaluate an existing curriculum. Approach: To validate the dispersion of the elements of the EBM curriculum, the nine clinical instructors in the EBM two-course curriculum completed an MDS exercise, rating the similarities of the 10 curricular elements. MDS is a mathematical approach to understanding relationships among concepts/objects when these relationships are difficult to quantify. Eliciting similarity ratings biased the responses toward the null hypothesis (that the elements are not different). Results: MDS results suggested that the MR represents 10 different, although related, facets of the construct “evidence-based medicine.” The results support the makeup of the MR-EBM, and its use to revise our EBM curriculum so that it is more closely aligned with this MR. Conclusions: An MR is a tool, and the MR-EBM that we describe can be useful to develop or evaluate a curriculum in EBM.

Medical student notes are like college essays—both are persuasive compositions. But attending physicians rarely scrutinize student notes like college professors analyze essays. This is a missed opportunity to teach clinical reasoning. Evidence: A survey at our institution showed that only 16% of students received written feedback and 31% received oral feedback on their notes from more than 3 attending physicians during the first 8 months of 3rd-year clerkships. Many studies have reported a paucity of feedback across multiple domains and a sense among students that clinical reasoning is not being adequately taught during clerkships. Meanwhile, college professors teach written composition and reasoning through interactive methods that help students to develop structured, well-reasoned arguments. A recent study showed that 85% of Oxford undergraduates favored these demanding and time- intensive tutorials. Implications: Attending physicians who adopt a tutorial-based approach toward their students’ notes would have a forum to teach clinical reasoning and emphasize the importance of written composition in medical practice. © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954474495"

Historically, students on our Internal Medicine clerkship were given a written reflection assignment without explanation of critical reflection. To facilitate the development of deeper reflection, a new curriculum was introduced. Intervention: A 90-minute workshop on critical reflection was introduced at the start of the Internal Medicine rotation. Key components included a video clip stimulating reflection, small- and large-group exercises, and a faculty member’s personal reflection. Students were then asked to write two reflection papers. To minimize bias, the names and dates were removed from each reflection paper and combined with reflection papers from a historical control group. Four faculty used a previously validated tool, the REFLECT rubric, to independently grade the written reflection papers as nonreflective (as a 1), thoughtful action (2), reflection (3), or critical reflection (4). The final grade of each paper was determined by consensus among the graders. Context: The 90-minute workshop was given once at the beginning of each 10-week requisite Internal Medicine clerkship to 3rd-year medical students. Outcome: One hundred fifty-five papers written after the workshop were compared to 155 papers from a preworkshop historical control group. The primary analysis showed the number of students writing “critical reflection” papers increased after the educational intervention, from 14% to 47% (p D.0002). The effect size using Cohen’s d was 0.62. The kappa statistic used to measure interrater reliability among the four graders was 0.37. Lessons Learned: Through a 90- minute reflection workshop more 3rd-year students were able to demonstrate the potential for “critical reflection” compared to previous students not exposed to this teaching. Strengths include the large sample size of written reflection papers submitted throughout an entire academic year and blinded grading of papers that minimized bias. The low interrater reliability is a limitation. We believe this curriculum could readily be adapted to a clerkship seeking to enhance learner reflection. © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954532181"

Four archetypes (Market, Adhocracy, Clan, Hierarchy) reflecting an organization’s values with respect to focus (internal vs. external) and process (flexibility vs. stability and control) were used to characterize one department’s receptiveness to formative feedback. The prevalence of residents’ identification with certain archetypes served as an indicator of the department’s organizational feedback culture. Background: New regulations have forced academic institutions to implement wide-ranging changes to accommodate competency-based milestones and their assessment. These changes challenge residencies that use formative feedback from faculty as a major source of data for determining training advancement. Though various approaches have been taken to improve formative feedback to residents, there currently exists no tool to objectively measure the organizational culture that surrounds this process. Assessing organizational culture, commonly used in the business sector to represent organizational health, may help residency directors gauge their program’s success in fostering formative feedback. The Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument (OCAI) is widely used, extensively validated, applicable to survey research, and theoretically based and may be modifiable to assess formative feedback culture in the emergency department. Approach: Using a modified Delphi technique and several iterations of focus groups amongst educators at one institution, four of the original six OCAI domains (which each contain 4 possible responses) were modified to create a 16-item Formative Feedback Culture Tool (FFCT) that was administered to 26 residents (response rate D 55%) at a single academic emergency medicine department. The mean score of each item on the FFCT (range D 0-100) was analyzed. Convergent and divergent properties of the four archetypes were assessed using a multitrait-multimethod matrix of Pearson’s coefficients. Expecting that items in one archetype would diverge from the others, whereas items within an archetype should have strong convergent properties, convergent validity was assessed by comparing items across domains that all related to the same archetype. Similarly, divergent validity was assessed by comparing the correlation of items within an archetype to the correlations of those items within a hetero-domain block (i.e., to other items within the same domain). Results: Three of the four domains of the FFCT (Overall Departmental Characteristics 35.4 § 15.4, Departmental Foundation of Feedback 46.1 § 16.7, and Departmental Emphasis of Feedback 30.3 § 17.7) had the highest mean in the Market archetype (results/achievement oriented), whereas the final domain (Departmental Definition of Successful Feedback 34.8 § 22.1) had the highest mean in the Clan archetype (personal growth/team achievement). Item responses in the Clan and Hierarchy archetypes had the strongest convergent and divergent validity, respectively. Item responses in the Adhocracy archetype had the weakest convergent and divergent validity. Conclusions: Although the sample size was small, this initial study demonstrates that a modified organizational culture assessment tool can feasibly be utilized to identify the primary formative feedback archetype of a cohort of residents. This may have future implications for measuring changes in culture after the implementation of strategic programs to address formative the FFCT to other institutions, as well as address the weak feedback. Future studies should examine the generalizability of validity evidence of the Adhocracy archetype in the FFCT. © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954516930"

Yet heterogeneity among service-learning programs suggests the need for a framework to understand variations among service-learning programs in medical education. Approach: A qualitative systematic review of literature on service-learning and medical education was conducted for the period between 1998 and 2012. A two-stage inclusion criteria process resulted in articles (n = 32) on service-learning and Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine being included for both coding and analysis. Focused and selective coding were employed to identify recurring themes and subthemes from the literature. Findings: The findings of the qualitative thematic analysis of service-learning variation in medical education identified a total of seven themes with subthemes. The themes identified from the analysis were (a) geographic location and setting, (b) program design, (c) funding, (d) participation, (e) program implementation, (f) assessment, and (g) student outcomes. Insights: This systematic review of literature confirmed the existence of program heterogeneity among service-learning program in medical education. However, the findings of this study provide key insights into the nature of service-learning in medical education building a framework for which to organize differences among service-learning programs.

Contemporary students borrow more money and accumulate debt far surpassing that of previous generations of physicians, and both interest rates and terms of loan repayment have changed significantly in the last decade. As a result, the experiences of medical students differ from the experiences of physician educators. Little is known about how contemporary medical students view their debt in the context of career planning. Understanding contemporary U.S. medical students’ lived experiences of educational debt is important, because high debt levels may affect medical students’ well-being and professional development. Approach: The study's purpose was to explore contemporary students’ views of their debt in the context of career planning. In 2012, 2nd-year medical students enrolled in a health policy course at one medical school were invited to write an essay about how debt influences their career choices. The authors analyzed 132 essays using immersion and crystallization and iterative, team-based coding. Code-recode strategies, member checking, and reflexivity ensured validity and rigor. Findings: Three themes emerged about the meaning of debt: debt symbolizes lack of social investment, debt reinforces a sense of entitlement, and debt is a collective experience. Four approaches to debt management emerged: anticipation, avoidance, acceptance, and disempowerment. Insights: Medical students’ views of debt are more complex than previously reported. Medical educators should recognize that many students experience debt as a stressor, acknowledge students’ emotions about debt, and invite discussion about the culture of entitlement in medical education and how this culture affects students’ professionalism. At the same time, educators should emphasize that students have many repayment options and that regardless of specialty choice, most physicians repay their debts without significant difficulty. Further exploration is needed of the relationships between the amount of debt owed, students’ attitudes toward their debt, and other student characteristics. Because students experience debt in a range of ways, more nuanced approaches to understanding and reframing student perceptions of debt are necessary. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84965010171"

Background: Multiple tools exist to evaluate procedural skills, each with specific weaknesses. Approach: We sought to determine if quantitative needle tracking could be used as a measure of lumbar puncture (LP) performance and added discriminatory value to a dichotomous checklist. Thirty-two medical students were divided into 2 groups. One group was asked to practice an LP once (single practice [SP]) and the other 5 times (multiple practice [MP]). Experts (attending ER physicians, senior ER residents, and a junior anesthesia resident) were used as comparators. Medical students were assessed again at 1 month to assess skill retention. Groups were assessed performing an LP with an electromagnetic tracking device that allows the needle's 3-dimensional movements to be captured and analyzed, and a dichotomous checklist. Results: Quantitative needle metrics as assessed by electromagnetic tracking showed a decreasing trend in needle movement distance with practice and with experience. The SP group made significantly more checklist mistakes initially as compared to the MP group (1.2 vs. 0.3, p <.05). At 1 month, there was a significant increase in both groups' mistakes (SP 3.4 vs. MP 1.3, p =.01). No correlation existed between individuals' needle motion and checklist mistakes. Conclusions: These findings suggest that quantitative needle tracking identifies students who struggle with needle insertion but are successful at completing the dichotomous checklist. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921288887"

Intervention: We reviewed the published literature regarding Year 4 concerns as well as institutional efforts to improve the 4th-year curriculum from several schools. Based on input from key stakeholders, we established 4 goals for our Year 4 curriculum reform: (a) standardize the curricular structure, (b) allow flexibility and individualization, (c) improve the preparation for residency, and (d) improve student satisfaction. After the reform, we evaluated the outcomes using results from the Association of American Medical Colleges Questionnaire, student focus groups, and program director surveys. Context: This article describes the context, process, and outcomes of the reform of the Year 4 curriculum at Stony Brook University School of Medicine. Outcome: We were able to achieve all four stated goals for the reform. The significant components of the change included a flexible adaptable curriculum based on individual needs and preferences, standardized learning objectives across the year, standardized competency-based evaluations regardless of discipline, reinforcement of clinical skills, and training for the transition to the workplace as an intern. The reform resulted in increased student satisfaction, increased elective time, and increased preparedness for residency training as perceived by the graduates. The Program Director survey showed significant changes in ability to perform a medical history and exam, management of common medical conditions and emergencies, clinical reasoning and problem-solving skills, working and communication with the healthcare team, and overall professionalism in meeting obligations inherent in the practice of medicine. Lessons Learned: Lessons learned from our 4th-year reform process are discussed. Listening to the needs of the stakeholders was an important step in ensuring buy-in, having an institutional champion with an organizational perspective on the overall institutional mission was helpful in building the guiding coalition for change, building highly interactive collaborative interdisciplinary teams to work together addressed departmental silos and tunnel vision early on, and planning a curriculum is exciting but planning the details of the implementation can be quite tedious. © 2016, © Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963682874"

Few available studies have examined the effects of low response rates on the reliability and precision of the evaluation measure. Moreover, the minimum number of raters to target when response rates are low remains unclear. Approach: Descriptive data were derived from 799 students’ paper and online ratings of 11 preclinical instructional units (PIUs). Reliability was assessed by Cronbach’s alpha coefficients. The generalizability method applying the symmetry principle approach was used to analyze the precision of the measure with a reference standard error of mean (SEM) set at 0.10; optimization models were built to estimate minimum response rates. Results: Overall, response rates were 74% and 30% (p <.001) and PIUs ratings were 3.8 § 0.5 and 3.6 § 0.5 (p D.02), respectively in paper and online questionnaires. Higher SEM levels and significantly larger 95% confidence intervals of PIUs rating scores were observed with online evaluations. To keep the SEM within preset limits of precision, a minimum of 48% response rate was estimated for online formats.

Allopathic medical students' vocational identity may bear a relationship to the level of emphasis placed on research versus service at their medical school. Approach: Social mission score (SMS) and the US News and World Report (USNWR) research ranking (year 2011) were used as schools' national rankings for service and research, respectively. A questionnaire was sent to 960 3rd-year medical students from 24 allopathic medical schools between January and April 2011. The scale for vocational identity was created using the responses from the Vocational Identity Scale (9 items), and we used an established cutoff from a previous study to categorize those students who had “strong” vocational identity. Findings: After categorizing allopathic medical schools into four groups based on SMS rankings, we found that medical students who attended allopathic medical schools from the two highest SMS ranking groups were more likely to report scores reflecting strong vocational identities—odds ratio [OR] = 2.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.8, 4.7] and OR = 2.5, 95% CI [1.6, 4.0], respectively. In contrast, we did not find any associations between students from allopathic medical schools with high USNWR rankings and likelihood of reporting scores reflecting strong vocational identities. Insights: Social mission scores for allopathic medical schools may potentially serve as predictors of professional and vocational identity development. Further research is needed to better understand these findings, as this is one of the first studies both to examine allopathic medical students' sense of vocational identity and to explore the use of SMS rankings as predictors of medical students' professional development. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928565599"

Current university and hospital policies concerning the use of devices may be incongruent with day-to-day patient care. Purpose: The goal was to assess the current usage patterns of the Internet, e-mail, and personal electronics for clinical purposes by surgical residents as well as their communication habits and preferences. Also assessed was residents’ knowledge regarding the institutional policies surrounding these issues. Methods: Surgical residents (n = 294) at a large teaching institution were surveyed regarding their knowledge of university policies as well as daily use of various communication technologies. Communication preferences were determined using theoretical clinical scenarios. Results: Our survey with a response rate of 54.7% (n = 161) revealed that 93.8% of participants indicated daily Internet use for clinical duties. Most respondents (72%) were either completely unaware of the existence of guidelines for its use or aware but had no familiarity with their content. Use of e-mail for clinical duties was common (85%), and 74% of the respondents rated e-mail as “very important” or “extremely important” for patient care. Everyone who responded had a mobile phone with 98.7% being “smartphones,” which the majority (82.9%) stated was “very important” or “extremely important” for patient care. Text messaging was the primary communication method for 57.8% of respondents. The traditional paging system was the primary communication method for only 1.3% of respondents and the preferred method for none. Conclusions: Daily use of technology is the norm among residents; however, knowledge of university guidelines was exceedingly low. Residents need better education regarding current guidelines. Current guidelines do not reflect current clinical practice. Hospitals should consider abandoning the traditional paging system and consider facilitating better use of residents’ mobile phones. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928548617"

Researchers have yet to elucidate exactly which underlying constructs are measured by the many learning styles questionnaires available. Some academics question whether learning styles exist at all. When it comes to establishing the value of learning styles for medical students, a further issue emerges. The demographics of medical students in the United Kingdom have changed in recent years, so past studies may not be applicable to students today. We wanted to answer a very simple, practical question: what can the literature on learning styles tell us that we can use to help today's medical students succeed academically at medical school? Approach: We conducted a literature review to synthesise the available evidence on how two different aspects of learning—the way in which students like to receive information in a learning environment (termed learning “styles”) and the motivations that drive their learning (termed learning “approaches”)—can impact on medical students' academic achievement. Findings: Our review confirms that although learning “styles” do not correlate with exam performance, learning “approaches” do: those with “strategic” and “deep” approaches to learning (i.e., motivated to do well and motivated to learn deeply respectively) perform consistently better in medical school examinations. Changes in medical school entrant demographics in the past decade have not altered these correlations. Optimistically, our review reveals that students' learning approaches can change and more adaptive approaches may be learned. Insights: For educators wishing to help medical students succeed academically, current evidence demonstrates that helping students develop their own positive learning approach using “growth mind-set” is a more effective (and more feasible) than attempting to alter students' learning styles. This conclusion holds true for both “traditional” and graduate-entry medical students.

Junior faculty face competing demands for clinical productivity, teaching, research, and work–life integration, which can undermine confidence in the value of an academic career. Mentorship is important to foster career development and satisfaction in junior faculty. Intervention: The goals of this academic pediatrics department were to develop, implement, and evaluate a multifaceted pediatric mentoring program to promote retention and satisfaction of junior faculty. Program elements included one-on-one mentor–mentee meetings, didactic workshops, grant review assistance, and facilitated peer-group mentoring. Program effectiveness was assessed using annual surveys of mentees and structured mentee exit interviews, as well as retention data for assistant professors. Context: The mentees were instructors and assistant professors in the department of pediatrics. Outcome: Seventy-nine mentees participated in the program from 2007 through 2014. The response rate from seven annual surveys was 84%. Sixty-nine percent of mentees felt more prepared to advance their careers, 81% had a better understanding of the criteria for advancement, 84% were satisfied with the program, and 95% found mentors accessible. Mentees who exited the program reported they most valued the one-on-one mentoring and viewed the experience positively regardless of promotion. Retention of assistant professors improved after initiation of the program; four of 13 hired from 2002 to 2006 left the institution, whereas 18 of 18 hired from 2007 to 2014 were retained. Lessons Learned: This multifaceted mentoring program appeared to bolster satisfaction and enhance retention of junior pediatric faculty. Mentees reported increased understanding of the criteria for promotion and viewed the program as a positive experience regardless of career path. Individual mentor–mentee meetings were needed at least twice yearly to establish the mentoring relationship. Identifying “next steps” at the end of individual meetings was helpful to hold both parties accountable for progress. Mentees most valued workshops fostering development of tangible skills (such as scientific writing) and those clarifying the criteria for promotion more transparent. Facilitated peer-group mentoring for mentees at the instructor rank provided valuable peer support. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964007981"

Background: To solve clinical problems, clinicians must gain a clear representation of the issues. In the clinical setting, oral case presentations—or summaries—are used to assess learners' ability to gather, synthesize, and “translate” pertinent case information. This ability can be assessed in Objective Structured Clinical Examination and Virtual Patient settings using oral or written case summaries. Evidence of their validity in these settings includes adequate interrater agreement and moderate correlation with other assessments of clinical reasoning. We examined the use of written case summaries in a classroom setting as part of an examination designed to assess clinical reasoning. Approach: We developed and implemented written examinations for 2 preclerkship general practice courses in Years 4 and 5 of a 7-year curriculum. Examinations included 8 case summary questions in Year 4 and 5 in Year 5. Seven hundred students participated. Cases were scored using 3 criteria: extraction of pertinent findings, semantic quality, and global ratings. We examined the item parameters (using classical test theory) and generalizability of case summary items. We computed correlations between case summary scores and scores on other questions within the examination. Results: Item parameters were acceptable (average item difficulty = 0.49–0.73 and 0.59–0.68 in Years 4 and 5; average point-biserials = 0.21–0.24 and 0.18–0.21). Scores were moderately generalizable (G coefficients = 0.40–0.50), with case-specificity a substantial source of measurement error (10.2%–19.5% of variance). Scoring and rater had small effects. Correlations with related constructs were low to moderate. Conclusions: There is good evidence regarding the scoring and generalizability of written case summaries for assessment of clinical problem representation. Further evidence regarding the extrapolation and implications of these assessments is warranted. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84974698808"

Intervention: We present the evaluation of a novel national surgical workshop that consisted of high-fidelity simulations, lectures, case demonstrations, case discussions, and a basic surgical skills tutorial. The high-fidelity simulations re-created genuine patient encounters and were used to facilitate the acquisition of knowledge and skill in the early recognition and management of acutely unwell surgical patients. Context: The optional workshop was designed for senior medical students and delivered by surgical trainees. Students were asked to complete a 12-item evaluation questionnaire and a 26-item multiple-choice question (MCQ) quiz, which assessed their confidence; self-perceived competence; and knowledge prior to, immediately following, and 8 weeks after the workshop. Pre- and postdata were compared using student's two-tailed t test. Outcome: A total of 66 medical students from 6 UK universities attended, the majority of whom enjoyed the workshop (98.3%, n = 59). Participants' confidence rating (scale = 1–5) in assessing an unwell surgical patient improved from a mean of 2.5 (n = 47) to 4.4 (n = 60). Confidence in commencing initial management improved from a mean of 2.7 (n = 47) to 4.1 (n = 59). Confidence and self-perceived competence across 12 domains improved significantly following the workshop, two-tailed unpaired t test, t(22) = 8.64, p <.0001, d = 3.68. MCQ scores immediately following the workshop were a statistically significant improvement on the preworkshop MCQ scores (n = 44), paired two-tailed t test, t(43) = 7.76, p <.0001, d = 2.37, and the improvement was sustained 8 weeks following the workshop (n = 18), paired two-tailed t test, t(17) = 3.34, p =.0039, d = 1.62. Lessons Learned: Feedback from students was very positive and clearly demonstrated that a workshop taught by surgical trainees improved medical students’ confidence, self-perceived competence, and knowledge in the assessment and management of acutely unwell surgical patients. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921297477"

Given that homeless individuals have high rates of mortality and morbidity, are more likely to be users of the healthcare system, and often report unmet health needs, it is important to examine how homelessness is addressed in medical education. We wanted to examine content and framing of issues related to homelessness in the case-based learning (CBL) curriculum and provide insights about whether medical students are being adequately trained to meet the health needs of homeless individuals through CBL. Approach: CBL content at a Canadian medical school that featured content related to homelessness was analyzed. Data were extracted from cases for the following variables: curriculum unit (e.g., professionalism/ethics curriculum or biomedical/clinical curriculum), patient characteristics (e.g., age, sex), and medical and social conditions. A thematic analysis was performed on cases related to homelessness. Discrepancies in analysis were resolved by consensus. Findings: Homelessness was mentioned in five (2.6%) of 191 CBL cases in the medical curriculum. Homelessness was significantly more likely to be featured in professionalism/ethics cases than in biomedical/clinical cases (p =.03). Homeless patients were portrayed as socially disadvantaged individuals, and medical learners were prompted to discuss ethical issues related to homeless patients in cases. However, homeless individuals were largely voiceless in cases. Homelessness was associated with serious physical and mental health concerns, but students were rarely prompted to address these concerns. Insights: The health and social needs of homeless individuals are often overlooked in CBL cases in the medical curriculum. Moreover, stereotypes of homelessness may be reinforced through medical training. There are opportunities for growth in addressing the needs of homeless individuals through medical education. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954481873"

Background: Competency-based medical education has mandated a shift to learner-centeredness, authentic observation, and frequent formative assessments with a focus on the delivery of effective feedback. Because feedback has been shown to be of variable quality and effectiveness, an assessment of feedback quality in the workplace is important to ensure we are providing trainees with optimal learning opportunities. The purposes of this project were to develop a rating scale for the quality of verbal feedback in the workplace (the Direct Observation of Clinical Skills Feedback Scale [DOCS-FBS]) and to gather validity evidence for its use. Approach: Two panels of experts (local and national) took part in a nominal group technique to identify features of high-quality feedback. Through multiple iterations and review, 9 features were developed into the DOCS-FBS. Four rater types (residents n = 21, medical students n = 8, faculty n = 12, and educators n = 12) used the DOCS-FBS to rate videotaped feedback encounters of variable quality. The psychometric properties of the scale were determined using a generalizability analysis. Participants also completed a survey to gather data on a 5-point Likert scale to inform the ease of use, clarity, knowledge acquisition, and acceptability of the scale. Results: Mean video ratings ranged from 1.38 to 2.96 out of 3 and followed the intended pattern suggesting that the tool allowed raters to distinguish between examples of higher and lower quality feedback. There were no significant differences between rater type (range = 2.36–2.49), suggesting that all groups of raters used the tool in the same way. The generalizability coefficients for the scale ranged from 0.97 to 0.99. Item-total correlations were all above 0.80, suggesting some redundancy in items. Participants found the scale easy to use (M = 4.31/5) and clear (M = 4.23/5), and most would recommend its use (M = 4.15/5). Use of DOCS-FBS was acceptable to both trainees (M = 4.34/5) and supervisors (M = 4.22/5). Conclusions: The DOCS-FBS can reliably differentiate between feedback encounters of higher and lower quality. The scale has been shown to have excellent internal consistency.

Prior cross-sectional studies highlight performance evaluation differences between introverted and extraverted medical students, though the mechanisms and implications of these differences remain relatively unexplained and understudied. This gap in the literature has become more salient as medical schools are employing more interactive learning strategies into their curricula which may disproportionately challenge introverted learners. Evidence: In this article, we provide an overview and working definition of introversion as a valid construct occurring on a continuum. We apply a goodness of fit model to explore how various medical training contexts may be more or less challenging for introverted students and the potential consequences of a poor fit. As preliminary support for these hypothesized challenges, we share observations from students self-identified as introverts. Examples include introverted students feeling at times like misfits, questioning a need to change their identity to succeed in medical school, and being judged as underperformers. We offer pragmatic suggestions for improving the fit between introverted students and their training contexts, such as teachers and students pausing between a question being asked and the initial response being offered and teachers differentiating between anxious and introverted behaviors. We conclude with suggested areas for future qualitative and quantitative research to examine how medical school curricula and the teaching environment may be differentially impacting the learning and health of introverted and extraverted students. Implications: Extraverted behaviors will continue to be an important part of medical training and practice, but the merits of introverted behaviors warrant further consideration as both medical training and practice evolve. Educators who make manageable adjustments to current teaching practices can improve the learning for both introverted and extraverted styles of academic engagement. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921319074"

Approach: The purpose of this study is to describe pediatric residents’ experiences and perspectives on the current and ideal states of MH training and ideas for curriculum development to bridge this gap. A qualitative study using focus groups of pediatric residents from an urban academic medical center was performed. Audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Findings: Twenty-six residents participated in three focus groups, which is when thematic saturation was achieved. The team generated five major themes: capabilities, comfort, organizational capacity, coping, and education. Residents expressed uncertainty at every step of an MH visit. Internal barriers identified included low levels of comfort and negative emotional responses. External barriers included a lack of MH resources and mentorship in MH care, or an inadequate organizational capacity. These internal and external barriers resulted in a lack of perceived capability in handling MH issues. In response, residents reported inadequate coping strategies, such as ignoring MH concerns. To build knowledge and skills, residents prefer educational modalities including didactics, experiential learning through collaborations with MH specialists, and tools built into patient care flow. Insights: Pediatric residency programs need to evolve in order to improve resident training in MH care. The skills and knowledge requested by residents parallel the American Academy of Pediatrics statement on MH competencies. Models of collaborative care provide similar modalities of learning requested by residents. These national efforts have not been operationalized in training programs yet may be useful for curriculum development and dissemination to enhance trainees’ MH knowledge and skills to provide optimal MH care for children. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928570379"

Our own prior attempts at developing and implementing an effective journal club required improvements. Intervention: Our intervention consisted of an innovative, effective journal club model that has more well-defined elements that are readily adaptable for other residency programs. The collective strategies were based on the previous literature and our own experiences. Context: Our intervention was implemented in a department of psychiatry within a university-based medical school. Study participants came from a psychiatry department's residency programs (N = 36) during academic year 2011–2012 with senior residents having the option to attend journal club. Using a multifaceted approach, measures included attendance, presession quizzes, postsession evaluations, and a final postcourse evaluation of 11 dimensions (e.g., goals, objectives). Outcome: Thirty-one (86%) trainees attended journal club—a substantial increase from previous years. The presession-quiz median was 4.4 total correct out of 6 questions (range = 3.3–5.3), indicating that the articles were generally read before the session. The postsession-evaluation median was 4.6 (1–5 scale, 5 the highest; range = 4.1–4.8), indicating sessions were well received. The final postcourse-evaluation overall mean was 3.9 (1–5 scale, 5 the highest; subscale M range = 3.4–4.5). Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the postcourse evaluation indicated the following positive aspects: educational objectives generally met, overall structured format, quality of discussions, individuals involved (e.g., course directors, trainees, faculty facilitators), and availability of food. Areas of possible improvement included time management within the sessions, more contemporary and clinically relevant articles, consistency in faculty moderators, and evaluation process. Engagement in learning appeared to have been dramatically increased through five strategies: (a) meaningful incentives; (b) assigned, engaged consistently prepared faculty; (c) meaningful evaluation; (d) prejournal club preparations that helped residents assimilate critical appraisal with time-and-task-management skills; and (e) a planning group that developed and improved curricula and instruction to meet the objectives of the course. Lessons Learned: Overall, effective, and successful journal clubs require systematic planning, implementation, modification, and refinement.

Medical students' level of preparedness and comfort caring for LGBT patients is unknown. Approach: An online questionnaire (2009–2010) was distributed to students (n = 9,522) at 176 allopathic and osteopathic medical schools in Canada and the United States, followed by focus groups (2010) with students (n = 35) at five medical schools. The objective of this study was to characterize LGBT-related medical curricula, to determine medical students' assessments of their institutions' LGBT-related curricular content, and to evaluate their comfort and preparedness in caring for LGBT patients. Findings: Of 9,522 survey respondents, 4,262 from 170 schools were included in the final analysis. Most medical students (2,866/4,262; 67.3%) evaluated their LGBT-related curriculum as “fair” or worse. Students most often felt prepared addressing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; 3,254/4,147; 78.5%) and non-HIV sexually transmitted infections (2,851/4,136; 68.9%). They felt least prepared discussing sex reassignment surgery (1,061/4,070; 26.1%) and gender transitioning (1,141/4,068; 28.0%). Medical education helped 62.6% (2,669/4,262) of students feel “more prepared” and 46.3% (1,972/4,262) of students feel “more comfortable” to care for LGBT patients. Four focus group sessions with 29 students were transcribed and analyzed. Qualitative analysis suggested students have significant concerns in addressing certain aspects of LGBT health, specifically with transgender patients. Insights: Medical students thought LGBT-specific curricula could be improved, consistent with the findings from a survey of deans of medical education. They felt comfortable, but not fully prepared, to care for LGBT patients. Increasing curricular coverage of LGBT-related topics is indicated with emphasis on exposing students to LGBT patients in clinical settings.

Intervention: An online learning community for enhanced training in Motivational Interviewing was developed for 3rd-year medical students. The website included educational materials about Motivational Interviewing as well as problematic health behaviors, a repository of exemplar videos and student videos with feedback, and a discussion board. Student participants were given the opportunity to record an encounter with a patient and to receive feedback on their use of Motivational Interviewing from a faculty member. Context: Student volunteers in the Family Medicine Clerkship at Georgetown University School of Medicine were randomized to enhanced training, which included the online learning community, or training as usual. All student volunteers completed a questionnaire assessing self-efficacy initially and at the end of the clerkship. Students also participated in an Observed Structured Clinical Exam, which was subsequently coded by a blinded rater for behavioral counts of Motivational Interviewing techniques, key steps in Motivational Interviewing, and overall Motivational Interviewing style. Outcome: Students in the enhanced training arm were rated as having significantly higher scores in Motivational Interviewing style in the Observed Structured Clinical Exam than training as usual students. A significant increase in self-efficacy from pre- to posttest in the overall sample was observed but between-group differences were not significant. Student feedback was particularly positive regarding video recorded practice sessions with patients and individualized feedback. Lessons Learned: The results of this study as well as student feedback suggest that future work should include patient practice sessions and individualized feedback in developing Motivational Interviewing curricula. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921280807"

Background: Assessing medical students' advanced communication skills, particularly in the context of providing tobacco-dependence treatment, consistently and accurately is challenging; doing so across multiple medical schools is even more difficult. Approach: Ten medical schools implemented a tobacco-dependence treatment case as part of an Objective Structured Clinical Examination for 3rd-year medical students. A 33-item checklist with detailed criteria and examples was developed for scoring students' performances. Trained coders viewed and coded 660 videotaped encounters; approximately 10% also were coded by the coding supervisor to check accuracy. Results: Average time required to code an encounter was approximately 31 minutes; accuracy (i.e., agreement with the gold standard coder) was excellent. Overall, students performed an average of 1 in 4 of the 33 behaviors included on the checklist, and only 1 in 10 discussed setting a quit date. Most students (almost 9 in 10) asked how much the patient smoked in a day, and just over 7 in 10 informed the patient that the cough was due to smoking. Conclusions: The authors developed and implemented a rigorous assessment that will be used to evaluate medical students' tobacco-dependence treatment skills. Operationalizing the specific counseling behaviors, training coders to accurately capture students' performances using a structured checklist, and conducting the coding all required substantial time commitments but will provide confidence in the objectivity of the assessment results. In addition, this assessment can be used to provide formative information on medical students' tobacco-dependence treatment skills and to tailor ongoing training for medical students in this area.

Based on social identity theory, physicians likely differentiate between feedback from members of their own profession and others. The current study examined residents' experiences with, and perceptions of, interprofessional feedback. Approach: In 2013, Anesthesia, Obstetrics-Gynecology, Pediatrics, and Psychiatry residents completed a survey including questions about frequency of feedback from different professionals and its perceived value (5-point scale). The authors performed an analysis of variance to examine interactions between residency program and profession of feedback provider. They conducted follow-up interviews with a subset of residents to explore reasons for residents' survey ratings. Findings: Fifty-two percent (131/254) of residents completed the survey, and 15 participated in interviews. Eighty percent of residents reported receiving written feedback from physicians, 26% from nurses, and less than 10% from other professions. There was a significant interaction between residency program and feedback provider profession, F(21, 847) = 3.82, p <.001, and a significant main effect of feedback provider profession, F(7, 847) = 73.7, p <.001. On post hoc analyses, residents from all programs valued feedback from attending physicians higher than feedback from others, and anesthesia residents rated feedback from other professionals significantly lower than other residents. Ten major themes arose from qualitative data analysis, which revealed an overall positive attitude toward interprofessional feedback and clarified reasons behind residents' perceptions and identified barriers. Insights: Residents in our study reported limited exposure to interprofessional feedback and valued such feedback less than intraprofessional feedback. However, our data suggest opportunities exist for effective utilization of interprofessional feedback. © 2016, © Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963635512"

Many institutions have developed guidelines on using SNS, but they are insufficient for students. Educators need new methods to train students on the appropriate use of this technology, but more information is needed before implementing change. Purposes: Differences in SNS usage between students and faculty were examined. The goal was to evaluate four content areas: SNS usage patterns, attitudes regarding activity on SNS, experience with patient interactions online, and awareness of institutional guidelines on use of SNS. Methods: A cross-sectional survey took place at Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, in 2012. Participants included all students and a cohort of faculty who teach them in a class on professionalism. Results: The response rate was 42% by students (300/711) and 78% by faculty (31/40). Of the students, 94% use SNS, compared to 48% of faculty. Students were more likely than faculty to display content they would not want patients to see (57% vs. 27%), report seeing inappropriate content on colleagues’ SNS profiles (64% vs. 42%), and ignore harmful postings by colleagues (25% vs. 7%). Faculty were more likely than students to have been approached by patients on SNS (53% vs. 3%). Most participants were unlikely to conduct Internet searches on patients. Conclusions: Students are more likely than faculty to use SNS and use it very differently than faculty. Students would benefit from training on appropriate use of SNS. Topics that should be addressed include editing one's online presence, managing friend requests from patients, dealing with colleagues who post harmful content, conducting Internet searches on patients, and discussion of boundaries to identify potential harms associated with SNS usage. Differences in usage between students and faculty raise questions if faculty are well suited to provide this training. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928521431"

The effect of DHR on medical student educational experiences is unknown. We examined medical students’ and clerkship directors’ perceptions of the effects of the 2011 DHR on internal medicine clerkship students’ experiences with teaching, feedback and evaluation, and patient care. Approach: Students at 14 institutions responded to surveys after their medicine clerkship or subinternship. Students who completed their clerkship (n = 839) and subinternship (n = 228) March to June 2011 (pre-DHR historical controls) were compared to clerkship students (n = 895) and subinterns (n = 377) completing these rotations March to June 2012 (post-DHR). Z tests for proportions correcting for multiple comparisons were performed to assess attitude changes. The Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine annual survey queried institutional members about the 2011 DHR just after implementation. Findings: Survey response rates were 64% and 50% for clerkship students and 60% and 48% for subinterns in 2011 and 2012 respectively, and 82% (99/121) for clerkship directors. Post-DHR, more clerkship students agreed that attendings (p =.011) and interns (p =.044) provided effective teaching. Clerkship students (p =.013) and subinterns (p =.001) believed patient care became more fragmented. The percentage of holdover patients clerkship students (p =.001) and subinterns (p =.012) admitted increased. Clerkship directors perceived negative effects of DHR for students on all survey items. Most disagreed that interns (63.1%), residents (67.8%), or attendings (71.1%) had more time to teach. Most disagreed that students received more feedback from interns (56.0%) or residents (58.2%). Fifty-nine percent felt that students participated in more patient handoffs. Insights: Students perceive few adverse consequences of the 2011 DHR on their internal medicine experiences, whereas their clerkship director educators have negative perceptions. Future research should explore the impact of fragmented patient care on the student–patient relationship and students’ clinical skills acquisition. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921272362"

CDIM members move medical education forward by sharing innovations in curriculum and assessment and discoveries related to educating our students and administering our programs. The Alliance for Academic Internal Medicine, of which CDIM is a founding member, broadens the umbrella beyond student education to include five academically focused specialty organizations representing departments of medicine, teaching hospitals, and medical schools working together to advance learning, discovery, and caring. CDIM held its 2015 annual meeting at Academic Internal Medicine Week in Atlanta, Georgia. This year 36 innovation and research submissions were selected for either oral abstract or poster presentation. The quality of the presentations was outstanding this year and included many of the most important issues in medical education. The CDIM research committee selected the following seven abstracts as being of the highest quality, the most generalizable, and relevant to the readership of Teaching and Learning in Medicine. Two abstracts include information from the CDIM annual survey, which remains a rich source for answering questions about student education on a national level. Looking at trends in medical education, three of the seven selected abstracts mention entrustable professional activities. Three of the abstracts address how we assess student skill and provide them with appropriate feedback. These include two schools' approach to bringing milestones into the medical student realm, use of objective structured clinical exam for assessing clinical skill in clerkship, and what students want in terms of feedback. Four articles deal with curricular innovation. These include interprofessional education, high-value care, transitions of care, and internship preparation. We are pleased to share these abstracts, which represent the breadth and quality of thought of our CDIM members. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84976902127"

Background: Healthcare team function has a direct impact on patient safety and quality of care. However, IPE team training has not been the norm. collaborative care, our College of Nursing implemented an IPE simulation activity called Disaster Day and invited other professions to participate. The exercise consists of two sessions: one in the morning and another in the afternoon. The disaster scenario is announced just prior to each session, which consists of team building, a 90-minute simulation, and debriefing. Approximately 300 Nursing, Medicine, Pharmacy, Emergency Medical Technicians, and Radiology students and over 500 standardized and volunteer patients participated in the Disaster Day event. To improve student learning outcomes, we created 3 competency-based instruments to evaluate collaborative practice in multidimensional fashion during this exercise. Approach: A 20-item IPE Team Observation Instrument designed to assess interprofessional team’s attainment of Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC) competencies was completed by 20 faculty and staff observing the Disaster Day simulation. One hundred sixty-six standardized patients completed a 10-item Standardized Patient IPE Team Evaluation Instrument developed from the IPEC competencies and adapted items from the 2014 Henry et al. PIVOT Questionnaire. This instrument assessed the standardized or volunteer patient’s perception of the team’s collaborative performance. A 29-item IPE Team’s Perception of Collaborative Care Questionnaire, also created from the IPEC competencies and divided into 5 categories of Values/Ethics, Roles and Responsibilities, Communication, Teamwork, and Self-Evaluation, was completed by 188 students including 99 from Nursing, 43 from Medicine, 6 from Pharmacy, and 40 participants who belonged to more than one component, were students at another institution, or did not indicate their institution. The team instrument was designed to assess each team member’s perception of how well the team and him- or herself met the competencies. Five of the items on the team perceptions questionnaire mirrored items on the standardized patient evaluation: demonstrated leadership practices that led to effective teamwork, discussed care and decisions about that care with patient, described roles and responsibilities clearly, worked well together to coordinate care, and good/effective communication. Results: Internal consistency reliability of the IPE Team Observation Instrument was 0.80. In 18 of the 20 items, more than 50% of observers indicated the item was demonstrated. Of those, 6 of the items were observed by 50% to 75% of the observers, and the remaining 12 were observed by more than 80% of the observers. Internal consistency reliability of the IPE Team’s Perception of Collaborative Care Instrument was 0.95. The mean response score-1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree)—was calculated for each section of the instrument. The overall mean score was 3.57 (SD = .11). Internal consistency reliability of the Standardized Patient IPE Team Evaluation Instrument was 0.87. The overall mean score was 3.28 (SD = .17). The ratings for the 5 items shared by the standardized patient and team perception instruments were compared using independent sample t tests. Statistically significant differences (p <.05) were present in each case, with the students rating themselves higher on average than the standardized patients did (mean differences between 0.2 and 0.6 on a scale of 1-4). Conclusions: Multidimensional, competency-based instruments appear to provide a robust view of IPE teamwork; however, challenges remain. Due to the large scale of the simulation exercise, observation-based assessment did not function as well as self- and standardized patient-based assessment. To promote greater variation in observer assessments during future Disaster Day simulations, we plan to adjust the rating scale from “not observed,” “observed,” and “not applicable” to a 4-point scale and reexamine interrater reliability. © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954505424"

However, social workers may be well placed to teach SBIRT in clinical training settings. Intervention: We describe a curriculum with social workers as SBIRT trainers of emergency medicine (EM) residents during actual clinical shifts in an EM residency training program. The curriculum required 1 EM faculty member working with social workers and 1 additional hour of formal residency conference teaching time. Context: We implemented the curriculum at both a university tertiary care hospital emergency department and a county trauma center. We trained 8 social workers at both sites as SBIRT superusers to teach and assess EM resident SBIRT performance with actual patients. We measured the length and number of sessions to attain SBIRT competence, residents' satisfaction, and resident comments (coded by authors). Outcome: Five of the 8 social workers trained residents between June 2013 and May 2014, 31 EM residents trained to a level indicating SBIRT competence with 114 patients. Each patient interaction averaged 8.8 minutes and residents averaged 3.13 patients. Twenty-four (77%) residents gave ratings of 1.58 (SD =.58) for the quality of teaching, 2.33 (SD =.87) for recommending the training to a colleague, 1.38 (SD =.49) for superusers' knowledge, 1.88 (SD =.95) for usefulness of instruction, 1.54 (SD =.72) for workplace learning, and 1.58 (SD =.78) for valuing learning from social workers (on a scale of 1 [very satisfied/strongly agree] to 5 [very dissatisfied/strongly disagree]). Residents preferred learning SBIRT during the 1st and 2nd training years and in the workplace. Lessons Learned: Social work colleagues can be effective in teaching SBIRT to residents in the workplace, and our residents highly valued learning from social workers, who all had prior training in motivational interviewing. In the implementation of this curriculum, the clinical demands of residents must be taken into account when teaching occurs, and having multiple social worker instructors was instrumental. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84969269128"

SPs are students' closest approximation to real patients. To maximally benefit students' clinical training and evaluation it is important to find ways to give voice to the totality of SPs' perspectives. Background: SPs have been shown to be a reliable and valid means to assess medical students' clinical skills in clinical skills examinations. We noticed, however, that SPs often express “off the record” concerns about students, which they do not include on traditional assessment forms. Approach: To explore these “off the record” concerns, we designed a Concerns item and added it to the traditional assessment form for an end-of-3rd-year clinical skills examination shared by three medical schools. We asked SPs to use this Concerns item to identify students about whom they had any “gut-level” concerns and provided them with a narrative opportunity to explain why. SPs were informed that the purpose of the item was to help students with difficulties and was not part of the student's grade. Results: We analyzed the concerns data using quantitative and qualitative methods. Of 551 students at three schools, 223 (∼40%) had concerns recorded. Seventy students received two or more concerns. Qualitative analysis of SPs' comments revealed 3 major categories of concern: communication and interpersonal skills, history taking, and physical exam. Grouped under each were several subcategories. More than half of the written comments from the SPs related to the communication/interpersonal skills category and included subcategories commonly addressed in communications courses: lack of empathy, good listening skills, and lack of connection to the patient. They also included subcategories that in our experience are less commonly addressed: odd or off-putting mannerisms, lack of confidence, unprofessional behavior, domineering behavior, and biased behavior. Another 47% of concerns identified deficiencies in history taking and physical examination. Of the students with concerns noted by two or more SPs, SPs' narrative comments on 84%, 42%, and 48% of the students in the domains of communications, history, and physical exam respectively indicated potential problems not identified by scores on the traditional assessment form. Conclusion: The Concerns item is a narrative assessment method that may add value to traditional quantitative scoring by identifying and characterizing problematic student performance not captured by the traditional assessment form.

It answers the question, “Can medical schools increase the admission rates of underrepresented minority (URM) students by balancing cognitive criteria with the experiences, attributes, and metrics of noncognitive data in the admission process?” Background: U.S. demographics are shifting, and by 2042 ethnic minority groups will make up approximately 50% of the population. Increasing diversity of the U.S. population foreshadows the need to increase the number of physicians from underrepresented minorities to help address healthcare disparities that are on the rise. Approach: A cohort of three medical school applicant classes (2007–2009) was used to model the impact on URM admission rates as the relative weights of cognitive and noncognitive admission criteria were varied. This study used the minimum admission standards established for the actual incoming classes. The URM rate of admission to medical school was the outcome. Cognitive criteria included Medical College Admission Test scores and grade point averages. Noncognitive criteria included four categories: background and diversity, interest and suitability for a career in medicine, problem-solving and communication skills, and letters of recommendation. Results: A cohort of 480 applicants from the three applicant classes were enrolled in the study. As the weighting scheme was varied from 50% cognitive/50% noncognitive weights to 35%/65%, the proportion of URM students accepted to medical school increased from 24% (42/177) to 30% (57/193; p <.001). Hispanic and Native American acceptance rates increased by 5.1% and 0.7%, respectively. Conclusions: Admission rates of URM students can be increased by weighting noncognitive higher relative to cognitive criteria without compromising admission standards. Challenging conventional practice in the admissions process may improve health disparities and diversify the physician workforce. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928527412"

Grade inflation continues to exist, and grade distribution is likely to be different among U.S. medical schools. Hypotheses: Increasing the number of available grades curtails “grade inflation.” Method: A national survey of all Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine members was administered in 2011. The authors assessed key aspects of grading. Results: Response rate was 76%. Among clerkship directors (CDs), 61% of respondents agreed that grade inflation existed in the internal medicine clerkship at their school, and 43% believed that it helped students obtain better residency positions. With respect to grading practices, 79% of CDs define specific behaviors needed to achieve each grade, and 36% specify an ideal grade distribution. In addition, 44% have a trained core faculty responsible for evaluating students, 35% describe formal grading meetings, and 39% use the Reporter-Interpreter-Manager-Educator (RIME) scheme. Grading scales were described as follows: 4% utilize a pass/fail system, 13% a 3-tier (e.g., Honors/Pass/Fail), 45% 4-tier, 35% 5-tier, and 4% 6+-tier system. There was a trend to higher grades with more tiers available. Conclusions: Grade inflation continues in the internal medicine clerkship. Almost half of CDs feel that this practice assists students to obtain better residency positions. A minority of programs have a trained core faculty who are responsible for evaluation. About one third have formal grading meetings and use the RIME system; both have been associated with more robust and balanced grading practices. In particular, there is a wide variation between schools in the percentage of students who are awarded the highest grade, which has implications for residency applications. Downstream users of clinical clerkship grades must be fully aware of these variations in grading in order to appropriately judge medical student performance. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84965043725"

Background: “Going paperless” in healthcare has received significant attention over the past decades given the numerous potential benefits of converting to electronic health records. Not surprisingly, medical educators have also considered the potential benefits of electronic assessments for their trainees. What literature exists on the transition from paper-based to electronic-based assessments suggests a positive outcome. In contrast, work done examining the transition to and implementation of electronic health records has noted that hospitals who have implemented these systems have not gone paperless despite the benefits of doing so. Approach: This study sought to transition a paper-based assessment tool, the Ottawa Surgical Competency Operating Room Evaluation (which has strong evidence for validity) to an electronic version, in three surgical specialties (Orthopedic Surgery, Urology, General Surgery). However, as the project progressed, it became necessary to change the focus of the study to explore the issues of transitioning to a paperless assessment tool as we identified an extremely low participation rate. Results: Over the first 3 months 440 assessment cases were logged. However, only a small portion of these cases were assessed using the electronic tool (Orthopedic Surgery = 16%, Urology = 5%, General Surgery = 0%). Participants identified several barriers in using the electronic assessment tool such as increased time compared to the paper version and technological issues related to the log-in procedure. Conclusions: Essentially, users want the tool to be as convenient as paper. This is consistent with research on electronic health records implementation but different from previous work in medical education. Thus, we believe our study highlights an important finding. Transitioning from a paper-based assessment tool to an electronic one is not necessarily a neutral process. Consideration of potential barriers and finding solutions to these barriers will be necessary in order to realize the many benefits of electronic assessments.

The Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) is widely used for assessment and affords an opportunity for both direct observation and feedback to occur simultaneously. For feedback to be effective, it should include direct observation, assessment of performance, provision of feedback, reflection, decision making, and use of feedback for learning and change. Hypotheses: If one of the goals of feedback is to engage students to think about their performance (i.e., reflection), it would seem imperative that they can recall this feedback both immediately and into the future. This study explores recall of feedback in the context of an OSCE. Specifically, the purpose of this study was to (a) determine the amount and the accuracy of feedback that trainees remember immediately after an OSCE, as well as 1 month later, and (b) assess whether prompting immediate recall improved delayed recall. Methods: Internal medicine residents received 2 minutes of verbal feedback from physician examiners in the context of an OSCE. The feedback was audio-recorded and later transcribed. Residents were randomly allocated to the immediate recall group (immediate-RG; n = 10) or the delayed recall group (delayed-RG; n = 8). The immediate-RG completed a questionnaire prompting recall of feedback received immediately after the OSCE, and then again 1 month later. The delayed-RG completed a questionnaire only 1 month after the OSCE. The total number and accuracy of feedback points provided by examiners were compared to the points recalled by residents. Results comparing recall at 1 month between the immediate-RG and the delayed-RG were also studied. Results: Physician examiners provided considerably more feedback points (M = 16.3) than the residents recalled immediately after the OSCE (M = 2.61, p <.001). There was no significant difference between the number of feedback points recalled upon completion of the OSCE (2.61) compared to 1 month later (M = 1.96, p =.06, Cohen's d =.70). Prompting immediate recall did not improve later recall. The mean accuracy score for feedback recall immediately after the OSCE was 4.3/9 or “somewhat representative,” and at 1 month the score dropped to 3.5/9 or “not representative” (ns). Conclusion: Residents recall very few feedback points immediately after the OSCE and 1 month later. The feedback points that are recalled are neither very accurate nor representative of the feedback actually provided. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954560349"

Although much research has examined student perceptions of these innovative teaching pedagogies, there are still questions over which factors influence these views. This article aims to identify these key elements that affect healthcare student satisfaction with PBL and other small-group learning methods, including case-based and team-based learning. Approach: A systematic rapid review method was used to identify high-quality original research papers from the healthcare education literature from between 2009 and 2014. All papers were critically appraised before inclusion in line with published guidelines. Narrative synthesis was achieved using an inductively developed, thematic framework approach. Findings: Fifty-four papers were included in the narrative synthesis. The evidence suggests that, despite an initial period of negative emotion and anxiety, the perspectives of healthcare students toward small-group, active learning methods are generally positive. The key factors influencing this satisfaction level include (a) the facilitator role, (b) tutorial structure, (c) individual student factors, (d) case authenticity, (e) increased feedback, (f) group harmony, and (g) resource availability. Insights: Student satisfaction is an important determinant of healthcare education quality, and the findings of this review may be of value in future curriculum design. The evidence described here suggests that an ideal curriculum may be based on an expert-led, hybrid PBL model. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954542779"

Randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews show that simulation is superior to apprenticeship training. The purpose of this study is to explore, from the perspectives of participants in a simulation-training program, the factors that help or hinder the transfer of skills from simulation to practice. Approach: Purposeful sampling was used to select and study the experience and perspective of novice fellows after they had completed simulation training and then performed ultrasound-guided central venous line in practice. Seven novice pediatric intensive care unit fellows and six supervising faculty in a university-affiliated academic center in a large urban city were recruited between September 2012 and January 2013. We conducted a qualitative study using semistructured interviews as our data source, employing a constructivist, grounded theory methodology. Findings: Both curricular and real-life factors influence the transfer of skills from simulation to practice and the overall performance of trainees. Clear instructions, the opportunity to practice to mastery, one-on-one observation with feedback, supervision, and further real-life experiences were perceived as factors that facilitated the transfer of skills. Concern for patient welfare, live trouble shooting, complexity of the intensive care unit environment, and the procedure itself were perceived as real-life factors that hindered the transfer of skills. Insights: As more studies confirm the superiority of simulation training versus apprenticeship training for initial student learning, the faculty should gain insight into factors that facilitate and hinder the transfer of skills from simulation to bedside settings and impact learners' performances. As simulation further augments clinical learning, efforts should be made to modify the curricular and bedside factors that facilitate transfer of skills from simulation to practice settings. © 2016, © Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963700108"

Background: Since the implementation of the milestones, end-of-rotation evaluations have surfaced as a potentially useful assessment method. However, validity evidence on the use of rotation evaluation scores as part of the NAS has not been studied. This article examines validity evidence for end-of-rotation evaluations that can contribute to developing guidelines that support the NAS. Approach: Data from 2,701 end-of-rotation evaluations measuring 21 out of 22 Internal Medicine milestones for 142 residents were analyzed (July 2013–June 2014). Descriptive statistics were used to measure the distribution of ratings by evaluators (faculty, n = 116; fellows, n = 59; peer-residents, n = 131), by postgraduate years. Generalizability analysis and higher order confirmatory factor analysis were used to examine the internal structure of ratings. Psychometric implications for combining evaluation scores using composite score reliability were examined. Results: Milestone ratings were significantly higher for each subsequent year of training (15/21 milestones). Faculty evaluators had greater variability in ratings across milestones, compared to fellows and residents; faculty ratings were generally correlated with milestone ratings from fellows (r =.45) and residents (r =.25), but lower correlations were found for Professionalism and Interpersonal and Communication Skills. The Φ-coefficient was.71, indicating good reliability. Internal structure supported a 6-factor solution, corresponding to the hierarchical relationship between the milestones and the 6 core competencies. Evaluation scores corresponding to Patient Care, Medical Knowledge, and Practice-Based Learning and Improvement had higher correlations to milestones reported to the ACGME. Mean evaluation ratings predicted problem residents (odds ratio = 5.82, p <.001). Conclusions: Guidelines for rotation evaluations proposed in this study provide useful solutions that can help program directors make decisions on resident progress and contribute to assessment systems in graduate medical education. © 2016, © Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963665119"

However, a significant amount of neurosurgical disease and/or emergencies present in primary care settings or emergency rooms. In light of an already acknowledged shortage of neurosurgery providers, this means that general practitioners should be well educated and prepared to diagnose and manage neurosurgical disease. Considering the devastating consequences of a missed or delayed neurosurgical diagnosis, limiting future physicians’ exposure to the field of neurosurgery is not in the best interests of the patient. Evidence: In this article, the authors review and discuss the results of several studies investigating the prevalence, presentation, diagnosis, and management of neurosurgical disease in emergency and general practice settings. They then discuss the current status of neurosurgical education in medical schools, both from the educators’ and students’ perspectives, and how this status might impact patient care. Finally, they offer suggestions for the improvement of neurosurgical education during medical school. Implications: Despite being considered highly subspecialized, neurosurgical diagnosis and care is a field in which all physicians should receive proper education and training. To properly serve patients and produce competent physicians, steps should be taken to re-emphasize the importance of neurosurgical education for medical students. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928531863"

Exposure to procedural skills involving patients and opportunities to practice under the supervision of doctors are limited. Intervention: A bedside supervision program was piloted at a district general hospital in the United Kingdom. The supervision model was chosen as the method to increase medical students’ practice in basic procedural skills because it allowed safe practice with patients. Context: The program was an optional component of the medical students’ clinical clerkships. Off-duty junior doctors were recruited as voluntary trainers. The trainers obtained requests for procedural tasks from the on-call doctors and ward nurses, following which the trainers supervised medical students performing the basic procedures with patient consent. Outcome: The pilot program was successfully run for 4 weeks. Fourteen students took part, and 9 (64%) completed a postintervention feedback questionnaire. The students’ confidence (rating scale D 1-5) in performing procedural skills improved from a mean of 3.0 (SD § 0.9) to 4.7 (SD § 0.5) following a supervision session. Although the range of skills was limited to opportunistic encounters, the students reported high satisfaction and felt supervision enabled them to identify areas for improvement. Lessons Learned: It is feasible to implement a junior doctor-delivered bedside program to supplement procedural skills training provided by medical schools. The challenges include reconciling the tension between junior doctors’ service work and their teaching commitment, logistical issues such as recruiting a sufficient number of trainers and ensuring adequate coverage of training tasks. © 2015, Crown copyright.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954555798"

However, physician educators who are experts in their given fields may have difficulty conveying their complex thought processes to students. Providing faculty development that equips educators with tools to teach clinical reasoning may support skill development in early medical students. Intervention: We provided faculty development on a modified Bayesian method of teaching clinical reasoning to clinician educators who facilitated small-group, case-based workshops with 2nd-year medical students. We interviewed them before and after the module regarding their perceptions on teaching clinical reasoning. We solicited feedback from the students about the effectiveness of the method in developing their clinical reasoning skills. Context: We carried out this project during an institutional curriculum rebuild where clinical reasoning was a defined goal. At the time of the intervention, there was also increased involvement of the Teaching and Learning Center in elevating the status of teaching and learning. Outcome: There was high overall satisfaction with the faculty development program. Both the faculty and the students described the modified Bayesian approach as effective in fostering the development of clinical reasoning skills. Lessons Learned: Through this work, we learned how to form a beneficial partnership between a clinician educator and Teaching and Learning Center to promote faculty development on a clinical reasoning teaching method for early medical students. We uncovered challenges faced by both faculty and early learners in this study. We observed that our faculty chose to utilize the method of teaching clinical reasoning in a variety of manners in the classroom. Despite obstacles and differing approaches utilized, we believe that this model can be emulated at other institutions to foster the development of clinical reasoning skills in preclerkship students. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84974682760"

Evidence: Mainly national campaigns are aimed at physicians to reconsider their test ordering behaviors, identify overused diagnostics, and disseminate innovative practices. These efforts will fall short if principles of high value care are not incorporated across the spectrum of training for the next generation of physicians. Implications: Consensus findings of an invitational conference of 7 medical school teams consisting of academic leaders included strategies for institutions to meaningfully incorporate high value care into their medical school, residency, and faculty development curricula. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954488406"

Background: Professionalism is an important attribute for physicians and a core competency throughout medical education. Preclinical training often focuses on individual knowledge acquisition with students working only indirectly with faculty assessors. As such, the assessment of professionalism in preclinical training continues to present challenges. We propose a novel approach to preclinical assessment of medical student year medical students completed self- and peer assessments of professionalism in two courses (Pediatrics and Renal/Genitourinary Diseases) following a series of team-based learning exercises. Assessments were composed of nearly identical 9-point rating scales. Correlational analysis and linear regression were used to examine the associations between self- and peer assessments and the effects of predictor variables. Four subgroups were formed based on deviation from the median ratings, and logistic regression was used to assess stability of subgroup membership over time. A missing data analysis was conducted to examine differences between average peer- assessment scores as a function of selective nonparticipation. Results: There was a significant positive correlation (r = .62, p < .0001) between self-assessments completed alone and those completed at the time of peer assessment. There was also a significant positive correlation between average peer-assessment and self-assessment alone (r = .19, p < .0002) and self-assessment at the time of peer assessment (r = .27, p < .0001). Logistic regression revealed that subgroup membership was stable across measurement at two time points (T1 and T2) for all groups, except for members of the high self-assessment/low peer assessment at T1, who were significantly more likely to move to a new group at T2, χ2(3, N = 129) = 7.80, p < .05. Linear regression revealed that self-assessment alone and course were significant predictors of self-assessment at the time of peer assessment (Fself_alone = 144.74, p <.01 and Fcourse = 4.70, p < .05), whereas average peer rating, stage (T1, T2) and academic year (13-14, 14-15) were not. Linear regression also revealed that students who completed both self-assessments had significantly higher average peer assessment ratings (average peer rating in students with both self-assessments = 8.42, no self-assessments = 8.10, self_at_peer = 8.37, self_alone = 8.28) compared to students who completed one or no self-assessments (F = 5.34, p <.01). Conclusions: When used as a professionalism assessment within team-based learning, stand-alone and simultaneous peer and self- assessments are highly correlated within individuals across different courses. However, although self-assessment alone is a significant predictor of self-assessment made at the time of assessing one’s peers, average peer assessment does not predict self-assessment. To explore this lack of predictive power, we classified students into four subgroups based on relative deviation from median peer and self-assessment scores. Group membership was found to be stable for all groups except for those initially sorted into the high self-assessment/low peer assessment subgroup. Members of this subgroup tended to move into the low self- assessment/low peer assessment group at T2, suggesting they became more accurate at self-assessing over time. A small group of individuals remained in the group that consistently rated themselves highly while their peers rated them poorly. Future studies will track these students to see if similar deviations from accurate professional self-assessment persist into the clinical years. In addition, given that students who fail to perform self-assessments had significantly lower peer assessment scores than their counterparts who completed self-assessments in this study, these students may also be at risk for similar professionalism concerns in the clinical years; follow-up studies will examine this possibility. © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954551876"

The American Association of Medical Colleges has recommended that systems-based practice be incorporated into medical schools’ curricula. However, experiential learning in systems-based practice, including practical strategies to improve the quality and efficiency of clinical care, is often absent from or inconsistently included in medical education. Intervention: A multidisciplinary clinician and nonclinician faculty team partnered with a cardiology outpatient clinic to design a 9-month clerkship for 1st-year medical students focused on systems-based practice, delivery of clinical care, and strategies to improve the quality and efficiency of clinical operations. The clerkship was called the Action Research Program. In 2013–2014, 8 trainees participated in educational seminars, research activities, and 9-week clinic rotations. A qualitative process and outcome evaluation drew on interviews with students, clinic staff, and supervising physicians, as well as students’ detailed field notes. Context: The Action Research Program was developed and implemented at the University of California, San Francisco, an academic medical center in the United States. All educational activities took place at the university's medical school and at the medical center's cardiology outpatient clinic. Outcome: Students reported and demonstrated increased understanding of how care delivery systems work, improved clinical skills, growing confidence in interactions with patients, and appreciation for patients’ experiences. Clinicians reported increased efficiency at the clinic level and improved performance and job satisfaction among medical assistants as a result of their unprecedented mentoring role with students. Some clinicians felt burdened when students shadowed them and asked questions during interactions with patients. Most student-led improvement projects were not fully implemented. Lessons Learned: The Action Research Program is a small pilot project that demonstrates an innovative pairing of experiential and didactic training in systems-based practice. Lessons learned include the need for dedicated time and faculty support for students’ improvement projects, which were the least successful aspect of the program. We recommend that future projects aiming to combine clinical training and quality improvement projects designate distinct blocks of time for trainees to pursue each of these activities independently. In 2014–2015, the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine incorporated key features of the Action Research Program into the standard curriculum, with plans to build upon this foundation in future curricular innovations. © 2016, © Taylor & Francis.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963691746"

The concept of bidirectional feedback is appealing as a means of fostering a culture of respectful communication and improvement. However, little is known about how teachers perceive this feedback in practice or how it impacts the learning environment. Approach: We performed 24 semistructured 30- minute interviews with 3 to 7 attending physician faculty members each in Pediatrics, Internal Medicine, Family Medicine, Surgery, Psychiatry, and Obstetrics and Gynecology who taught in 3rd-year required clerkships during the 2012-2013 academic year. Questions probed teachers’ experience with and attitudes toward receiving student feedback. Prompts were used to elicit stories and obtain participant demographics. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and entered into Dedoose for qualitative analysis. Researchers read transcripts holistically for meaning, designed a coding template, and then independently coded each transcript. A constant comparative approach and regular meetings were used to ensure consistent coding between research team members. Findings: Participants ranged in age from 37 to 74, with 5 to 35 years of teaching experience. Seventy- one percent were male, and 83% identified as White. In our preliminary analysis, our informants reported a range of experience in receiving student feedback prior to the end of a clerkship, varying from no experience to having developed mechanisms to regularly request specific feedback about their programs. Most expressed openness to actively soliciting and receiving student feedback on their teaching during the clerkship although many questioned whether this process was feasible. Actual responses to receiving student feedback were mixed. Some reported having received feedback that motivated change, and others rejected the feedback they received on the grounds that it lacked validity or was inappropriate. Others expressed uncertainty about how they would react to student feedback. Faculty expressed a preference for receiving feedback about behaviors and items that were within their control. Insights: These findings suggest there is opportunity to pilot implementation of a structured student feedback mechanism, separate from teacher evaluations, in selected 3rd-year clerkships. Materials should developed to help faculty solicit, understand, and respond to student feedback and to help students frame and provide the kinds of feedback to teachers that will lead to suggested improvements. Both these endeavors have the potential to improve the clinical learning environment during 3rd-year clerkships through the cultivation of respectful communication and the encouragement of improvement in teaching efforts. © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954541842"

However, a systematic review of patients' attitudes toward medical student participation across specialties has not been performed. Approach: The authors searched 7 databases (CINAHL, Cochrane Library, ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science) between January 1, 1999, and August 5, 2014. Two authors independently screened the results and selected articles that were written in English, were published in a peer-reviewed journal, and used a structured or semistructured survey or interview to determine patients' attitudes toward medical student participation in their care. Study quality was assessed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument. Findings: Fifty-nine studies were included. Average study quality was low. Sixty-one unique evaluation instruments were used, and 34 instruments (56%) lacked validity data. Patient satisfaction was not significantly affected by medical student participation. However, patients' acceptance of medical student participation varied widely between studies and depended on the type of participation. The most common reason for acceptance was a desire to contribute to the education of others, and the most common reason for refusal was concerns about privacy. Minorities were more likely to refuse medical student participation. Patients preferred to be informed before medical students participated in their care. Insights: Patient satisfaction is not significantly affected by medical student participation. However, patient satisfaction may be a poor surrogate marker of patients' acceptance of medical students. Future research should employ validated evaluation instruments to further explore patients' attitudes toward medical student participation.

Observation of clinical simulations prior to participation is believed to be beneficial, though this is often a passive process. Active observation may be more beneficial. Hypotheses: The hypothesis tested in this study was that the active use of a simple checklist during observation of an immersive simulation would result in better participant performance in a subsequent scenario compared with passive observation alone. Methods: Medical students were randomized to either passive or active (with checklist) observation of an immersive simulation involving cardiac arrest prior to participating in their own simulation. Performance measures included time to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and time to defibrillation and were compared between first and second scenarios as well as between passive and active observers. Results: Seventy-nine simulations involving 232 students were conducted. Mean time to CPR was 18 seconds (SD = 11.6) for those using the checklist and 24 seconds (SD = 15.8) for those who observed passively (M difference = 6 seconds), t(35) = 1.46, p =.153. Time to defibrillation was 94 seconds (SD = 26.4) for those using the checklist and 92 seconds (SD = 23.8) for those who observed passively (M difference = –2 seconds), t(38) =.21, p =.837. Time to CPR was 24 seconds (SD = 15.8) for passive observers and 31 seconds (SD = 21.0; M difference = 7 seconds), t(35) = 1.13, p =.265, for their first scenario counterparts. Time to CPR was 18 seconds (SD = 11.6) for active observers and 36 seconds (SD = 26.2; M difference = 18 seconds), t(24) = 2.81, p =.010, for their first scenario counterparts. Time to defibrillation was 92 seconds (SD = 23.8) for passive observers and 125 seconds (SD = 32.2; M difference = 33 seconds), t(33) = 3.63, p =.001, for their first scenario counterparts. Time to defibrillation was 94 seconds (SD = 26.4) for the active observers and 132 seconds (SD = 52.9; M difference = 38 seconds), t(28) =.46, p =.008, for their first scenario counterparts. Conclusions: Observation alone leads to improved performance in the management of a simulated cardiac arrest. The active use of a simple skills-based checklist during observation did not appear to improve performance over passive observation alone. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921265820"

In this context it is the first study that allows controlling for students’ prior performance. Background: Computer-based tests make possible a more efficient examination procedure for test administration and review. Although university staff will benefit largely from computer-based tests, the question arises if computer-based tests influence students’ test performance. Approach: A total of 266 German students from the 9th and 10th semester of medicine (comparable with the 4th-year North American medical school schedule) participated in the study (paper = 132, computer = 134). The allocation of the test format was conducted as a randomized matched-pair design in which students were first sorted according to their prior test results. The organizational procedure, the examination conditions, the room, and seating arrangements, as well as the order of questions and answers, were identical in both groups. Results: The sociodemographic variables and pretest scores of both groups were comparable. The test results from the paper and computer versions did not differ. The groups remained within the allotted time, but students using the computer version (particularly the high performers) needed significantly less time to complete the test. In addition, we found significant differences in guessing behavior. Low performers using the computer version guess significantly more than low-performing students in the paper-pencil version. Conclusions: Participants in computer-based tests are not at a disadvantage in terms of their test results. The computer-based test required less processing time. The reason for the longer processing time when using the paper-pencil version might be due to the time needed to write the answer down, controlling for transferring the answer correctly. It is still not known why students using the computer version (particularly low-performing students) guess at a higher rate. Further studies are necessary to understand this finding. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921265656"

Thus, it has been difficult to convey important knowledge related to viewing and interpreting diagnostic radiology images. We sought to determine if we could create a solution for this problem and evaluate whether students exposed to this solution were able to learn imaging concepts pertinent to medical practice. Intervention: We developed University of Saskatchewan Radiology Courseware (USRC), a novel interactive web application that enables preclinical medical students to acquire image interpretation skills fundamental to clinical practice. This web application reformats content stored in Medical Imaging Resource Center teaching cases for BlackBoard Learn™, a popular learning management system. We have deployed this solution for 2 successive years in a 1st-year basic sciences medical school course at the College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan. The “courseware” content covers both normal anatomy and common clinical pathologies in five distinct modules. We created two cohorts of learners consisting of an intervention cohort of students who had used USRC for their 1st academic year, whereas the nonintervention cohort was students who had not been exposed to this learning opportunity. Context: To assess the learning experience of the users we designed an online questionnaire and image review quiz delivered to both of the student groups. Outcome: Comparisons between the groups revealed statistically significant differences in both confidence with image interpretation and the ability to answer knowledge-based questions. Students were satisfied with the overall usability, functions, and capabilities of USRC. Lessons Learned: USRC is an innovative technology that provides integration between Medical Imaging Resource Center, a teaching solution used in radiology, and a Learning Management System. © 2015, Copyright © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921269273"

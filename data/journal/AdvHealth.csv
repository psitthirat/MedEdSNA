The research question was systematized according to the PCC (Population, Concept, and Context) format. A scoping review was performed. A search of multiple bibliographic databases identified 407 papers, of which 21 met the inclusion criteria. The populations of the 21 studies reviewed were composed of professionals in the fields of medicine, nursing, psychology, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and social work, among others. The study contexts were both academic and nonacademic hospitals, mental health institutions, and community settings, and the topics examined were organizational climate, organizational culture, organizational attachment and job satisfaction. The findings from the reviewed studies showed positive effects of IPE interventions on organizational climate and culture, but the results on job satisfaction and organizational attachment were mixed (i.e., positive and no effects following IPE interventions). Research on IPE is worth more attention as IPE could be an effective alternative for the fulfillment of the Quadruple Aim and achieving the third of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, aimed at improving health and well-being. It seems critical for IPE to be positioned as a trend in global health, aiming at boosting human health resources as one of its building blocks and calling the attention of health decision-makers. © The Author(s) 2023.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178229964"

Adaptive support is tailored to student needs, and this is difficult in complex visual tasks as visual problem-solving processes are covert and thus cannot be directly observed by the teacher. Eye-tracking apparatus can measure covert processes and make them visible in gaze displays: visualizations of where a student looks while executing a task. We investigate whether live dynamic gaze displays help teachers in being more adaptive to students’ needs when teaching optical coherence tomography interpretation in one-to-one teaching sessions and whether this fosters learning. Forty-nine students and 10 teachers participated in a one-to-one teaching session in clinical optometry. In the control condition, teachers saw the learning task of the student and could discuss it with them, whereas in the gaze-display condition, teachers could additionally see where the student looked. After the 15-minute teaching session, a test was administered to examine achievement. Furthermore, students filled in the ‘questionnaire on teacher support adaptivity’, and teachers rated how adaptive their support was. Bayesian analyses provide some initial evidence that students did not experience support to be more adaptive in the gaze-display condition versus the control condition, nor were their post-test scores higher. Teachers rated their provided support as being more adaptive in the gaze-display versus the control condition. Further research could investigate if live dynamic gaze displays impact adaptive teaching when used over longer periods or with more teacher training. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189953616"

This expectation is largely based on the underlying assumption that schools are aware of the priority needs in their communities. This paper demonstrates how open-access, pan-national health data can be used to create a reliable health index to assist schools in identifying societal needs and advance social accountability in health professions education. Using open-access data, a psychometric evaluation was conducted to examine the reliability and validity of the Canadian Health Indicators Framework (CHIF) conceptual model. A non-linear confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on 67 health indicators, at the health-region level (n = 97) was used to assess the model fit of the hypothesized 10-factor model. Reliability analysis using McDonald’s Omega were conducted, followed by Pearson’s correlation coefficients. Findings from the non-linear CFA rejected the original conceptual model structure of the CHIF. Exploratory post hoc analyses were conducted using modification indices and parameter constraints to improve model fit. A final 5-factor multidimensional model demonstrated superior fit, reducing the number of indicators from 67 to 32. The 5-factors included: Health Conditions (8-indicators); Health Functions (6-indicators); Deaths (5-indicators); Non-Medical Health Determinants (7-indicators); and Community & Health System Characteristics (6-indicators). All factor loadings were statistically significant (p < 0.001) and demonstrated excellent internal consistency (ω >0.95). Many schools struggle to identify and measure socially accountable outcomes. The process highlighted in this paper and the indices developed serve as starting points to allow schools to leverage open-access data as an initial step in identifying societal needs. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162653873"

This study explored how educators have used social media as a mechanism of dissemination and KT in the literature. A critical scoping review methodology, informed by Engeström’s Activity Theory, was employed. Twelve databases were searched and studies that: (a) addressed health professions educators; (b) described the use of social media for dissemination or KT; (c) focused on a regulated health profession; (d) focused on undergraduate or graduate education; and (e) were published in English or French between 2011 and 2021 were included. Data were analyzed using numerical and qualitative content analyses. Of the 4859 articles screened, 37 were eligible for inclusion. Social media may facilitate knowledge sharing in HPE, but there is a lack of conceptual clarity on what is meant by ‘dissemination’ and ‘KT’. Who is responsible for sharing knowledge, what knowledge is being shared, and the target audiences are not always clear. Multiple factors (e.g., affordances, opportunity costs) influence how social media is used as a mechanism of dissemination, and it remains unclear whether and how it is used as a mechanism of KT. Concepts like KT and dissemination, which are often borrowed from other disciplines, must be critically evaluated for their relevance and suitability if they are to be appropriately applied to HPE and in particular to social media. Educators looking to use social media to teach students about KT should consider whether this use of technology truly aligns with their stated learning outcomes. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174387098"

Research suggests raters can overcome first impressions in experimental exam contexts with explicit first impressions, but these findings may not generalize to a workplace context with implicit first impressions. The study had two aims. First, to assess if first impressions affect raters’ judgments when workplace performance changes. Second, whether explicitly stating these impressions affects subsequent ratings compared to implicitly-formed first impressions. Physician raters viewed six videos where learner performance either changed (Strong to Weak or Weak to Strong) or remained consistent. Raters were assigned two groups. Group one (n = 23, Explicit) made a first impression global rating (FIGR), then scored learners using the Mini-CEX. Group two (n = 22, Implicit) scored learners at the end of the video solely with the Mini-CEX. For the Explicit group, in the Strong to Weak condition, the FIGR (M = 5.94) was higher than the Mini-CEX Global rating (GR) (M = 3.02, p <.001). In the Weak to Strong condition, the FIGR (M = 2.44) was lower than the Mini-CEX GR (M = 3.96 p <.001). There was no difference between the FIGR and the Mini-CEX GR in the consistent condition (M = 6.61, M = 6.65 respectively, p =.84). There were no statistically significant differences in any of the conditions when comparing both groups’ Mini-CEX GR. Therefore, raters adjusted their judgments based on the learners’ performances. Furthermore, raters who made their first impressions explicit showed similar rater bias to raters who followed a more naturalistic process. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177731467"

This study aims to measure the effect of students’ attitude towards risk and ambiguity on their number of correct, wrong, and blank answers. In October 2018, 233 3rd year medical students from the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Porto, in Porto, Portugal, completed a questionnaire which assessed the student’s attitudes towards risk and ambiguity, and aversion to ambiguity in medicine. Simple and multiple regression models and the respective regression coefficients were used to measure the association between the students’ attitudes, and their answers in two examinations that they had taken in June 2018. Having an intermediate level of ambiguity aversion in medicine (as opposed to a very high or low level) was associated with a significant increase in the number of correct answers and decrease in the number of blank answers in the first examination. In the second examination, high levels of ambiguity aversion in medicine were associated with a decrease in the number of wrong answers. Attitude towards risk, tolerance for ambiguity, and gender did not show significant association with the number of correct, wrong, and blank answers for either examination. Students’ ambiguity aversion in medicine is correlated with their performance in multiple-choice examinations with negative marking. Therefore, it is suggested the planning and implementation of counselling sessions with medical students regarding the possible impact of ambiguity aversion on their performance in multiple-choice questions with negative marking. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182458869"

Key to learning from text is the ability to effectively monitor one’s own cognitive performance and take appropriate regulatory steps for improvement. Inferential cues generated during a learning experience typically guide this monitoring process. It has been shown that interventions to assist learners in using comprehension cues improve their monitoring accuracy. One such intervention is having learners to complete a diagram. Little is known, however, about how learners use cues to shape their monitoring judgments. In addition, previous research has not examined the difference in cue use between categories of learners, such as good and poor monitors. This study explored the types and patterns of cues used by participants after being subjected to a diagram completion task prior to their prediction of performance (PoP). Participants’ thought processes were studied by means of a think-aloud method during diagram completion and the subsequent PoP. Results suggest that relying on comprehension-specific cues may lead to a better PoP. Poor monitors relied on multiple cue types and failed to use available cues appropriately. They gave more incorrect responses and made commission errors in the diagram, which likely led to their overconfidence. Good monitors, on the other hand, utilized cues that are predictive of learning from the diagram completion task and seemed to have relied on comprehension cues for their PoP. However, they tended to be cautious in their judgement, which probably made them underestimate themselves. These observations contribute to the current understanding of the use and effectiveness of diagram completion as a cue-prompt intervention and provide direction for future research in enhancing monitoring accuracy. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183401831"

Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through a two-stage sequential design to investigate the hypothesised model. A sample of 645 medical undergraduates participated in the quantitative stage, responding to an electronically structured questionnaire. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling were utilised to analyse the data and assess the fit of the conceptual model. In the qualitative stage, semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposeful sample of twelve medical students, and thematic analysis was employed to explore the qualitative findings. The results indicated a well-fitting model, with significant positive relationships observed among motivation, persistence, and performance accomplishment. Notably, including persistence as a mediator reinforced the relationship between motivation and performance achievement. The qualitative data supported and further emphasised the importance of persistence in the medical student population. The findings have practical implications for medical students, educators, and universities, highlighting the significance of promoting and enhancing learners’ persistence. Suggestions for future research include developing additional statistical models, conducting experimental studies, and undertaking longitudinal investigations. By expanding the understanding of the relationships between motivation, persistence, and performance accomplishment, future studies can contribute to developing effective interventions and strategies to support medical students in their educational journey. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187261088"

However, the translational outcomes of skills acquired through simulation still warrants investigation. We designed this study to assess if skills laboratory training in addition to bedside learning (intervention group [IG]) would provide better learning results than bedside learning alone (control group [CG]) in the context of venipuncture training. This prospective, cluster-randomized, single-blind study took place at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka. Seventeen clusters of second-year medical students were randomly assigned to either IG or CG. The IG trained on venipuncture in the skills laboratory, receiving instruction after modified Payton’s Four Step Method. Following the training, students of both IG and CG underwent bedside learning for one month. Afterward, students of both groups performed venipuncture on actual patients in a clinical setting. An independent, blinded assessor scored students’ performance using the Integrated Procedural Protocol Instrument (IPPI) and a checklist. Patients assessed students’ performance with the Communication Assessment Tool (CAT). Eight and nine clusters were randomized to the intervention and control groups, respectively. IG completed significantly more single steps of the procedure correctly (IG: 19.36 ± 3.87 for checklist items; CG: 15.57 ± 4.95; p < 0.001). IG also scored significantly better on IPPI ratings (median: IG: 27 (12) vs. CG: 21 (8); p < 0.001). Rated by patients, students’ communication skills did not significantly differ between the two groups. Simulation-based venipuncture training enabled students to perform the procedure on actual patients with a higher technical accuracy than students who learned venipuncture at the bedside. Students were able to transfer the skills acquired through venipuncture training at the skill laboratory to the bedside. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174830395"

However, their lives are markedly different compared to their peers. This study argues that while all forms of capital are necessary for success, time as a specific form keeps classism in place. Using constructivist grounded theory techniques, we interviewed 48 FGLI students to understand where, why and how they allocated their time, and the perceived impact it had on them. Using open coding and constant comparison, we developed an understanding of FGLI students’ relationship to time and then contextualized it within larger conversations on how time is conceptualized in a capitalist system that demands time efficiency, and the activities where time is needed in medical school. When students discussed time, they invoked the concept of ‘time famine;’ having too much to do and not enough time. In attempting to meet medicine’s expectations, they conceptualized time as something that was ‘spent’ or ‘given/taken’ as they traversed different marketplaces, using their time as a form of currency to make up for the social capital expected of them. This study shows that because medical education was designed around the social elite, a strata of individuals who have generational resources, time is a critical aspect separating FGLI students from their peers. This study undergirds the idea that time is a hidden organizational framework that helps to maintain classism, thus positioning FGLI students at a disadvantage. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166304497"

Yet combining that role with patient care complicates both roles. So, we need to know how both roles can effectively co-occur. When facilitating their trainees’ learning through practice, supervisors draw on their skills - clinical and supervisory - and available opportunities in their practice. This process can be conceptualised as supervisory knowing in practice (or contextual knowing) and offers ways to elaborate on how facilitating trainees’ learning can be optimised. The practice-based study presented and discussed here examined clinical supervisors’ knowing in practice related to facilitating trainee learning, across three medical specialities. Nineteen clinical supervisors from emergency medicine, internal medicine and surgery, were interviewed about their roles and engagement with trainees. Interview transcripts were analysed in two stages. Firstly, a framework analysis, informed by interdependent learning theory was conducted, focussing on affordances and individual engagement. Secondly, drawing on practice theory, a further layer of analysis was undertaken interrogating supervisors’ knowing in practice. We identified two common domains of supervisor practice used to facilitate trainee learning: (1) orientating and assessing trainees’ readiness (or capabilities), (2) sequencing and enriching pedagogic practices. Yet across the speciality groups the supervisors’ knowing in practice differed and were shaped by a trio of: (i) disciplinary practices, (ii) situational requirements and (iii) clinician preference. Overall, we offer a new reading of clinical supervision as practice differences generated distinct supervisory knowing in practice. These findings emphasise clinical supervision as fundamentally entwined in the speciality’s practice; and reinforce alignments with patient care. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163107595"

One reason may be the limited understanding about how to develop conceptual models with intention and rigor. Group concept mapping (GCM) is a mixed methods conceptualization approach that has been used to develop frameworks for planning and evaluation, but GCM has not been common in HPE. The purpose of this article is to describe GCM in order to make it more accessible for HPE scholars. We recount the origins and evolution of GCM and summarize its core features: GCM can combine multiple stakeholder perspectives in a systematic and inclusive manner to generate explicit conceptual models. Based on the literature and prior experience using GCM, we detail seven steps in GCM: (1) brainstorming ideas to a specific “focus prompt,” (2) preparing ideas by removing duplicates and editing for consistency, (3) sorting ideas according to conceptual similarity, (4) generating the point map through quantitative analysis, (5) interpreting cluster map options, (6) summarizing the final concept map, and (7) reporting and using the map. We provide illustrative examples from HPE studies and compare GCM to other conceptualization methods. GCM has great potential to add to the myriad of methodologies open to HPE researchers. Its alignment with principles of diversity and inclusivity, as well as the need to be systematic in applying theoretical and conceptual frameworks to practice, make it a method well suited for the complexities of contemporary HPE scholarship. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191088855"

Evidence suggests they may enact self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies differently when engaged in self- versus co-regulated learning (Co-RL). We compared the impacts of SRL and Co-RL on trainees’ acquisition, retention, and preparation for future learning (PFL) of cardiac auscultation skills during simulation-based training. In our two-arm, prospective, non-inferiority trial, we randomly assigned first- and second-year medical students to the SRL (N = 16) or Co-RL conditions (N = 16). Across two learning sessions separated by two-weeks, participants practiced and were assessed in diagnosing simulated cardiac murmurs. We examined diagnostic accuracy and learning trace data across sessions, and conducted semi-structured interviews to explore participants’ understandings of their underlying choices and learning strategies. SRL participants’ outcomes were non-inferior to Co-RL participants on the immediate post-test and retention test, but not on the PFL assessment (i.e., inconclusive). Analyzing interview transcripts (N = 31) generated three themes: perceived utility of initial learning supports for future learning; SRL strategies and sequencing of murmurs; and perceived control over learning across sessions. Co-RL participants regularly described relinquishing control of learning to supervisors and regaining it when on their own. For some trainees, Co-RL seemed to interfere with their situated and future SRL. We posit that transient clinical training sessions, typical in simulation-based and workplace-based settings, may not allow the ideal processes of Co-RL to unfold between supervisor and trainee. Future research must examine how supervisors and trainees can share accountability to develop the shared mental models that underlie effective Co-RL. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160402410"

Conceptual clarity is essential to the construction of the knowledge base of medical education and its educational interventions. We conducted a theoretical integrative review across diverse bodies of literature with the goal of understanding what metacognitive reflection is. We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsychInfo, and Web of Science databases, including all peer-reviewed research articles and theoretical papers as well as book chapters that addressed the topic, with no limitations for date, language, or location. A total of 733 articles were identified and 87 were chosen after careful review and application of exclusion criteria. The work of conceptually and empirically delineating metacognitive reflection has begun. Contributions have been made to root metacognitive reflection in the concept of metacognition and moving beyond it to engage in cycles of reflection. Other work has underscored its affective component, transformational nature, and contextual factors. Despite this merging of threads to develop a richer conceptualization, a theory of how metacognitive reflection works is elusive. Debates address whether metacognition drives reflection or vice versa. It has also been suggested that learners evolve along on a continuum from thinking, to task-related reflection, to self-reflection, and finally to metacognitive reflection. Based on prior theory and research, as well as the findings of this review, we propose the following conceptualization: Metacognitive reflection involves heightened internal observation, awareness, monitoring, and regulation of our own knowledge, experiences, and emotions by questioning and examining cognition and emotional processes to continually refine and enhance our perspectives and decisions while thoughtfully accounting for context. We argue that metacognitive reflection brings a shift in perspective and can support valuable reconceptualization for lifelong learning. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2024.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184902119"

This study seeks to understand intrinsic inequity in assessment systems by studying assessment policies and associated procedures in residency training, using general pediatrics as a discourse case study. Foucauldian discourse analysis (FDA) was conducted on assessment policy and procedure documents. Two authors independently prepared structured analytic notes using guiding questions. Documents and respective analytic notes were subsequently reviewed independently by all authors. Each author prepared further unstructured analytic notes on the documents’ discourse. The authors then compared notes and constructed truth statements (i.e., interpretations of what the discourse establishes as true about the construct under study) and sub-strands (i.e., themes) that were repeated and legitimized across the documents via iterative discussion. Based on analysis, the authors constructed two truth statements. These truth statements, “good assessment is equitable assessment,” and “everyone is responsible for inequity,” conceptualized inequity in assessment as an isolated or individual-level aberration in an otherwise effective or neutral system. Closer examination of the truth statements and sub-strands in the discourse presented an alternative view, suggesting that inequity may in fact not be an aberration but rather an inherent feature of assessment systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162641499"

The specific aim of this study was to explore epistemic discourses concerning the development of competence of health professionals with a master’s degree in health science. Accordingly, the study was qualitative and adopted discourse analysis. Twelve participants, all of whom were Norwegian health professionals aged between 29 and 49 years, participated in this study. Four participants were in the final stage of study for their master’s degree with three months left before completion, four had completed their degree two weeks before their participation, and four had been working for one year after the completion of their degree. Data were collected in three group interviews. Three epistemic discourses were revealed: (1) a critical thinking competencies discourse, (2) a scientific thinking competencies discourse, and (3) a competence-in-use discourse. The former two discourses were considered the dominant discourses and indicated that a knowing “that” discourse connected the specialized competence of different health professionals with a wider field of competence. This wider field transcended the boundaries of various health disciplines and represented a novel competence developed through a synergizing process between critical and scientific thinking competencies, which seems to drive continued competence development. A competence-in-use discourse was formed in the process. This discourse can be viewed as a unique outcome that contributes to health professionals’ specialized competence and suggests that a knowing “how” discourse was also an underlying background discourse. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161682155"

The Theory of Social Attachment suggests that preferential selection and distributed training interventions have potential in influencing physician disposition. However, evaluations of these approaches have focused predominantly on rural underservedness, with little research considering physician disposition in other underserved communities. Accordingly, this study investigated the association between the locations from which medical graduates apply to medical school, their undergraduate preclerkship, clerkship, residency experiences, and practice as indexed across an array of markers of underservedness. We built association models concerning the practice location of 347 family physicians who graduated from McMaster University’s MD Program between 2010 and 2015. Postal code data of medical graduates’ residence during secondary school, pre-clerkship, clerkship, residency and eventual practice locations were coded according to five Statistics Canada indices related to primary care underservedness: relative rurality, employment rate, proportion of visible minorities, proportion of Indigenous peoples, and neighbourhood socioeconomic status. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were then developed for each dependent variable (i.e., practice location expressed in terms of each index). Residency training locations were significantly associated with practice locations across all indices. The place of secondary school education also yielded significant relationships to practice location when indexed by employment rate and relative rurality. Education interventions that leverage residency training locations may be particularly influential in promoting family physician practice location. The findings are interpreted with respect to how investment in education policies can promote physician practice in underserved communities. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167888516"

In building and maintaining these datasets, project leaders will need to make decisions about the data. While such decisions are often construed as technical, there are several normative concerns, such as who should have access, how the data will be used, how products resulting from the data will be shared, and how to ensure privacy of the individuals the data is about is respected, etc. Establishing a framework for data governance can help project leaders in avoiding problems, related to such matters, that could limit what can be learned from the data or that might put the project (or future projects) at risk. In this paper, we highlight several normative challenges to be addressed when determining a data governance framework. Drawing from lessons in global health, we illustrate three kinds of normative challenges for projects that rely on data from multiple sources or involved partnerships across institutions or jurisdictions: (1) legal and regulatory requirements, (2) consent, and (3) equitable sharing and fair distribution. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195679234"

This study explores an extracurricular learning approach, called the Social Health Bridge-Building Programme, designed to address health inequities. Student volunteers accompany persons in a socially vulnerable situation to healthcare appointments. Operating outside the realms of health education, the programme intends to provide an alternative road to training healthcare students to become capable of engaging with diverse populations, and reducing barriers to healthcare access. Based on an ethnographic fieldwork, using interviews and participant observation (“walking along”) as methods, the aim of the study was to explore the learning processes and learning outcomes associated with bridge-building, as experienced by students. Our findings show that this extracurricular learning complemented the formal curriculum, and bridged the gap from theoretical knowledge to practice and to real persons, preparing students for their future roles. The particular positioning of walking alongside or sitting beside persons made the invisible visible, enabling student volunteers to see the variety of persons in need of bridge-building, ways of living in a socially vulnerable situation, inequity in health, and see the persons, beyond initial impression, fostering a deeper understanding and empathy among the students. Learning outcomes included communicational, relational, and observations skills, and a more comprehensive grasp of the healthcare system's complexity. We conclude that a non-governmental organization, independent of the healthcare system, may have found a novel way of providing extracurricular learning about health inequity to students. Demonstrating how the Social Health Bridge-Building Programme complements formal curricula, the concept could be applicable in other settings. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178454089"

Our study explores how the field of academic medicine is preparing for this digital future. Method Active strategic plans available in English were collected from faculties of medicine in Canada (n = 14), departments in medical schools (n = 17), academic health science centres (n = 23) and associated research institutes (n = 5). In total, 59 strategic plans were subjected to a practice-oriented form of document analysis, informed by the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries. Results On the one hand, digital health is discursively treated as a continuation of the academic medicine vision, with expansions of physician competencies and of research institutes contributions. These imaginaries do not necessarily disrupt the field of academic medicine as currently configured. On the other hand, there is a vision of digital health pursuing a robust sociotechnical future with transformative implications for how care is conducted, what forms of knowledge are prioritized, how patients and patienthood will be understood, and how data work will be distributed. This imaginary may destabilize existing distributions of knowledge and power. Conclusions Looking through the lens of sociotechnical imaginaries, this study illuminates strategic plans as framing desirable futures, directing attention towards specific ways of understanding problems of healthcare, and mobilizing the resources to knit together social and technical systems in ways that bring these visions to fruition. There are bound to be tensions as these sociotechnical imaginaries are translated into material realities. Many of those tensions and their attempted resolutions will have direct implications for the expectations of health professional graduates, the nature of clinical learning environments, and future relationships with patients. Sociology of digital health and science and technology studies can provide useful insights to guide leaders in academic medicine shaping these digital futures. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194577215"

What are the varied reasons as to why patients get involved with HPE programs? With a focus on understanding what drives patient involvement with HPE programs, this study examined how a patient as teacher (PAT) program was experienced by medical students, patient teachers, and faculty within a medical school. Through a phenomenographic approach, this study captures and describes the different ways our study participants experienced a PAT program (the ‘phenomenon’). 24 semi-structured interviews were conducted in total, comprised of interviews with patient teachers (N = 10), medical students (N = 10) and program facilitators (N = 4) who participated in a PAT program. Our focus was on participants’ description of the program and was grounded in their experiences of as well as their beliefs about it. Our findings captured 4 layers representing the qualitatively different (yet interrelated) ways in which participants experienced/perceived and conceptualized the various aspects of their experience with the PAT program: (1) A productive disruption of the learning space (2) A re-humanization within healthcare (3) A means of empowerment and agency (4) A catalyst for change and emancipation. Our outcome space results can be visually illustrated by a nesting ""Matryoshka"" doll, representing the four layers and depicting the process of uncovering the less conscious layers of sense-making within this phenomenon. HPE programs that are co-produced with patients and actively involve patients as teachers have the potential, but not guarantee, to be emancipatory. To engage in PAT programs that exhibit an emancipatory potential, we need to consider transformative paradigms of education, which are aligned with social change, and disrupt the traditional teacher-learner hierarchy. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164934198"

Activity patterns play an essential role in the adjustment of these patients and, as a pain behaviour, may have a communicative function and elicit distinct empathic responses. This study investigated whether the activity pattern profiles characteristic of these patients had differential effects on the empathic response (empathic distress and compassion/sympathy) of future healthcare professionals. Healthcare professionals should improve their knowledge about the role of different activity patterns in the well-being of people with chronic pain and receive specific training in empathic skills. We controlled for several variables that could affect the empathic response (sex, age, academic degree, previous experience of chronic pain, and dispositional empathy). A total of 228 undergraduates performed an experimental task using vignettes depicting four activity pattern profiles displayed by people with chronic pain and completed questionnaires measuring dispositional and situational empathy. We conducted a MANCOVA analysis. Undergraduates showed more compassion/sympathy toward the medium cycler profile than toward the doer profile. Participants’ age was associated with empathic distress. Sex, academic degree, and previous experiences with chronic pain were not associated with their empathic response to the vignettes. Dispositional perspective-taking and empathic concern were significantly associated with compassion/sympathy responses, and personal distress was significantly associated with empathic distress. Activity pattern profiles may have a communicative function and elicit different empathic responses toward people with chronic pain.

However, most previous research comparing these formats has used small examinee samples testing under low-stakes conditions. Additionally, previous studies have not reported on the time required to respond to the two item types. This study compares the difficulty, discrimination, and time requirements for the two formats when examinees responded as part of a large-scale, high-stakes assessment. Seventy-one MCQs were converted to SAQs. These matched items were randomly assigned to examinees completing a high-stakes assessment of internal medicine. No examinee saw the same item in both formats. Items administered in the SAQ format were generally more difficult than items in the MCQ format. The discrimination index for SAQs was modestly higher than that for MCQs and response times were substantially higher for SAQs. These results support the interchangeability of MCQs and SAQs. When it is important that the examinee generate the response rather than selecting it, SAQs may be preferred. The results relating to difficulty and discrimination reported in this paper are consistent with those of previous studies. The results on the relative time requirements for the two formats suggest that with a fixed testing time fewer SAQs can be administered, this limitation more than makes up for the higher discrimination that has been reported for SAQs. We additionally examine the extent to which increased difficulty may directly impact the discrimination of SAQs. © NBME 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169675165"

Involving service users redefines whose knowledge “counts” and implies a shift in power. Such a shift is especially significant in the mental health field, where power imbalances between health professionals and service users are magnified. However, reviews of the literature on service user involvement in mental health professional education do little to explore how power manifests in this work. Meanwhile critical and Mad studies scholars have highlighted that without real shifts in power, inclusion practices can lead to harmful consequences. We conducted a critical review to explore how power is addressed in the literature that describes service user involvement in mental health professions education. Our team used a co-produced approach and critical theories to identify how power implicitly and explicitly operates in this work to unearth the inequities and power structures that service user involvement may inadvertently perpetuate. We demonstrate that power permeates service user involvement in mental health professional education but is rarely made visible. We also argue that by missing the opportunity to locate power, the literature contributes to a series of epistemic injustices that reveal the contours of legitimate knowledge in mental health professions education and its neoliberal underpinnings. Ultimately, we call for a critical turn that foregrounds power relations to unlock the social justice-oriented transformative potential of service user involvement in mental health professions education and health professions education more broadly. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160403436"

Collaboration among GP-HPE researchers is crucial but challenging. Formulating a research agenda, involving stakeholders, and fostering inter-institutional collaboration can address these challenges and connect educational research and practice. Methods: We used Q-methodology to explore perspectives on GP-HPE research of participants from all Dutch postgraduate GP training institutes. Participants individually sorted statements based on the relevance of future GP-HPE research for educational practice. Data analysis comprised inverted factor analysis, rotation, and qualitative interpretation of configurations of all statements. The National Meeting on Educational Research took a participatory approach. Results: We included 73 participants with diverse involvement in GP-HPE research. We identified five distinct perspectives, each representing a research focus area for developing and innovating GP education: the clinician scientist, the socially engaged GP, the specific GP identity, the GP as an entrepreneur, and the GP engaged in lifelong learning. Discussion: The resulting five perspectives align with General Practice hallmarks. Q-methodology and a participatory approach facilitated collaboration among stakeholders. Successful inter-institutional collaboration requires a common goal, neutral leadership, participant commitment, regular meetings, audit trail support, process transparency, and reflexivity. Future research should address evidence gaps within these perspectives. Conclusion: Using Q-methodology turned out to be valuable for compiling a national research agenda for GP-HPE research. The research process helped to cross boundaries between researchers in different institutions, thus putting inter-institutional collaborative advantage center stage. Our approach could provide a conceivable procedure for HPE researchers worldwide. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194582152"

Seventeen articles were selected for extraction and synthesis. Common curricular goals included improving interprofessional, interpersonal, and empathetic communication. Curricula often lacked alignment between learning objectives and improv exercises. Sessions occurred once (65%) or were longitudinal (35%). Only 24% reported a full description of their intervention. Few reported details on the content of curricula. Evaluations often focused on feasibility and acceptability. Heterogeneity exists in the development, implementation, and assessment of improv curricula. Low-quality evidence was provided to support the use of medical improv to teach communication skills to HP learners. Improv curricula were feasible, and acceptable to learners.

A summary of interventional variables includes article content type, strategy type, assessment type and delay and statistical significance. Of 1818 records retrieved, 56 were eligible for inclusion and included a total of 63 experiments. Of these studies, 43 demonstrated significant benefits of distributed practice and/or retrieval practice over control and comparison groups. Included studies averaged 12.23 out of 18 on the MERSQI and averaged 4.55 out of 6 on the NOS-E.

Future study quality can be improved by validating the assessment instruments, to demonstrate the reliability of outcome measures. Increasing the number of institutions included in future studies may improve the diversity of represented study participants and may enhance study quality.

The main aim of this study was to collate the quantitative results of original studies analyzing the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on a variety of outcomes in medical students. We also analyzed how the study design and characteristics of the intervention affect the results, and identified qualitative effects of mindfulness interventions. A literature search was performed in different databases in June 2020. Original articles meeting the following criteria were included: (1) at least 50% of the participants were medical students, (2) included a mindfulness intervention, (3) analyzed any outcome relating to mindfulness intervention, (4) peer-reviewed (5) written in English. Eventually, 31 articles including 24 different samples were included. Over half of the studies were RCTs. In over half of the studies, the intervention was 4- to 10-week original Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction or Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy or a modification of these. In general, satisfaction with the interventions was good. Based on a meta-analysis, after the intervention, the intervention group had statistically significantly fewer symptoms of stress and distress and had higher mindfulness than the controls. The beneficial effects persisted in follow-ups over months or years. Both long and shorter courses and courses with and without face-to-face sessions were effective. Both controlled and uncontrolled studies had statistically significant results. Qualitative results revealed potential factors behind the quantitative effects. The number of studies on mindfulness interventions in medical students has increased drastically. Mindfulness-based interventions seem to offer a good possibility to enhance medical students’ well-being. © The Author(s) 2023.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160350413"

Our focus is on differential attainment (DA) in postgraduate College (Board) examinations. We asked: Are candidates’ sociodemographic characteristics associated with performance on the UK’s Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (MRCP) Part 1 after adjusting for medical school performance (MSP) and type of medical programme? This was a retrospective longitudinal cohort study of 6040 medical graduates with linked sociodemographic data in the UK Medical Education Database qualifying from a UK medical school (2012–2014) and sitting MRCP Part 1 before October 2019. Chi-squared tests established univariable associations with MRCP performance (pass/fail first sitting MRCP Part 1). Multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression identified independent explanatory factors of success, adjusted for medical school. The odds (95% CI) of passing MRCP Part 1 exams on first sitting were greater for men (OR = 1.61, CI 1.42–1.81, p < 0.001) and those on a graduate entry programme (OR = 1.44, 1.05–1.99, p < 0.001). The odds of passing were lower as age increases (OR = 0.87, 0.85–0.90, p < 0.001), for minority ethnic (OR = 0.61, CI 0.53–0.7, p < 0.001), and gateway to medicine (OR = 0.49, CI 0.27–0.90, p = 0.02) candidates. After adjusting for MSP, odds were greater for passing in men (OR = 1.62, CI 1.24–2.11, p < 0.001) and candidates with higher MSP (OR = 4.12, CI 3.40–4.96, p < 0.001). Our findings illustrate how performance on MRCP part 1 is associated with group-level social and educational factors. This DA may be due to aspects of the assessment itself, and/or the persistent nature of social and educational disadvantage. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212511789"

Undergraduate and postgraduate students in the medical profession are sometimes trained in contexts foreign to their social and ontological backgrounds. This might lead to confusion and blunders, creating an impression of what might look and feel unprofessional to those unfamiliar with the local context. Understanding the cultural backgrounds of the trainees is crucial, and the reverse is also as important. It is essential for clinicians and trainees to understand the cultural backgrounds of their patients to avoid miscommunication. In this phenomenological study, we recruited participants in 2020 who were in their first to fourth year of study of medical training during the #FeesMustFall protests. We used data from this extensive study looking at students’ experiences during their training amidst protest and social upheavals in a South African tertiary institution. For this paper, we examined what professionalism means to the student participants using an African Ubuntu lens. Ubuntu and the Collective Finger theory were used to investigate what professionalism means to participants. The Ubuntu philosophy was compared to the PC. In the findings, the clinical space is hierarchical, silencing and the opposite of what Ubuntu means. In comparison to the PC, respect is overarching while compassion and responsibility are the most comparable to the Charter. This study adds an African voice to the professionalism discourse while showing African elements that could be aligned to the PC to challenge the current global discourses. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171267540"

However, little research has explored the separate contributions of each component to the development of student confidence and treatment fidelity. The dual purpose of this study was to compare the impact of clinical training format (synchronous vs. asynchronous) and education model (traditional vs. collaborative) on student confidence and treatment fidelity. Thirty-six speech-language pathology graduate students completed this two-phase study during a one-term clinical rotation. Phase 1 investigated the impact of training condition (synchronous, asynchronous guided, asynchronous unguided) on student confidence and treatment fidelity. Phase 2 explored the impact of education model (traditional vs. collaborative) on student confidence and treatment fidelity. Treatment fidelity was measured at the conclusion of Phases 1 and 2. Students rated their confidence at six-time points throughout the study. Our results indicate that training condition did not differentially impact student confidence or treatment fidelity; however, education model did: students in the collaborative education model reported increased confidence compared to students in the traditional education model. Students in the collaborative education model also trended towards having higher treatment fidelity than students in the traditional education model. These results demonstrate that pre-clinical trainings can be effective in several different formats provided they cover the discrete skills needed for the clinical rotation. While preliminary, our results further suggest that students may benefit from working with peers during their clinical rotations. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168957259"

Learning theory underpins Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) as a means of safe transition to independent practice. Regulators mandate senior assistantships to improve practice readiness. It is important to know whether meaningful EPAs occur in assistantships, and with what impact. Final year students at one UK medical school kept learning logs and audio-diaries for six one-week periods during a year-long assistantship. Further data were also obtained through interviewing participants when students and after three months as junior doctors. This was combined with data from new doctors from 17 other UK schools. Realist methods explored what worked for whom and why. 32 medical students and 70 junior doctors participated. All assistantship students reported engaging with EPAs but gaps in the types of EPAs undertaken exist, with level of entrustment and frequency of access depending on the context. Engagement is enhanced by integration into the team and shared understanding of what constitutes legitimate activities. Improving the shared understanding between student and supervisor of what constitutes important assistantship activity may result in an increase in the amount and/or quality of EPAs achieved. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162720645"

We explore the discernment process by examining what trainees attend to moments before and while they are resisting to understand how they manage this tension. We interviewed 18 medical trainees who shared stories of resisting social harm and injustice in their training environments. Interviews were analyzed using open and focused coding using Vinthagen and Johansson’s work, which conceptualizes resistance as a dynamic process that includes an individual’s subjectivity within a larger system, the context in which they find themselves, and the interactions they have with others. We framed these acts as an individuals’ attempt to undermine power, while also being entangled with that power and needing it for their efforts. When deciding on how and whether to resist, trainees underwent a cost-benefit analysis weighing the potential risk against their chances at change. They considered how their acts may influence their relationship with others, whether resisting would damage personal and programmatic reputations, and the embodied and social cues of other stakeholders involved. Trainees undergo a dynamic assessment process in which they analyze large amounts of information to keep themselves safe from potential retaliation. It is by attending to these various factors in their environment that trainees are able to keep their acts professional, and continue to do this challenging work in medical education. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2024.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185104870"

A better understanding of student learning is required to address student needs in this crucial phase. The theory of self-regulated learning provides a comprehensive view of learning and could serve as a basis for further research. There are instruments to assess self-regulated learning in preclinical academic learning. However, there are no such instruments for workplace learning. The aim of the present study is to provide a comprehensive inventory from which researchers can select those scales that are relevant to their research questions in the investigation of workplace learning. Hence, the aim is to develop and validate a set of scales to assess undergraduates’ workplace learning in health sciences education in four areas (cognition, motivation, emotion, and context) on two levels (the learning process level and the metalevel). Study 1 is a qualitative multimethod study to identify indicators and develop items. It integrates the perspectives of students, teachers, and researchers and includes six steps: literature review, interviews, synthesis, item development, expert review, and cognitive pretesting. This study yields a set of scales for each area on both levels. Study 2 is a quantitative study to assess the psychometric properties. The results show acceptable values in terms of unidimensionality, reliability and validity for each of the 31 scales. The newly developed Workplace Learning Inventory is comprehensive; the scales are relevant to workplace learning and short enough that their administration is feasible in the workplace setting. The rigorous process of questionnaire development contributes to the validity of scales. By providing the Workplace Learning Inventory, we hope to encourage research on workplace learning in health sciences education from an educational psychology perspective. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176109834"

The stigmatization of disability within medical education affects students’ disability disclosures, yet few studies have explored how understandings of disability influence inclusion practices beyond individual student actions. This paper develops the concept of legibility, derived from a constructivist grounded theory study that examined disability inclusion at four U.S. medical schools through interviews with 19 disabled students and 27 school officials (faculty and administrators). With two dimensions (recognition and assessment of possibility), legibility demonstrates that knowing disability is relational, contextual, and equivocal. Drawing from the field of disability studies, the paper argues that the current paradigm of disability inclusion demands that students’ disability experiences be highly legible to themselves and others, yet increased legibility comes with potential risk due to prevalent ableism. While individual interactions can shift understandings of disability towards greater inclusivity, systemic action that embeds liberating discourses of disability into medical education is needed. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165263239"

In this study, authors explored how assessors scored others if, before assessing others, they received their own assessment score. The authors examined assessments from an established MSF system in which all clinical team members - medical students, interns, residents, fellows, and supervisors - anonymously assessed each other. The authors identified assessments in which an assessor (i.e., any team member providing a score to another) gave an aberrant score to another individual. An aberrant score was defined as one that was more than two standard deviations from the assessment receiver’s average score. Assessors who gave aberrant scores were categorized according to whether their behaviour was preceded by: (1) receiving a score or not from another individual in the MSF system (2) whether the score they received was aberrant or not. The authors used a multivariable logistic regression model to investigate the association between the type of score received and the type of score given by that same individual. In total, 367 unique assessors provided 6091 scores on the performance of 484 unique individuals. Aberrant scores were identified in 250 forms (4.1%). The chances of giving an aberrant score were 2.3 times higher for those who had received a score, compared to those who had not (odds ratio 2.30, 95% CI:1.54–3.44, P < 0.001). Individuals who had received an aberrant score were also 2.17 times more likely to give an aberrant score to others compared to those who had received a non-aberrant score (2.17, 95% CI:1.39–3.39, P < 0.005) after adjusting for all other variables. This study documents an association between receiving scores within an anonymous multi-source feedback (MSF) system and providing aberrant scores to team members. These findings suggest care must be given to designing MSF systems to protect against potential downstream consequences of providing and receiving anonymous feedback. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165599368"

Such effects are usually conceptualised and operationalised based solely on checklist/domain scores in a station, and global grades are not often used in this type of analysis. In this work, a large candidate-level exam dataset is analysed to develop a more sophisticated understanding of examiner stringency. Station scores are modelled based on global grades—with each candidate, station and examiner allowed to vary in their ability/stringency/difficulty in the modelling. In addition, examiners are also allowed to vary in how they discriminate across grades—to our knowledge, this is the first time this has been investigated. Results show that examiners contribute strongly to variance in scoring in two distinct ways—via the traditional conception of score stringency (34% of score variance), but also in how they discriminate in scoring across grades (7%). As one might expect, candidate and station account only for a small amount of score variance at the station-level once candidate grades are accounted for (3% and 2% respectively) with the remainder being residual (54%). Investigation of impacts on station-level candidate pass/fail decisions suggest that examiner differential stringency effects combine to give false positive (candidates passing in error) and false negative (failing in error) rates in stations of around 5% each but at the exam-level this reduces to 0.4% and 3.3% respectively. This work adds to our understanding of examiner behaviour by demonstrating that examiners can vary in qualitatively different ways in their judgments. For institutions, it emphasises the key message that it is important to sample widely from the examiner pool via sufficient stations to ensure OSCE-level decisions are sufficiently defensible. It also suggests that examiner training should include discussion of global grading, and the combined effect of scoring and grading on candidate outcomes. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174165356"

The purpose of this study is to use the theory of temporal agency to explore how first-year medical students who identify as women draw upon past, future, and present agency to resist the patriarchal system of medicine. The data for this study were drawn from the first year (October 2020-April 2021) of a longitudinal project using narrative inquiry to understand the socialization of women students in undergraduate medical education. Fifteen participants performed two interviews and a series of written reflection prompts about their childhood and medical school experiences, each lasting approximately 45 min. Participants’ resistance drew on past resources, recognizing themselves as Other, which contributed to categorically locating themselves as part of a broader resisting community, even outside their institution. They also hypothesized future possibilities as part of resistance, either an ideal future where they would exercise power, or an unchanged one and the hypothetical resolutions they would use to manage it. Finally, they contextualized past and future in the present, identifying problems to make strategic decisions and execute actions. Our creative interweaving of the constructs of temporal agency, communal agency, and resistance allows us to paint a nuanced picture of how these women conceive of themselves as part of a larger group of women amidst the hierarchical, patriarchal structures of medical school while, at times, internalizing these hierarchies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164530919"

However, expert judgment is indispensable in many contexts. In medical education, experts often function as examiners in rater-based assessments. Here, disagreement between examiners can have far-reaching consequences. The literature suggests that inconsistencies in ratings depend on the level of performance a to-be-evaluated candidate shows. This possibility has not been addressed deliberately and with appropriate statistical methods. By adopting the theoretical lens of ecological rationality, we evaluate if easily implementable strategies can enhance decision making in real-world assessment contexts. Methods: We address two objectives. First, we investigate the dependence of rater-consistency on performance levels. We recorded videos of mock-exams and had examiners (N=10) evaluate four students’ performances and compare inconsistencies in performance ratings between examiner-pairs using a bootstrapping procedure. Our second objective is to provide an approach that aids decision making by implementing simple heuristics. Results: We found that discrepancies were largely a function of the level of performance the candidates showed. Lower performances were rated more inconsistently than excellent performances. Furthermore, our analyses indicated that the use of simple heuristics might improve decisions in examiner pairs. Discussion: Inconsistencies in performance judgments continue to be a matter of concern, and we provide empirical evidence for them to be related to candidate performance. We discuss implications for research and the advantages of adopting the perspective of ecological rationality. We point to directions both for further research and for development of assessment practices. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191058395"

Structural competency refers to the development of analytical skills that reveal the larger societal context beyond the patient-clinician interaction that shapes health outcomes. The growing adoption of structural competency curricula, however, has revealed that prelicensure and early career health professionals can feel overwhelmed by the mismatch between the wide scale of entrenched problems and the limited scope of their therapeutic skills. In this Reflections paper, I draw on theories from Giddens, Bourdieu, and Foucault to restore a role for individual agency in promoting health. Conceiving of structure and agency as mutually constituting suggests that structures are human-made and can be vulnerable to challenge. Structures, however, disperse power to such an extent that people internalize their rules and discipline themselves to follow them without explicit enforcement. It is precisely in those local sites of power that health professions learners and educators can intervene to interrupt the reproduction of structures harmful to health. As I demonstrate with an example from a reproductive health emergency, being structurally competent may also include contesting agreed upon norms at the level of the learning and clinical environments rather than only macro-level societal forces. Rewriting norms within health professions education and clinical practice is not necessarily a simpler task, but it provides learners and educators with more accessible targets for action. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175373532"

Educators are increasingly expected to include some form of pastoral care in their role. Mental health-related interactions with students may have a negative emotional impact on educators, particularly when roles and expectations are not clearly defined and where boundaries are not managed effectively. Using positioning theory as a lens, this study explored how educators experienced such interactions and how this manifested in positions, storylines, and speech acts. Interviews were conducted with 27 HP educators at a faculty of medicine and health sciences. Reflexive thematic analysis using inductive coding identified themes corresponding to the nearing, weighted, ambivalent, and distancing positions participants adopted in relation to students with mental health difficulties. There was fluidity in and between positions, and more than one position could be occupied simultaneously; participants each moved through different positions in response to different relational situations. Multiple storylines informed these positions, representing how moral- and care-informed responsibility intersected with responsiveness to make certain actions possible or impossible. Normative and personal value narratives were evident in storylines, in many cases underscored by care or justice ethics. The value of positioning theory in facilitating reflective faculty development initiatives for educators engaged in these interactions is discussed. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161466360"

However, there is a need to better understand the complex interplay between institutional guidelines and how teachers decode those guidelines and assign value to teaching merits. To gain a deeper understanding of this dynamic, this study employed a sociological analysis to understand how medical educators aspiring to professorships use MEPs to display their teaching merits and how cultural capital is reflected in these artefacts. We collected 36 medical educator portfolios for promotion from a large research-intensive university and conducted a deductive content analysis using institutional guidelines that distinguished between mandatory (accounting for the total body of teaching conducted) and optional content (arguing for pedagogical choices and evidencing the quality, respectively). Our analysis showed that the portfolios primarily included quantifiable data about teaching activities, e.g., numbers of students, topics and classes taught. Notably, they often lacked evidence of quality and scholarship of teaching. Looking at these findings through a Bourdieusian lens revealed that teachers in this social field exchange objectified evidence of hours spent on teaching into teaching capital recognized by their institution. Our findings highlight how institutional guidelines for MEPs construct a pedagogical battlefield, where educators try to decode and exchange the “right” and recognized teaching capital. This indicates that MEPs reflect the norms and practices of the academic field more than individual teaching quality. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191791461"

While health professions education has a long history of interaction with patients or consumers, a shift in the way consumer and community engage in health-related education has created novel opportunities for mutual relationships valuing lived experience expertise and shifting traditional education power relations. Drawing on a mixed methods design, we explored consumer and community involvement practices in the design and delivery of health-related education using the capability, opportunity, motivation and behaviour framework (COM-B). In our results, we describe educator capabilities, opportunities and motivations, including identifying barriers and enablers to consumer and community involvement in health-related education. Educators have varying philosophical reasons and approaches for involving consumers and community. There is a focus on augmenting student learning through inclusion of lived and living experience, and on mutual transformative learning through embedding lived experience and co-creating learning. How these philosophical positionings and motivations shape the degree by which educators involve consumers and community members in health-related curricula is important for further understanding these educational partnerships within universities. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178473136"

Our analysis advances a conceptualization of collaboration that takes place within a work culture of creativity and community, that includes four modes of collaboration, or the ways theatre practitioners collaborate, by: (1) paying attention to and traversing roles and hierarchies; (2) engaging in reciprocal listening and challenging of others; (3) developing trust and communication, and; (4) navigating uncertainty, risk and failure.

This article reports on a systematic review aimed at providing an overview of different approaches in this context, describing their effectiveness, and thematically comparing learning outcomes across different undergraduate programs. The authors searched PubMed, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Scopus databases for articles published between 2000 and January 2021. Quantitative and qualitative studies that reported on outcomes related to learners’ knowledge, skills, and attitudes following an intervention with virtual patients in undergraduate psychiatry education were reviewed. Outcomes were thematically compared, and a narrative synthesis of the different outcomes and effectiveness was provided. Of 7856 records identified, 240 articles were retrieved for full-text review and 46 articles met all inclusion criteria. There were four broad types of virtual patient interventions: case-based presentation (n = 17), interactive virtual patient scenarios (n = 14), standardized virtual patients (n = 10), and virtual patient videogames (n = 5). The thematic analysis revealed that virtual patients in psychiatry education have been used for learners to construe knowledge about symptomatology and psychopathology, develop interpersonal and clinical communicative skills, and to increase self-efficacy and decrease stigmatizing attitudes towards psychiatric patients. In comparison with no intervention, traditional teaching, and text-based interventions, virtual patients were associated with higher learning outcomes. However, the results did not indicate any superiority of virtual patients over non-technological simulation. Virtual patients in psychiatry education offer opportunities for students from different health disciplines to build knowledge, practice skills, and improve their attitudes towards individuals with mental illness. The article discusses methodological shortcomings in the reviewed literature. Future interventions should consider the mediating effects of the quality of the learning environment, psychological safety, and level of authenticity of the simulation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161394266"

Participants’ (N = 34) reasoning processes were investigated with written tasks utilizing eye-tracking in combination with verbal protocols. The case was presented in three pages, each page being followed by written questions. Eye movements were recorded during case processing. Success in the task required differentiating the relevant information from the task redundant information, and initial activation of several scripts and verification of the most likely one, when additional information became available. 2nd (n = 16) and 3rd (n = 18)-year students’ and better and worse succeeding students’ processes were compared. The results showed that only a few 2nd-year students solved the case correctly, whereas almost all of the 3rd-year students were successful. Generally, the average total processing times of the case material did not differ between the groups. However, better-succeeding and 3rd-year students processed the very first task-relevant sentences longer, indicating that they were able to focus on relevant information. Differences in the written answers to the 2nd and 3rd question were significant, whereas differences regarding the first question were not. Thus, eye-tracking seems to be able to capture illness script activation during case processing, but other methods are needed to depict the script verification process. Based on the results, pedagogical suggestions for advancing pharmacy education are discussed. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160849324"

This paper explores how reflecting on personal life experiences and considering the relevance for one’s future professional practice can inform first-year medical students’ initial explorations of professional identities. In this narrative inquiry, we undertook a dialogical narrative analysis of 68 essays in which first-year medical students reflected on how personal experiences from before medical school may influence them as future doctors. Students wrote the texts at the end of a 6-month course involving 20 patient encounters, introduction to person-centered theory, peer group discussions, and reflective writing. The analysis targeted medical students’ processes of interweaving and delineating personal and professional identities. The analysis yielded four categories. (1) How medical students told their stories of illness, suffering, and relational struggles in an interplay with context that provided them with new perspectives on their own experiences. Students formed identities with a person-centered orientation to medical work by: (2) recognizing and identifying with patients’ vulnerability, (3) experiencing the healing function of sharing stories, and (4) transforming personal experiences into professional strength. Innovative approaches to medical education that encourage and support medical students to revisit, reflect on, and reinterpret their emotionally charged life experiences have the potential to shape professional identities in ways that support person-centered orientations to medical work. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187283917"

Many assessment approaches are available to support selection; but how are decisions about building, monitoring, and adapting admissions systems made? What shapes the processes and practices that underpin selection decisions? We explore how these decisions are made across several Canadian medical schools, and how values shape the creation, monitoring, and adaptation of admissions systems. Using phenomenography (a qualitative method suited to examining variability), the authors analyzed interviews with 10 current or previous heads of admissions from 10 different undergraduate medical education programs in Canada. Interviews were conducted in English and French, and data was collected between 2016 and 2017 (therefore participants no longer hold these roles). Data was coded and analyzed iteratively, focusing on identifying underlying values, and exploring how these values shape admissions practices and considerations for validity. Eight different intersecting values were identified. Of these, four were shared across all participants: critically questioning the process and tools, aiming for equity, striving for better, and embracing the challenges of change. The expression of these values depended on different contextual variables (e.g., geographic location, access to expertise, resource availability), and values shaped how admissions systems were built, enacted, and monitored for quality. Ultimately, values shaped: (1) admissions practices resulting in different candidates being offered admission, and (2) how arguments supporting score interpretation are built (i.e., validity). This study documents various values that influence admissions processes, practices, and quality monitoring. The values that shape what is assessed, how it is assessed, and how fair and defensible practices are conceptualized have significant impact, ultimately determining who is selected. These values—whether implicit or explicit—result in intended and unintended consequences in selection processes. However, these values are rarely explicitly examined and questioned, leaving it uncertain as to which consequences are the intended outcomes of deliberately chosen values, and which are unintended consequences of implicitly held values of admissions systems and their actors. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178877493"

Since trainees and supervisors both contribute to entrustment decisions, we examined the cognitive and affective factors that underly their negotiation of trust, and whether trainee demographic characteristics may bias them. Using a document analysis approach, we adapted large language models (LLMs) to examine feedback dialogs (N = 24,187, each with an associated entrustment rating) between medical student trainees and their clinical supervisors. We compared how trainees and supervisors differentially documented feedback dialogs about similar tasks by identifying qualitative themes and quantitatively assessing their correlation with entrustment ratings. Supervisors’ themes predominantly reflected skills related to patient presentations, while trainees’ themes were broader—including clinical performance and personal qualities. To examine affect, we trained an LLM to measure feedback sentiment. On average, trainees used more negative language (5.3% lower probability of positive sentiment, p < 0.05) compared to supervisors, while documenting higher entrustment ratings (+ 0.08 on a 1–4 scale, p < 0.05). We also found biases tied to demographic characteristics: trainees’ documentation reflected more positive sentiment in the case of male trainees (+ 1.3%, p < 0.05) and of trainees underrepresented in medicine (UIM) (+ 1.3%, p < 0.05). Entrustment ratings did not appear to reflect these biases, neither when documented by trainee nor supervisor. As such, bias appeared to influence the emotive language trainees used to document entrustment more than the degree of entrustment they experienced. Mitigating these biases is nonetheless important because they may affect trainees’ assimilation into their roles and formation of trusting relationships. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185471231"

The article explores supervisory practices across disciplines and proposes a holistic reconceptualization of clinical supervision in surgery. From various perspectives, the importance of hands-on opportunities in the operation theatre and the challenges trainees encounter in gaining practical experience are emphasized. Strategies aimed at improving clinical supervision and enhancing surgical education are suggested. By addressing these challenges and providing more opportunities for hands-on training across specialties, surgical education programs can better prepare trainees for the demands of their future careers while ensuring high-quality patient care. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Letter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169809411"

The study’s objective is to provide valuable insights for improving educational practices across different institutions. Data were gathered from six medical schools: McMaster University, the Northern Ontario School of Medicine University, Queen’s University, University of Ottawa, University of Toronto, and Western University. The dataset includes graduates who undertook the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination Part 1 (MCCQE1) between 2015 and 2017. The data were categorized into five distinct sections: demographic information as well as four matrices: admissions, course performance, objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), and clerkship performance. Common and unique variables were identified through an extensive consensus-building process. Hierarchical linear regression and a manual stepwise variable selection approach were used for analysis. Analyses were performed on data set encompassing graduates of all six medical schools as well as on individual data sets from each school. For the combined data set the final model estimated 32% of the variance in performance on licensing exams, highlighting variables such as Age at Admission, Sex, Biomedical Knowledge, the first post-clerkship OSCE, and a clerkship theta score. Individual school analysis explained 41–60% of the variance in MCCQE1 outcomes, with comparable variables to the analysis from of the combined data set identified as significant independent variables. Therefore, strongly emphasising the need for variety of high-quality assessment on the educational continuum. This study underscores the importance of sharing data to enable educational insights. This study also had its challenges when it came to the access and aggregation of data. As such we advocate for the establishment of a common framework for multi-institutional educational research, facilitating studies and evaluations across diverse institutions. This study demonstrates the scientific potential of collaborative data analysis in enhancing educational outcomes.

Little is known regarding how belonging is experienced by medical students from groups that face systemic oppression and exclusion. We employed a sequential explanatory mixed methods design to explore how students from equity-deserving groups (EDGs) experience belonging during medical school, including those who are women, racialized, Indigenous, disabled, and 2SLGBTQIA+. First, we conducted a national cross-sectional survey of medical students (N = 480) measuring four constructs: belonging, imposter syndrome, burnout, and depression. Belonging scores were overall lower for students from EDGs and, more specifically, significantly lowest amongst racialized students. Structural equation models show that poor sense of belonging precedes imposter syndrome and further exacerbates burnout and depression. Next, we sampled and interviewed students (N = 16) from the EDG whose belonging scores were significantly lowest. Participants described the essence of belonging as being able to exist as one’s “true self” while emphasizing feelings of acceptance, comfort, and safety as well as being valued and seen as an equal - yet described how routine experiences of “othering” inhibited a sense of belonging, often due to differences in social identity and structural privilege. Poor sense of belonging negatively affected learners’ well-being and career trajectory. We illuminate the range of psychological and professional consequences associated with diminished sense of belonging and highlight the need to expand traditional notions of equity, diversity, and inclusion to consider structural barriers to belonging. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167506588"

This effect may depend on how students value formative, and summative assessments differently. Informed by Expectancy Value Theory, we compared test preparation, feedback use, and test-taking motivation of medical students who either took a purely formative progress test (formative PT-group) or a progress test that yielded study credits (summative PT-group). In a mixed-methods study design, we triangulated quantitative questionnaire data (n = 264), logging data of an online PT feedback system (n = 618), and qualitative interview data (n = 21) to compare feedback use, and test-taking motivation between the formative PT-group (n = 316), and the summative PT-group (n = 302). Self-reported, and actual feedback consultation was higher in the summative PT-group. Test preparation, and active feedback use were relatively low and similar in both groups. Both quantitative, and qualitative results showed that the motivation to prepare and consult feedback relates to how students value the assessment. In the interview data, a link could be made with goal orientation theory, as performance-oriented students perceived the formative PT as not important due to the lack of study credits. This led to low test-taking effort, and feedback consultation after the formative PT. In contrast, learning-oriented students valued the formative PT, and used it for self-study or self-assessment to gain feedback. Our results indicate that most students are less motivated to put effort in the test, and use feedback when there are no direct consequences. A supportive assessment environment that emphasizes recognition of the value of formative testing is required to motivate students to use feedback for learning. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188142282"

To date, the three sectors—education/research, practice, and policy/regulation—that support SP have been working relatively independently. The goals of this project were to (a) understand how representatives of the three sectors conceptualize SP; (b) define each sector’s individual and collective roles in supporting SP; (c) identify factors influencing the enactment of SP and the specific needs of how best to support SP; and (d) co-develop goals and strategies to support SP across all sectors. We used interpretive description methodology. Consistent with an integrated knowledge translation approach, partners representing the three sectors across Canada recruited individuals from each sector, developed the content and questions for three focus groups, and collected and analyzed the data. Inspired by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, we developed the questions for the second focus group. We analyzed the data using an inductive thematic analysis method. Thirty-nine participants from the three sectors participated. Themes related to participants’ conceptualization of SP included (a) ongoing process, (b) reflective process, (c) broad concept, and (d) collective effort. Themes describing factors influencing and supporting SP were (a) recognition, (b) appropriate conceptualization, (c) social network, (d) accessibility to resources, and (e) forces outside of practitioners’ effort. Goals to support SP included (a) further recognizing SP, (b) sustaining SP competency, and (c) ensuring access to information. SP requires collaborative and integrated intersectoral support and further recognition of its importance through the collaboration of multiple stakeholders. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177792413"

Although an assessment tool may be soundly constructed, it may still prove inadequate in practice by failing to function as intended. Therefore, more insight is needed into the effects of the DCRT in practice. Individual semi-structured interviews and template analysis were used to collect and process qualitative data. The template, based on the interview guide, contained six themes: (1) DCRT itself, (2) test debriefing, (3) reflection, (4) practice/workplace, (5) DCRT versus practice and (6) ‘other’. Thirteen students were interviewed. The DCRT encourages students to engage more in formal education, self-study and workplace learning during their clerkships, particularly for those who received insufficient results. Although the faculty emphasizes the different purposes of the DCRT (assessment of/as/for learning), most students perceive the DCRT as an assessment of learning. This affects their motivation and the role they assign to it in their learning process. Although students appreciate the debriefing and reflection report for improvement, they struggle to fill the identified knowledge gaps due to the timing of receiving their results. Some students are supported by the DCRT in exhibiting lifelong learning behavior. This study has identified several ways in which the DCRT influences students’ learning practices in a way that can benefit their clinical-reasoning skills. Additionally, it stresses the importance of ensuring the alignment of theoretical principles with real-world practice, both in the development and utilization of assessment tools and their content. Further research is needed to investigate the long-term impact of the DCRT on young physicians’ working practice. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174426213"

Educators utilize implementation science frameworks to disseminate clinical evidence-based practices (EBP). The Health Equity Implementation Framework (HEIF) is one of these frameworks, and it delineates how health equity may be concomitantly assessed and addressed in planning the implementation of an EBP. The HEIF therefore lays a strong foundation to understand and explain barriers and facilitators to implementation through an equity lens, making it well-suited for use by medical educators. Three equity-focused frames of reference within the model include (1) the clinical encounter, (2) societal context, and (3) culturally relevant factors, herein referred to as domains. The HEIF provides a structure for prospective and retrospective assessment of how EBP are taught and ultimately incorporated into clinical practice by trainees, with specific attention to delivering equitable care. We present three examples of common topics in internal medicine, contextualized by the three equity domains of the HEIF. We additionally acknowledge the limitations of this framework as a research tool with complex features that may not be suitable for brief teaching in the clinical environment. We propose a 360-degree learner assessment to ensure implementation of this framework is successful. By encouraging trainees to explore the narrative experiences of their patients and examine their own implicit biases, the HEIF provides a structure to address gaps in knowledge about delivering equitable care. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169824918"

Error interventions cannot feasibly be implemented for every patient that is seen. To identify cases at high risk of error, clinicians should have a good calibration between their perceived and actual accuracy. This experiment studied the impact of feedback on medical interns’ calibration and diagnostic process. In a two-phase experiment, 125 medical interns from Dutch University Medical Centers were randomized to receive no feedback (control), feedback on their accuracy (performance feedback), or feedback with additional information on why a certain diagnosis was correct (information feedback) on 20 chest X-rays they diagnosed in a feedback phase. A test phase immediately followed this phase and had all interns diagnose an additional 10 X-rays without feedback. Outcome measures were confidence–accuracy calibration, diagnostic accuracy, confidence, and time to diagnose. Both feedback types improved overall confidence–accuracy calibration (R2No Feedback = 0.05, R2Performance Feedback = 0.12, R2Information Feedback = 0.19), in line with the individual improvements in diagnostic accuracy and confidence. We also report secondary analyses to examine how case difficulty affected calibration. Time to diagnose did not differ between conditions. Feedback improved interns’ calibration. However, it is unclear whether this improvement reflects better confidence estimates or an improvement in accuracy. Future research should examine more experienced participants and non-visual specialties. Our results suggest that feedback is an effective intervention that could be beneficial as a tool to improve calibration, especially in cases that are not too difficult for learners. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162069800"

Competency-based medical education frameworks have been developed to this end, but efforts to identify behaviours and activities that define competence are based on mapping knowledge, skills and ability, which can be difficult to integrate into a comprehensive picture of who the trainee is becoming. Professional identity formation, in contrast, prioritizes attention to who trainees are becoming, but provision of detailed guidance to preceptors on how to best support this form of development is challenging. The tension that results limits our ability to optimally support learners as strengths in competency development may mask professional identity development gaps and vice versa. To address this tension, this paper examines how the theory of threshold concepts – troublesome ideas that, once appreciated, fundamentally change how you understand and approach a particular activity – can shine light on professional identity formation and its relationship with developing competence. The recognition and identification of threshold concepts is offered as a means to improve our ability to identify, discuss and support behaviours and actions that impact the learner’s capacity to act competently as they develop their identity at various stages of training. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160701644"

Explanations for such variability need exploration. The aim of our study was to understand what clinical learning, whilst under socially distanced restrictions, worked and why (or why not). Methods: We conducted a realist evaluation of the undergraduate healthcare programmes at one UK university in 2020–21. Initial programme theories to be tested in this study were derived from discussions with programme leads about the changes they implemented due to the pandemic. Study participants were students and teaching faculty. Online interview transcripts were coded, identifying why interventions had worked or not. This resulted in a set of ‘context-mechanism-outcome’ (CMO) statements about each intervention. The initial programme theories were refined as a result. Results and discussion: 29 students and 22 faculty members participated. 18 CMO configurations were identified relating to clinical skills learning and 25 relating to clinical placements. Clinical skills learning was successful whether in person, remote or hybrid if it followed the steps of: demonstration—explanation—mental rehearsal—attempt with feedback. Where it didn’t work there was usually a lack of observation and corrective feedback. Placements were generally highly valued despite some deficiencies in student experience. Being useful on placements was felt to be good preparation for practice. If student numbers are to expand, findings about what works in distance learning of clinical skills and the value of various modes of induction to clinical workplace activity may also be relevant post-pandemic. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178893713"

This study proposed that both how students view themselves personally (i.e., impostor syndrome) and how they view themselves in relation to the group (i.e., identification with the profession) are identity factors related to related to feedback orientation during clinical rotations. 177 third-year medical students enrolled in a four-phase longitudinal survey study beginning at the start of clinical rotations and continuing every twelve weeks of the academic year thereafter. Feedback orientation was conceptualized and measured as comprising aspects of utility (i.e., feedback is valuable and useful), sensitivity (i.e., feeling intimidated or threatened by corrective feedback), confidentiality (i.e., public/private context of feedback), and retention (i.e., feedback remembered). Results indicated that these aspects of feedback orientation did not significantly change during the third year. Instead, impostor syndrome was at least marginally, significantly associated with all aspects of feedback orientation across phases. Group identity was associated with feedback utility and retention, and female-identifying students reported significantly greater feedback confidentiality and feedback retention. Interventions may be needed to improve medical students’ attitudes about feedback, particularly for those who experience impostor syndrome. Fostering group cohesion among medical students may influence how well students remember feedback and find it useful. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164497401"

Using a data-driven approach, the inter-relations among different medical fields were decomposed and clustered based on the similarity of their working environments. Publicly available, aggregate databases were merged into a single rich dataset containing demographic, working environment and remuneration information for physicians across Canada. These data were collected from the Canadian Institute for Health Information, the Canadian Medical Association, and the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, primarily from 2018 to 2019. The merged dataset includes 25 unique medical specialties, each with 36 indicator variables. Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) was used to group specialties into distinct clusters based on relatedness. The 25 medical specialties were decomposed into seven clusters (latent variables) that were chosen based on the Bayesian Information Criterion. The Kruskal-Wallis test identified eight indicator variables that significantly differed between the seven profiles. These variables included income, work settings and payment styles. Variables that did not significantly vary between profiles included demographics, professional satisfaction, and work-life balance satisfaction. The 25 analyzed medical specialties were grouped in an unsupervised manner into seven profiles via LPA. These profiles correspond to expected and meaningful groups of specialties that share a common theme and set of indicator variables (e.g. procedurally-focused, clinic-based practice). These profiles can help aspiring physicians narrow down and guide specialty choice. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171140330"

Often schools focus on implementing and reporting individual-level interventions which typically only address one aspect of wellbeing. Conversely, less attention has been paid to holistic school-wide approaches towards student wellbeing that address multiple wellbeing dimensions. Thus, this review sought to improve our understanding of how support is mediated within such school-wide wellbeing programmes. Method: This critical narrative review was conducted in two stages. First, the authors searched several key databases for papers published up to 25th May 2021, using a systematic search strategy and TREND checklist to guide our data extraction process. We later expanded our search to include literature published from the original date to 20th May 2023. Second, the identified articles were critically analysed using activity theory as a theoretical lens to aid explanation. Results: We found school-wide wellbeing programmes emphasize social connectivity and building a sense of community. Tutors take a key role in the activity of supporting students’ wellbeing. We mapped out the activity system components to describe the complexity of this tutor role. This analysis illustrated: tensions and contradictions in the system which may open up opportunities for change; the importance of context for influencing how system components interact; and that students’ trust underpins the whole activity system. Conclusions: Our review shines a light into the black-box of holistic school-wide wellbeing programmes. We identified that tutors play a key role in wellbeing systems but confidentiality is a recurring tension which may jeopardise a wellbeing system. The time has come to investigate these systems in more detail, embracing and exploring the role of context at the same time as looking for common threads. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163846967"

Serious games in its entirety have already proven their teaching effectiveness in different educational contexts including medical education. The embedded game design elements play an essential role for a game’s effectiveness and thus they should be selected based on evidence-based theories. For game design elements embedded in serious games used for the education of medical and healthcare professions, an overview of theories for the selection lacks. Additionally, it is still unclear whether and how single game design elements affect the learning effectiveness. Therefore, the main aim of this systematic review is threefold. Firstly, light will be shed on the single game design elements used in serious games in this area. Second, the game design elements’ underlying theories will be worked out, and third, the game design elements’ effectiveness on student learning outcome will be assessed. Two literature searches were conducted in November 2021 and May 2022 in six literature databases with keywords covering the fields of educational game design, serious game, and medical education. Out of 1006 initial records, 91 were included after applying predefined exclusion criteria. Data analysis revealed that the three most common game design elements were points, storyline, and feedback. Only four underlying theories were mentioned, and no study evaluated specific game design elements. Since game design elements should be based on theories to ensure meaningful evaluations, the conceptual GATE framework is introduced, which facilitates the selection of evidence-based game design elements for serious games. © The Author(s) 2024.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189198236"

As students have different characteristics and they do not learn and progress at the same pace, it is important to identify student subgroups and address their academic needs to create more equitable learning opportunities. Using latent class growth analysis, this study explored students’ developmental trajectories and detected group differences based on their coursework performance in Anatomy within the two years of preclinical education in one medical school. Four subgroups were identified with various intercepts and slopes. There were significant group differences between these subgroups and their standardized scores in MCAT and UCMLE Step 1.

While the identification and structured definition of objectives and outcomes have evolved, many methods employed to assess clerkship students’ clinical skills remain relatively unchanged. There is a paucity of medical education research applying advanced statistical design and analytic techniques to investigate the validity of clinical skills assessment. One robust statistical method, multitrait-multimethod matrix analysis, can be applied to investigate construct validity across multiple assessment instruments and settings. Four traits were operationalized to represent the construct of critical clinical skills (professionalism, data gathering, data synthesis, and data delivery). The traits were assessed using three methods (direct observations by faculty coaches, clinical workplace-based evaluations, and objective structured clinical examination type clinical practice examinations). The four traits and three methods were intercorrelated for the multitrait-multimethod matrix analysis. The results indicated reliability values in the adequate to good range across the three methods with the majority of the validity coefficients demonstrating statistical significance. The clearest evidence for convergent and divergent validity was with the professionalism trait. The correlations on the same method/different traits analyses indicated substantial method effect; particularly on clinical workplace-based assessments. The multitrait-multimethod matrix approach, currently underutilized in medical education, could be employed to explore validity evidence of complex constructs such as clinical skills. These results can inform faculty development programs to improve the reliability and validity of assessments within the clinical environment. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166424560"

Whilst most students pass these placements, a small percentage of students will fail or be at risk of failing. Supporting students undergoing a failing experience is a time critical, time consuming, emotional and resource-heavy task which is often undertaken by key university staff and impacts all stakeholders. Whilst several studies have provided insight into this experience from the educator and/or university perspective, this scoping review aimed to identify the students’ experience of failing or nearly failing a professional practice experience. Following Arskey and O’Malley’s framework for scoping reviews, 24 papers were included in this review. This review generated six themes including the reasons for failure, how failure looks and feels, how supports, service and strategies influence the student experience of failure, the importance of communication, relationships and organisational culture, the impact infrastructure and policies have, and the consequences of failure. The outcomes of this scoping review highlighted three key characteristics of the research to date: (a) the student voice is still largely missing; (b) the student perspective is distinctly different to that of other stakeholders; and (c) the interventions used appear not to be student-informed or student-led. Better understanding this experience from the student’s perspective could create a more sustainable practice education environment by designing and implementing more effective supports, services or strategies that reduce the overall impact a failing experience has on students and key stakeholders. © The Author(s) 2023.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161429436"

We compared the efficacy of pure procedural knowledge (three-point checklist for evaluating skin lesions) versus combined procedural plus conceptual knowledge (histological explanations for each of the three points). All students then trained their classification skills with a visual learning resource that included images of two types of pigmented skin lesions: benign nevi and malignant melanomas. Both treatments produced significant and long-lasting effects on diagnostic accuracy in transfer tasks. However, only students in the combined procedural plus conceptual knowledge condition significantly improved their diagnostic performance in classifying lesions they had seen before in the pre- and post-tests. Findings suggest that the provision of additional conceptual knowledge supported error correction mechanisms. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178941994"

A known stress-response is a measurable reduction in heart rate variability. It is currently unknown if crisis simulation can elicit the same stress response as real clinical emergencies. We aim to compare heart rate variability changes amongst medical trainees during simulated and real medical emergencies. We performed a single center prospective observational study, enrolling 19 resident physicians. Heart rate variability was measured in real time, using a 2-lead heart rate monitor (Bodyguard 2, Firstbeat Technologies Ltd) worn during 24 h critical care call shifts. Data was collected at baseline, during crisis simulation and when responding to medical emergencies. 57 observations were made to compare participant’s heart rate variability. Each heart rate variability metric changed as expected in response to stress. Statistically significant differences were observed between baseline and simulated medical emergencies in Standard Deviation of the N–N interval (SDNN), Root mean square standard deviation of the N–N interval (RMSSD), Percentage of successive R–R intervals that differ by more than 50 ms (PNN50), Low Frequency (LF) and Low Frequency: High Frequency ratios (LF:HF). No statistically significant differences between simulated and real medical emergencies were identified in any heart rate variability metrics. We have shown using objective results, that simulation can elicit the same psychophysiological response as actual medical emergencies. Therefore, simulation may represent a reasonable way to practice not only essential skills in a safe environment but has the additional benefit of creating a realistic, physiological response in medical trainees. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164528070"

Underpinned by the extrapolation inference in Kane’s Validity Framework, the purpose of this study is to determine whether OSCEs translate to real life performance by comparing students’ OSCE performance to their performance in real-life (as a WBA) using the same clinical scenario, and to understand factors that affect students’ performance. A sequential explanatory mixed methods approach where a grade comparison between students’ performance in their OSCE and WBA was performed. Students were third year pharmacy undergraduates on placement at a community pharmacy in 2022. The WBA was conducted by a simulated patient, unbeknownst to students and indistinguishable from a genuine patient, visiting the pharmacy asking for health advice. The simulated patient was referred to as a ‘mystery shopper’ and the process to ‘mystery shopping’ in this manuscript. Community pharmacy is an ideal setting for real-time observation and mystery shopping as staff can be accessed without appointment. The students’ provision of care and clinical knowledge was assessed by the mystery shopper using the same clinical checklist the student was assessed from in the OSCE. Students who had the WBA conducted were then invited to participate in semi-structured interviews to discuss their experiences in both settings. Overall, 92 mystery shopper (WBA) visits with students were conducted and 36 follow-up interviews were completed. The median WBA score was 41.7% [IQR 28.3] and significantly lower compared to the OSCE score 80.9% [IQR 19.0] in all participants (p < 0.001). Interviews revealed students knew they did not perform as well in the WBA compared to their OSCE, but reflected that they still need OSCEs to prepare them to manage real-life patients. Many students related their performance to how they perceived their role in OSCEs versus WBAs, and that OSCEs allowed them more autonomy to manage the patient as opposed to an unfamiliar workplace. As suggested by the activity theory, the performance of the student can be driven by their motivation which differed in the two contexts. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171592475"

Patient-teachers were invited to participate in small group discussion workshops during which medical students deliberate on legal, ethical, and moral issues arising from medical practice. Patients were expected to bring other perspectives, based on their experience with illness and the healthcare system. Little is still known about patients’ perspectives on their participation experience in such context. Informed by critical theory, our qualitative study aims to document,: (i) the motivating factors for patients’ participation in our intervention; and (ii) what patients gained from the experience. Data collection was based on 10 semi-structured interviews with patient-teachers. A thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo software. Motivators for participation arose from: (i) perceived consistency between patients’ individual characteristics and those of the project, and (ii) conceiving the project as a means to reach individual and social goals. What patients gained mainly refers to (1) the appreciation of a positive, enriching, motivating yet uncomfortable and destabilizing experience; (2) a deconstruction of biases against the medical field and critical thinking about their own experience; (3) new knowledge, with a potential impact on their future interactions with the healthcare system. Results reveal patients as non-neutral thinking and knowing subjects, engaged in the participation experience as active teachers and learners. They also highlight the empowering and emancipatory nature of the learning gained through patients’ participation experience. These conclusions prompt us to promote transformative interventional approaches that question the pervasive power issues in medical teaching and value patients’ specific knowledge in teaching and learning the Art of Medicine. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163620338"

Documents created by residents for purposes of reflection are often used for a second, summative purpose—to help competence committees make decisions—which may be problematic. Using inductive, thematic analysis we analyzed written comments generated by 21 resident-AA dyads in one large internal medicine program who met over a 2 year period to determine what residents write when asked to reflect, how this aligns with what the AAs report, and what changes occur over time (total 109 resident self-reflections and 105 AA reports). Residents commented more on their developing autonomy, progress and improvement than AAs, who commented far more on performance measures. Over time, residents’ writing shifted away from intrinsic roles, patient care and improvement towards what AAs focused on, including getting EPAs (entrustable professional activities), studying and exams. For EPAs, the emphasis was on getting sufficient numbers rather than reflecting on what residents were learning. Our findings challenge the practice of dual-purposing documents, by questioning the blurring of formative and summative intent, the structure of forms and their multiple conflicting purposes, and assumptions about the advising relationship over time. Our study suggests a need to re-evaluate how reflective documents are used in CBME programs. Further research should explore whether and how documentation can best be used to support resident growth and development. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186588640"

Particularly, U.S. studies have demonstrated empathy declines during clinical training in the third and fourth year of traditional medical programs. Yet, studies conducted outside the U.S. have not confirmed this trend. Timing and extent of patient interactions have been identified as empathy-protective factors. The need to examine empathy within different learning contexts has been noted, as has the need for longitudinal and time-series research designs to analyze trajectories. Between fall 2010 and spring 2019, we assessed empathy longitudinally among six student cohorts (N = 493) at a U.S. medical school, where patient interaction occurs early and throughout an integrated curriculum. Empathy levels of students in each cohort were assessed at five time points utilizing the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy-Student version. We hypothesized empathy levels will not degrade by program end, and trajectories will not show patterns of decline in Years Three and Four. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Linear Mixed Model (LMM) analyses were used to analyze differences at baseline and changes in empathy trajectories. ANOVA analyses revealed statistically significant differences at baseline by class cohort (F(5, 487) = [23.28], p < 0.001). LMM analyses indicated empathy was either significantly higher or not different at the end of the program (F(19, 1676) = [13.97], p < 0.001). Empathy trajectories varied among cohorts; yet, none resulted in an overall empathy decline by the end of the program. Findings demonstrate empathy in U.S. medical students can be unchanged or higher by the end of medical education. Outcomes are consistent with reports of non-declining medical student empathy outside the U.S. and support the notion of context-specificity. Results further support recent research, suggesting decreases in empathy during training can stabilize or increase by program end. These findings have important implications for future empathy research context and design considerations, as well as program planning. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176241793"

In 2010, the American Society of Teachers of Family Medicine approved 19 competencies for teaching integrative medicine to residents. In 2018, the University of Rennes created a course: “Integrative Medicine and Complementary Therapies”. Up until then, the only feedback from the courses was the students’ opinions. We investigated the impact on medical students’ social representation. We performed a sociological analysis of students’ social representations before and after the course. The social representation is based on the way an individual creates his or her universe of beliefs and ideas. After hearing, “What word or group of words comes to mind when you hear people speak of integrative medicine and complementary therapies?”, students were asked to provide 5 words/phrases, rank their importance, and show their attitude towards these words/phrases. The frequency and importance of these words/phrases were used to construct social representations (with central cores, and primary and secondary peripheries) before and after the course. Among the 101 students registered, 59 provided complete responses before and 63 after the course. Before, the central core comprised “hypnosis” and “alternative medicine”, while after: “complementary care” and “global care”. We only identified first periphery before the course: “acupuncture” and “homeopathy”. 4 new contrasting elements: “integration with conventional treatment”, “patient’s choice”, “personalisation of care”, and “caring relationship of trust”. This teaching course positively affected students’ social representation of integrative medicine, and might promote their use during future practices. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188104985"

The factors contributing to this discrepancy are currently unknown, but may result from an interplay of individual and systemic barriers to entering medicine. This collaborative, analytic autoethnography aimed to use the experiences of ‘Meg’, a fourth-year medical student who was diagnosed as dyslexic whilst at medical school, to explore how the lack of a diagnosis during the admissions process may have impacted her journey into medicine. The data were collected using reflective writing and an interview before conducting a thematic analysis. Our analysis resulted in the construction of two meta-themes, relating to the negative emotional impact of not having a diagnosis and feelings of inferiority. Seven themes were also constructed. Some explored how Meg’s personal experience of undiagnosed dyslexia acted as a barrier to entering medicine. Others explored the impact of external factors, such as socio-economic background and the provision of support, on an individual’s chance of successfully applying to medical school. Finally, we explored the inadvertent impact undiagnosed (and unrecognised) dyslexia had on Meg’s life course, including how medicine-specific aptitude tests, such as the BMAT and UKCAT, may have contributed to this. These results provide a unique window into the culture of applying to medical school as an undiagnosed dyslexic person, whilst discussing the need for medical schools to consider how their admissions processes may inadvertently disadvantage undiagnosed dyslexic applicants. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164479023"

Virtual OSCEs were used in place of in-person OSCEs during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, their reliability is yet to be robustly analyzed. By applying generalizability (G) theory, this study aimed to evaluate the reliability of a hybrid OSCE, which admixed in-person and online methods, and gain insights into improving OSCEs’ reliability. During the 2020–2021 hybrid OSCEs, one examinee, one rater, and a vinyl mannequin for physical examination participated onsite, and a standardized simulated patient (SP) for medical interviewing and another rater joined online in one virtual breakout room on an audiovisual conferencing system. G-coefficients and 95% confidence intervals of the borderline score, namely border zone (BZ), under the standard 6-station, 2-rater, and 6-item setting were calculated. G-coefficients of in-person (2017–2019) and hybrid OSCEs (2020–2021) under the standard setting were estimated to be 0.624, 0.770, 0.782, 0.759, and 0.823, respectively. The BZ scores were estimated to be 2.43–3.57, 2.55–3.45, 2.59–3.41, 2.59–3.41, and 2.51–3.49, respectively, in the score range from 1 to 6. Although hybrid OSCEs showed reliability comparable to in-person OSCEs, they need further improvement as a very high-stakes examination. In addition to increasing clinical vignettes, having more proficient online/on-demand raters and/or online SPs for medical interviews could improve the reliability of OSCEs. Reliability can also be ensured through supplementary examination and by increasing the number of online raters for a small number of students within the BZs. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174387242"

Recent evidence demonstrates that perfectionism is widespread among students and on the rise, with recent generations of students placing increasingly more importance on perfection. Whilst the extant literature is vast, it tends to focus on psychopathology and identification of perfectionism correlates rather than the experience of student perfectionism. Furthermore, the education literature is scant and there is a need to understand the deeper processes and nuances of perfectionism, particularly within health professions education where intense study demands, competition to gain entry to educational programmes, and professional cultures may nurture the problem. This phenomenological study explored the lived experiences of ten physiotherapy students as they wrestled with perfectionism in the various facets of their studies. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken, and participants completed log sheets to document perfectionism-related experiences. Idiographic profiles were composed and interview transcripts were analysed, drawing upon features of both phenomenological and thematic analysis. Perfectionism was found to have toxic consequences for the learning experience. Harmful phenomenological experiences included perpetual and excessive achievement striving, punitive self-criticism and health and wellbeing difficulties. A range of sabotaging learning behaviours such as self-handicapping and feedback avoidance was also illuminated, and cultural and organisational influences perceived to foster perfectionism emerged.

To help residents synthesize and use these data, some programs have appointed academic advisors (AA) to ‘coach over time’. This study explored how resident and faculty AA dyads perceived their relationship developing and evolving, and the extent to which it aligned with ‘coaching over time’. Over a two-year period at four separate time-points, we conducted longitudinal qualitative interviews with nine dyads of Internal Medicine residents (32 interviews) and their paired AA (27). We used constructivist grounded theory to develop a conceptual understanding of how AA-resident relationships evolved. Three major themes were identified. ‘Building the Relationship’ included elements perceived to facilitate or impede growth of the relationship. Most relationships flourished, facilitated by passage of time, ‘fit’ between the two, and often by working together clinically. Still, many residents perceived the need to ‘save face’ with their AAs. ‘Enacting the AA Role’ had features that appeared to align more with mentorship than coaching. ‘Finding Meaning in the Relationship’ underscored the perceived value fostered by the longitudinal pairing. The relationships often, but not always, achieved far-reaching benefits, though not necessarily limited to those intended by the program. Our study helps us understand what ‘coaching over time’ might look like for large residency programs wherein residents rotate through many sites and services. The dyads created an opportunity for a coaching relationship to form and develop in beneficial ways, though it was different to and went beyond the narrower focus on meeting CBME requirements. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212503192"

Through a sociomaterial perspective, we can better understand IPE and IPC practices by foregrounding the material aspect of learning and working together and examining its relationship with humans and their interactions. This article aimed to examine existing literature that discusses the application of sociomaterial perspectives in IPE and IPC. A scoping review was conducted following Arksey and O’Malley’s framework to explore the extent within the current body of knowledge that discuss how sociomaterial perspective is applied in IPE and IPC practices. A systematic database search was performed in September 2021 to retrieve literature published from 2007 onwards, with forty-three papers meeting the inclusion criteria. These papers included research articles, book chapters, conference papers and commentaries, with the majority originating from Europe. The thematic analysis revealed the following themes: (1) power as a sociomaterial entity shaping IPE and IPC; (2) inclusion of non-health professionals in reimagining IPE and IPC practices, and (3) the critical understanding of sociomateriality. The findings suggest that a sociomaterial perspective can allow for the reimagination of the contemporary and future practices of interprofessionalism. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169156456"

This is especially true for emergency departments (EDs) where the framework of adaptive expertise has gained traction. When medical graduates start residency in the ED, they must be supported in becoming adaptive experts. However, little is known about how residents can be supported in developing this adaptive expertise. This was a cognitive ethnographic study conducted at two Danish EDs. The data comprised 80 h of observations of 27 residents treating 32 geriatric patients. The purpose of this cognitive ethnographic study was to describe contextual factors that mediate how residents engage in adaptive practices when treating geriatric patients in the ED. Results showed that all residents fluidly engaged in both adaptive and routine practices, but they were challenged when engaging in adaptive practices in the face of uncertainty. Uncertainty was often observed when residents’ workflows were disrupted. Furthermore, results highlighted how residents construed professional identity and how this affected their ability to shift between routine and adaptive practices. Residents reported that they thought that they were expected to perform on par with their more experienced physician colleagues. This negatively impacted their ability to tolerate uncertainty and hindered the performance of adaptive practices. Thus, aligning clinical uncertainty with the premises of clinical work, is imperative for residents to develop adaptive expertise. © The Author(s) 2023.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163779038"

Understanding how these IMSs make career decisions can help better address the issue of global medical workforce shortage. However, such research is limited. Our study aims to explore the career decision-making process of China-educated IMSs, the challenges they experienced and the strategies they employed. In this exploratory qualitative study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with IMSs educated in China in 2022 using purposeful sampling. Twenty virtual one-on-one interviews were conducted, and data were analysed through directed qualitative content analysis. Cognitive Information Processing (CIP) theory was applied as the guiding framework for organising and analysing the data. The career decision-making process of the participants generally followed the stages of decision-making cycle in CIP theory, with a combination of urgent migration decisions and specialisation considerations adding layers of complexity to their career trajectories. Identified challenges encompassed lack of knowledge about oneself and career options, lack of decision-making skills, concerns of contextual complexities that limited the career decision-making process, low motivation and negative thoughts. Specific challenges due to their role as IMSs arose, which were related to career information access, self-capability evaluation, degree accreditation, employment competitiveness and mental states. Participants’ proposed strategies were categorised into personal and institutional aspects, providing insights into addressing these challenges. This study substantiates and expands the application of the CIP theory within the sphere of the particular cultural and educational context of IMSs educated in China. It highlights the significance of integrating migration decision-making into career guidance for IMSs, and contributes to the literature by proposing an evidence-based tiered career intervention programme for IMSs. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189876463"

The hidden curriculum (HC)—defined as a set of values informally conveyed to learners through clinical role-modeling—is a LE socialization construct that has been critically examined for its role in shaping students’ professional identities. Yet differences in how URMs and non-URMs experience the HC remain underexplored. The study used a pragmatic approach that drew on elements of grounded theory and employed both deductive and inductive reasoning. Investigators conducted qualitative, semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 13 URM and 21 non-URM participants at a Bronx, NY medical school. Interviews examined student experiences and reactions to the HC. Both cohorts witnessed patient disparagement and mistreatment. However, from these encounters, URM participants expressed more moral injury—the adverse emotional consequence of feeling pressured to accept ideologically incongruent values. URMs were also more likely to describe resisting the HC. Differences in group reactions appeared to arise from URMs’ identity resonance with patients’ lived experiences. Participants across cohorts emphasized increasing URM recruitment as one step toward mitigating these circumstances. URM participants experienced more distress and offered more resistance to the HC relative to non-URMs. The etiology of these differential reactions may stem from relative barriers in negotiating personal and professional identities. As such, URMs’ perceptions of the LE may be adversely impacted given their more negative interactions with the HC. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163647653"

Eye-tracking technology can visualize viewing behavior in gaze displays, thereby providing information about visual search and decision-making. We hypothesized that individually adaptive gaze-display feedback improves posttest performance and self-monitoring of medical students who learn to detect nodules in radiographs. We investigated the effects of: (1) Search displays, showing which part of the image was searched by the participant; and (2) Decision displays, showing which parts of the image received prolonged attention in 78 medical students. After a pretest and instruction, participants practiced identifying nodules in 16 cases under search-display, decision-display, or no feedback conditions (n = 26 per condition). A 10-case posttest, without feedback, was administered to assess learning outcomes. After each case, participants provided self-monitoring and confidence judgments. Afterward, participants reported on self-efficacy, perceived competence, feedback use, and perceived usefulness of the feedback. Bayesian analyses showed no benefits of gaze displays for post-test performance, monitoring accuracy (absolute difference between participants’ estimated and their actual test performance), completeness of viewing behavior, self-efficacy, and perceived competence. Participants receiving search-displays reported greater feedback utilization than participants receiving decision-displays, and also found the feedback more useful when the gaze data displayed was precise and accurate. As the completeness of search was not related to posttest performance, search displays might not have been sufficiently informative to improve self-monitoring. Information from decision displays was rarely used to inform self-monitoring. Further research should address if and when gaze displays can support learning. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188991948"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the extent to which an SSRL diary can develop SRL and provide a reliable longitudinal assessment of SRL development in academically low-achieving undergraduate medical students. We conducted a quasi-experimental study with low-achieving medical students at Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The intervention was a weekly SSRL diary, with 21 items in two parts (before and after studying) that was integrated with weekly explicit SRL training. A repeated measures ANOVA was performed to assess the participants' SRL development across time. We conducted generalizability theory analysis in two designs; the first was to assess the reliability of the total diary score in assessing low-achieving medical students’ SRL and the second was to assess the efficacy of the four-week intervention results in improving the low-achieving medical students’ SRL. Each participant (n = 20) completed four SSRL diaries. There were significant positive changes during the intervention in the students’ measures of total SRL, time estimation of study, time spent on study, concentration, elaboration, organization, self-monitoring, and self-evaluation. The absolute and relative generalizability coefficients for the first design, which indicates the reliability of the students’ SRL scores, were 0.71 and 0.77.

Despite numerous studies exploring the perception of healthcare professional students (HCPS) of their LE, the validity evidence of the utilized questionnaires remains unclear. This scoping review aimed to identify questionnaires used to examine the perception of undergraduate HCPS of their LE and to assess their validity evidence. Five key concepts were used: (1) higher education; (2) questionnaire; (3) LE; (4) perception; and (5) health professions (HP). PubMed, ERIC, ProQuest, and Cochrane databases were searched for studies developing or adapting questionnaires to examine LE. This review employed the APERA standards of validity evidence and Beckman et al. (J Gen Intern Med 20:1159–1164, 2005) interpretation of these standards according to 5 categories: content, internal structure, response process, relation to other variables, and consequences. Out of 41 questionnaires included in this review, the analysis revealed a predominant emphasis on content and internal structure categories. However, less than 10% of the included questionnaires provided information in relation to other variables, consequences, and response process categories. Most of the identified questionnaires received extensive coverage in the fields of medicine and nursing, followed by dentistry. This review identified diverse questionnaires utilized for examining the perception of students of their LE across different HPs. Given the limited validity evidence for existing questionnaires, future research should prioritize the development and validation of psychometric measures. This will ultimately ensure sound and evidence-based quality improvement measures of the LE in HP education programs. © The Author(s) 2024.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191813857"

Curricula constrained by these challenges can leave graduates without formal preparation for practice conditions. Dual role or overlapping relationships are an example: they continue to be taught as boundary crossings amidst mounting evidence that they must be routinely navigated in small, interconnected communities. In this study, we examined how physicians are navigating overlapping personal (non-sexual) and professional relationships with the goal to inform teaching and curricula on professional boundaries. Following constructivist grounded theory methodology, 22 physicians who had returned to their rural, northern and/or remote hometown in British Columbia, Canada or who had lived and practised in a such a community for decades were interviewed in iterative cycles informed by analysis. We identified four strategies described by physicians for regulating multiple roles within overlapping relationships: (a) signalling the appropriate role for the current context; (b) separating roles by redirecting an interaction to an appropriate context; (c) switching roles by pushing the appropriate role forward into the context and pulling other roles into the background; and (d) suspending an interfering role by ending a relationship. Negotiating boundaries within overlapping relationships may involve monitoring role clarity and role alignment, while avoiding role conflict. The enacted role regulation strategies could be critically assessed within teaching discussions on professional boundaries and also analyzed through further ethics research. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169910161"

Experimental comparison studies, which compare one instructional design against another, can generate much needed evidence in support of effective design strategies. However, experimental comparison studies are often not equipped to generate evidence regarding the mechanisms through which strategies operate. Therefore, simply conducting experimental comparison studies may not provide educators with all the information they need to design more effective instruction. To generate evidence for the what and the why of design strategies, we advocate for researchers to conduct experimental comparison studies that include mediation or moderation analyses, which can illuminate the mechanisms through which design strategies operate. The purpose of this article is to provide a conceptual overview of mediation and moderation analyses for researchers who conduct experimental comparison studies in instructional design. While these statistical techniques add complexity to study design and analysis, they hold great promise for providing educators with more powerful information upon which to base their instructional design decisions. Using two real-world examples from our own work, we describe the structure of mediation and moderation analyses, emphasizing the need to control for confounding even in the context of experimental studies. We also discuss the importance of using learning theories to help identify mediating or moderating variables to test. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202516215"

As part of this effort, trainees are exposed to the values and cultures of the profession in a process known as socialization. Learners must then negotiate incongruent aspects between their preexisting identities and nascent professional identities. Individuals from historically underrepresented ethnic groups often undergo more significant changes due to their values and culture not being as prevalent within the dominant ideology of medicine. This transformative process can lead to identity dissonance and manifest as an internal discomfort resulting from perceived contradictions between one's existing identity and the required professional identity. Identity dissonance may be traumatic and pose a threat to the academic performance and professional integration of trainees. These detrimental effects harm the medical workforce by depriving it of a group crucial in addressing health inequities. Educators tasked with facilitating the professional development of learners must consider their implicit expectations about professionalism, explore the distinct challenges experienced by individuals from underrepresented backgrounds in their professional development, and work to develop strategies to help trainees navigate identity dissonance. Subjectification, an education philosophy that focuses on compelling individuals to explore the new possibilities and responsibilities imparted to them by their education, provides a theoretical framework to help educators guide learners through identity dissonance. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197722639"

Studies suggest that social resources, including a sense of belonging, inclusivity from social groups, and having strong social identities can facilitate positive transitions. However, little is known about the role these resources play in junior doctors’ transitions into the healthcare community. This study aimed to explore the implications of having access to social resources for junior doctors. This study undertook secondary analysis from a longitudinal qualitative study which followed 19 junior doctors (residents within two years of qualification) for nine months. Data were thematically analysed using an abductive approach, with the social identity resource and belongingness (SIRB) model as a conceptual lens to explore how social networks of support act as identity resources (IRs) for junior doctors as they experience transitions. The doctors narrated that having accessible IRs in the form of supportive workplace relationships enabled an integration and a sense of belonging into healthcare practice, supported the construction of new professional identities, and strengthened career intentions. Those with inaccessible IRs (i.e. poor workplace relationships) expressed a lack of belonging, and casted doubt on their identity as a doctor and their career intentions. Our study indicates that SIRB model would be beneficial for medical educators, supervisors, and managers to help them understand the importance and implications of having IRs within the workplace environment and the consequences of their accessibility for healthcare staff experiencing transitions. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199379367"

In this study, we draw on Goffman’s seminal work on stigma to explore supervisors’ accounts of judging performance and managing remediation in specialty anesthesia training in Australia and New Zealand. In doing so, we focus on what Goffman calls a “stigma theory” to explain the supervisors’ reported practices. We performed a secondary analysis of nineteen interviews originally gathered using purposive sampling to explore how assessment decisions were made. We conducted a theory-informed thematic analysis of the supervisors’ accounts to identify signifiers of stigma and underlying structures and beliefs. From both deductive and inductive analysis, we developed themes that demonstrate how the stigma of underperformance influences and is induced by supervisors’ reticence to discuss underperformance, their desire to conceal remediation, and their differential treatment of trainees. We also found that accounts of trainees ‘lacking insight’ resembled stigma-induced stereotyping. We argue from our data that our cultural expectations of perfectionism propagate a stigma that undermines our efforts to remediate underperformance and that our remediation practices inadvertently induce stigma. We suggest that a multifaceted approach using both individual and collective action is necessary to change both culture and practice and encourage the normalisation of remediation. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206841406"

Disability is one aspect of diversity that is increasing in healthcare. While the number of Disabled students in health professions increases, barriers in their work integrated learning (WIL), such as placements in hospitals or clinics, persist. While literature has addressed some of these barriers, there is less known about the social processes that enable access in work integrated learning when it does occur. Therefore, an interdisciplinary team from design, geography, occupational science, nursing, occupational therapy, critical disability studies, and knowledge mobilization explored questions regarding social processes involved in WIL accessibility in clinical settings. The team conducted twenty-five in-depth interviews with 4 placement coordinators, 8 placement supervisors, 6 access professionals, 4 education leaders (e.g. Deans) and 3 healthcare leaders (e.g. site education leaders) from two hospitals and two universities in eastern Canada. The team’s collaborative thematic analysis of participant narratives constructed four themes regarding the invisible work clinical and academic educators engage in to create access: putting in extra time, doing emotional labour, engaging in relational work, and navigating complexities. This labour is unrecognized and optional, and therefore its result—access to education—is inequitably distributed. Educators, policy makers, and institutions need to know how access is created in WIL to promote diversity within health professions and systems. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153384725"

While past research has examined how characteristics of the medical student or specialties influence this decision, we introduce temporal elements as novel variables influencing career selection decisions in medicine. Specifically, we investigate how timing and duration of residency options, based on a rotation schedule that medical students have limited control over, influence their career selection decisions. An archival study investigating 5 years of medical student rotation schedules (N = 115) reveals that clinical rotation options appearing earlier and more often in the schedule were more likely to be selected. Moreover, timing and duration of exposure interacted such that residency options appearing later in the schedules were more likely to be selected if they also appeared more often. Conditional logistic regressions using student fixed-effects to control for idiosyncratic medical student differences (i.e., gender, & debt, etc.), and residency fixed-effects to control for idiosyncratic residency differences (income, and lifestyle, etc.), revealed the rotation schedule had a significant impact on residency selection decisions even when controlling for factors typically influencing this decision. Medical students’ career decisions are influenced by when and how long different choice options appear in their rotation schedule, especially when they have limited influence over this schedule. The results have implications for healthcare policy by highlighting a tool for adjusting physician workforce composition by broadening exposure to a greater array of career options. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85156131852"

Some research into the experiences of these new groups of doctors has been performed. However, no previous research into the experiences of psychiatry residents specifically, is known. This qualitative study investigates how psychiatry residents, from these minoritized groups, experience their training regarding inclusion. Inclusion is defined as the degree to which one’s needs for connection and for being valued in one’s uniqueness, is satisfied. In-depth interviews with 16 psychiatry residents were conducted. These interviews were transcribed and coded using MaxQDA software. Initial themes that were constructed, were explored further in subsequent interviews and linked to literature. Finally, the developed themes were ordered in a model conceptualizing inclusion. Participants reported high belongingness within psychiatry training. Their experienced value in uniqueness, however, was generally quite low. Participants reported to experience little interest in and sensitivity for their perspectives and lived experiences from their co-workers. When faced with stigmatization and discrimination, participants reported lack of support from their colleagues. Assimilation was found to be the most frequently used coping strategy in dealing with diversity. Participants seemed to conform to the ‘neutral’ norm and experienced barriers in expressing themselves. Through this mechanism of assimilation, the added value that participants might bring with their unique knowledge and lived experiences was not used, both in patient care and in creating an inclusive climate within the organization. Moreover, assimilation is associated with psychological strain. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160296273"

Establishing a new medical school is, however, a complex undertaking with high financial and political stakes. Critically, the evidence-base for this significant activity has not previously been elucidated. This paper presents the first scoping review on this vitally important, yet under-researched aspect of medical education and health workforce planning. To better understand the process of new medical school establishment, this review posed two research questions: (1) What is the nature of the available literature on establishing a new medical school?; (2) What are the key factors to be considered when establishing a new medical school? Five databases and grey literature were searched in 2015 and 2021 for English-language articles, using search terms related to new medical schools and their establishment. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were based on relevance and suitability in answering the research questions. Seventy-eight articles were analysed both structurally and thematically to understand the nature of the literature and the key considerations involved. Structurally, most articles were descriptive pieces outlining personal and institutional experiences and did not make use of research methodologies nor theory. Thematically, thirteen key considerations were identified including reasons for establishment; location choices; leadership and governance; costs and funding; partnerships; staffing; student numbers; student recruitment; curriculum design and implementation; clinical training sites; buildings and facilities; information and technology resources; and accreditation. Significant gaps in the literature included how to obtain the initial permission from governing authorities and the personal costs and burnout experienced by founding leaders and staff. Although, the literature on new medical school establishment is empirically and theoretically under-developed, it is still useful and reveals a number of important considerations that could assist founding leaders and teams to maximise the outcomes and impact of their establishment efforts. Critically, the evidence-base underpinning this complex undertaking needs to be better informed by theory and research.

Drawing on Basic Psychological Needs Theory, consultants’ supervision styles are likely to affect junior doctors’ intrinsic motivation differently in terms of psychological need frustration and psychological need satisfaction. To examine the effects of (de)motivating supervision styles, we conducted two experimental vignette studies among junior doctors. In Study 1 (N = 150, 73.3% female), we used a 2 (need support: high vs. low) x 2 (directiveness: high vs. low) between-subjects design and, in Study 2, a within-subjects design with the same factors (N = 46, 71.7% female). Both studies revealed a consistent positive effect of need-supportive supervision styles on psychological need satisfaction (+), need frustration (-), and intrinsic motivation (+). Particularly in Study 2, the main effect of need-supportive styles was strengthened by supervisor’s directiveness. Moreover, in both studies, the effects of supervision styles on intrinsic motivation were explained through psychological need frustration and psychological need satisfaction. We discuss the implications of these findings for postgraduate clinical training. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196848020"

There is evidence that disadvantaged or stigmatized groups are particularly affected. These problems not only impact students after graduation but may also have detrimental effects on patient outcomes. Resilience, conceptualized as the process of adapting well in the face of adversity, has inspired an increasing number of interventions aimed at addressing those problems in HPS. These interventions have mostly targeted individual students and their psychological traits while ignoring social and structural factors that may enhance or undermine individual resilience. To address this gap in the literature, the authors reviewed the evidence for psychosocial determinants of resilience and proposed a model inspired by the social determinants of health literature and the “upstream–downstream” metaphor. In this theoretical paper, the authors propose that upstream determinants such adverse childhood experiences and socioeconomic and sociodemographic markers of disadvantage have a direct effect on psychological adjustment and an indirect effect mediated by resilience. Additionally, the authors propose that the institutional downstream drivers of learning environment, social support, and sense of belonging moderate the direct and indirect effects of the upstream determinants on psychological adjustment. Future research should test these hypotheses and gather evidence that may guide the development of interventions. The authors present their model as part of a comprehensive response to recent calls to action to address diversity, equity and inclusion in health professions education. © 2023, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159498603"

There is a concern over whether their preparation is aligned with the expectations of the role. This study aimed to gain a better understanding of the competencies needed for legitimate practice as junior doctors and explores their perceived preparedness for practice. A qualitative, descriptive study using focus groups was undertaken with first year internship doctors. Thirty-two junior doctors in their first year of internship took part in five focus groups. The data were analysed using a reflective thematic analysis approach with a subsequent analysis using the Legitimation Code Theory (LCT) specialisation dimension coding framework to aid interpretation. Personal attributes including adaptability, organisation and proactivity form the basis of achievement in internship. While graduates felt ready in some ways, it was not in the ways that counted. Participants felt well prepared in terms of their clinical knowledge and skills, but legitimacy came from being able to take responsibility, communicate effectively and apply knowledge confidently and efficiently to all aspects of patient care, something that they did not feel ready to do. Using LCT has revealed a shift in the basis of achievement between medical school, where individual academic performance is rewarded, and internship, where personal and social competencies are legitimised. There is a clash between what graduates feel well prepared for and the expectations and demands of the internship role, resulting in a difficult and stressful transition from student to doctor. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205930319"

Although conceptual learning models exist, information about how skilled communication develops over time is scant. This study aims to unpack this process of communication learning and to identify its facilitators. We conducted a longitudinal qualitative study employing a constructivist grounded theory approach in a General Practice training setting. Over a 6-month period, we closely monitored 8 first-year and 5 third-year trainees (n = 13) by means of clinical observations, stimulated recall interviews and audio diaries. In an iterative process of data collection and analysis, we triangulated these sources across trainees (horizontal analysis) and over time (vertical analysis) to identify how themes evolved. This analysis led us to the construction of a six-stage cyclic conceptual model during which trainees: (1) have an impactful experience; (2) become aware of own communication; (3) look for alternative communication behaviours; (4) experiment with new behaviours; (5) evaluate the effectiveness; and (6) internalise the new communication behaviours. Additionally, conditions were found to support learning and reflection. Becoming a skilled communicator seems to require a continuous approach, with repeated practice and reflection to adapt and internalise communication in the clinical encounter. Consequently, we recommend that trainees be supported with tailored feedback to strengthen their communication repertoire. Ideally, they should be guided by supervisors who serve as coaches in a safe learning environment with regular, planned learning activities. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212252366"

Many construct self-presentations intended to appeal to medical-school admissions committees from the raw materials of work and volunteer experiences, in order to demonstrate that they will succeed in a demanding profession to which access is tightly controlled. Borrowing from the field of architecture the lens of construction ecology, which considers buildings in relation to the global effects of the resources required for their construction, we reframe medical-school admissions as a social phenomenon that has far-reaching harmful unintended consequences, not just for medicine but for the broader world. Illustrating with discussion of three common pathways to experiences that applicants widely believe will help them gain admission, we describe how the construction ecology of medical school admissions can recast privilege as merit, reinforce colonizing narratives, and lead to exploitation of people who are already disadvantaged. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149758341"

Intentional student leadership development is needed in health professional education programs. Student-led experiences such as student-run clinics and interprofessional training wards, are practice-based learning opportunities where learners provide leadership to clinical services and/or address a gap in the system. Given the absence of leadership definitions and concepts, this scoping review explored how student leadership is conceptualized and developed in student-led experiences. The review was conducted in accordance with best practices in scoping review methodology within the scope of relevant practice-based student-led experiences for health professional students. The research team screened 4659 abstracts, identified 315 articles for full-text review and selected 75 articles for data extraction and analysis. A thematic analysis produced themes related to leadership concepts/theories/models, objectives, facilitation/supervision, assessment and evaluation of curriculum. While responding to system gaps within health professional care, student-led experiences need to align explicit leadership theory/concepts/models with curricular objectives, pedagogy, and assessments to support health professional education. To support future student-led experiences, authors mapped five leadership student role profiles that were associated with student-led models and could be constructively aligned with theory and concepts. In addition to leveraging a student workforce to address system needs, student-led experiences must also be a force for learning through a reciprocal model of leadership and service to develop future health professionals and leaders. © The Author(s) 2024.","Review","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207685922"

Two different types of SJTs can be distinguished: Traditional SJTs, which measure general effective behavior, and construct-driven SJTs which are designed to measure specific constructs. To date, there has been no comparison of the predictive validity of these two types of SJTs in medical admission. With the present research, we examine whether the HAM-SJT, a traditional SJT, and the CD-SJT, a construct-driven SJT with an agentic and a communal scale, administered during undergraduate medical admission can predict OSCE (i.e., objective structured clinical examination) performance in a low-stakes (nLS = 159) and a high-stakes (nHS = 160) sample of medical students. Results showed a moderate positive relation between the communal scale of the CD-SJT and performance in OSCE stations with trained patients in the high-stakes sample (r =.20, p =.009). This SJT had also an incremental value in predicting the OSCE performance above and beyond GPA (i.e., grade point average), a science test (i.e., HAM-Nat), and gender (ß = 0.18, 95% CI [0.03; 0.33], p =.020). That is, individuals who chose more communal behavioral responses in the SJT were rated more favorably in interactions with trained patients in the OSCE. A comparable correlation coefficient was observed for the HAM-SJT when controlling for range restriction due to admission (rraw = 0.14 vs. rcontrolled = 0.20). Our research provides a first indication for the predictive validity of construct-driven SJTs in high-stakes undergraduate medical admission. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205374973"

Studies exploring relationships between achievement in the basic sciences and subsequent achievement in the clinical sciences generally suggest a significant positive relationship. Basic science knowledge and clinical experience are theorized to combine to form encapsulated knowledge– a dynamic mix of information that is useful for solving clinical problems. This study explores the relationship between basic science knowledge (BSK), clinical science knowledge (CSK), and clinical problem-solving ability, as measured within the context of four veterinary colleges using both college-specific measures and professionally validated, standardized measures of basic and clinical science knowledge and problem-solving ability. Significant correlations existed among all variables. Structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis were used to produce models showing that newly acquired BSK directly and significantly predicted BSK retained over time and newly acquired CSK, as well as indirectly predicted clinical problem-solving ability (mediated by newly acquired CSK and BSK retained over time). These findings likely suggest a gradual development of schema (encapsulated knowledge) and not an isolated development of biomedical versus clinical knowledge over time. A broader implication of these results is that explicitly teaching basic science knowledge positively and durably affects subsequent clinical knowledge and problem-solving ability independent of instructional strategy or curricular approach. Furthermore, for veterinary colleges specifically, student performance as measured by both course-level and standardized tests are likely to prove useful for predicting subsequent academic achievement in classroom and clinical settings, licensing examination performance, and/or for identifying students likely in need of remediation in clinical knowledge. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193386583"

The gap between basic sciences and clinical practice persists as a challenge, with traditional teaching methods yet to effectively bridge it. Concept maps (CMs), visual tools for organizing and connecting knowledge, hold promise for enhancing clinical reasoning in the undergraduate medical curriculum. However, further research is required to ascertain if CMs facilitate clinical reasoning development in medical students transitioning from basic sciences to clinical practice. This study aims to delineate how CMs can facilitate clinical reasoning in patients with multimorbidity within undergraduate Family Medicine curricula, as perceived by students and tutors, and to understand the implementation process and resources required. This exploratory qualitative study formed a part of an action research project. While introducing an educational intervention to 5th-year medical students, we conducted a qualitative evaluation. Subsequently, semi-structured group interviews were conducted with students, and a focus group was conducted with tutors. Three main educational impacts were identified: integration of clinical information, support for patient management and care plan, and collaborative learning. Key aspects for successful CM implementation included clear instructions for map construction, using user-friendly software, allocating sufficient time for the task, encouraging group discussion of CMs, and incorporating tutor feedback. CMs are pedagogical tools that facilitate clinical information integration and support management and treatment plans, helping students better understand multimorbidity patients and promoting some components of clinical reasoning in undergraduate medical education. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196738722"

A pragmatic constructivist case study approach using mixed methods was adopted. Semi-structured interviews completed with key informants underwent thematic analysis. Survey results outlining attendees’ perspectives underwent cluster and factor analysis. Stakeholder interviews (n = 13) suggested attendees could be grouped by motivations predictable from level of specialisation in a field and past engagement with conferences. From n = 1229 returned questionnaires, motivations were clustered into three factors: learning, personal and social. Three groups of attendees were identified. Group 1 (n = 500; 40.7%) was motivated by all factors. Group 2 (n = 345; 28.1%) was mainly motivated by the learning factor. Group 3 (n = 188; 15.3%) scored the social factor highest for in-person conferences and the learning factor highest for virtual meetings. All three groups expressed a preference for hybrid conferences in the future. This study indicates that medical conference attendees can be clustered based on their learning, personal and social motivations for attendance. The taxonomy enables organizers to tailor conference formats with guidance on how to utilize hybrid conferences, thereby enabling better catering to attendees’ desires for knowledge gain relative to networking. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153954777"

Their assessment practice has significant consequences for students’ learning and the patients and communities that graduates will serve. Interventions to enhance assessment must involve these assessors, yet little is known about factors influencing their assessment practice. The purpose of this study was to explore factors that influence assessment practice of clerkship convenors in three varied low-and-middle income contexts in the global South. Taking assessment practice as a behaviour, Health Behaviour Theory (HBT) was deployed as a theoretical framework to explore, describe and explain assessor behaviour. Thirty-one clinician-educators responsible for designing and implementing high-stakes clerkship assessment were interviewed in South Africa and Mexico. Interacting personal and contextual factors influencing clinician-educator assessment intention and action were identified. These included attitude, influenced by impact and response appraisal, and perceived self-efficacy; along with interpersonal, physical and organisational, and distal contextual factors. Personal competencies and conducive environments supported intention to action transition. While previous research has typically explored factors in isolation, the HBT framing enabled a systematic and coherent account of assessor behaviour. These findings add a particular contextual perspective to understanding assessment practice, yet also resonate with and extend existing work that predominantly emanates from high-income contexts in the global North. These findings provide a foundation for the planning of assessment change initiatives, such as targeted, multi-factorial faculty development. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194826869"

In medicine, given the social accountability to ensure that teaching and learning gives way to a health human resource that is willing and able to provide the healthcare that patients and communities need, it is of critical importance to generate evidence regarding this causal relationship. One question that medical education scholars ask regularly is the degree to which the unique features of training programs and learning environments impact trainee achievement of the intended learning outcomes. To date, this evidence has been difficult to generate because data pertaining to learners is only rarely systematically brought together across institutions or periods of training. We describe new research which leverages an inter-institutional data-driven approach to investigate the influence of school-level factors on the licensing outcomes of medical students. Specifically, we bring together sociodemographic, admissions, and in-training assessment variables pertaining to medical trainee graduates at each of the six medical schools in Ontario, Canada into multilevel stepwise regression models that determine the degree of association between these variables and graduate performances on the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examinations (Part 1, n = 1097 observations; Part 2, n = 616 observations), established predictors of downstream physician performance. As part of this analysis, we include an anonymized school-level (School 1, School 2) independent variable in each of these models. Our results demonstrate that the largest variable associated with performance on both the first and second parts of the licensing examinations is prior academic achievement, notably clerkship performance. Ratings of biomedical knowledge were also significantly associated with the first examination, while clerkship OSCE scores and enrollment in a family medicine residency were significantly associated with the Part 2. Small significant school effects were realized in both models accounting for 4% and 2% of the variance realized in the first and second examinations, respectively. These findings highlight that school enrollment plays a minor role relative to individual student performance in influencing examination outcomes. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211335171"

Physicians’ orientation toward lifelong learning is of crucial importance. This study aimed to explore the effects of job characteristics on physicians’ lifelong learning. A multicenter study collecting data from physicians from three medical centers in Taiwan was performed. A total of 321 physicians were surveyed with the Chinese version of the Job Content Questionnaire (C-JCQ) and the revised Jefferson Scale of Physician Lifelong Learning (JeffSPLL) to assess their job characteristics (i.e., job demands, job control, social support) and orientation toward lifelong learning. Exploratory factor analysis was employed to validate both questionnaires. Hierarchical regression was utilized to explore the relationship of job characteristics and predictors with physicians’ lifelong learning. The results revealed that job demands (β = 0.10), job control (β = 0.19), social support from supervisors (β = 0.16), the interaction of job demands × job control (β = − 0.11) and the interaction of job demands × social support from colleagues (β = 0.13) were significantly (p <.05, p <.001) related to lifelong learning. Moreover, physicians in the active group (high demand, high control) possessed a stronger orientation toward lifelong learning (mean = 3.57) than those in the low-strain group (mean = 3.42), high-strain group (mean = 3.39) and passive group (mean = 3.20). In conclusion, examining physicians’ job demands, job control and social support helps us to understand their orientation toward lifelong learning and may provide insight to improve educational strategies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146930877"

It is a new but rapidly evolving research area where cognitive and psychometric theory are combined into digital framework. However, assessment of the item quality, usability and validity of AIG relative to traditional item development methods lacks clarification. This paper takes a top-down strong theory approach to evaluate AIG in medical education. Two studies were conducted: Study I—participants with different levels of clinical knowledge and item writing experience developed medical test items both manually and through AIG. Both item types were compared in terms of quality and usability (efficiency and learnability); Study II—Automatically generated items were included in a summative exam in the content area of surgery. A psychometric analysis based on Item Response Theory inspected the validity and quality of the AIG-items. Items generated by AIG presented quality, evidences of validity and were adequate for testing student’s knowledge. The time spent developing the contents for item generation (cognitive models) and the number of items generated did not vary considering the participants' item writing experience or clinical knowledge. AIG produces numerous high-quality items in a fast, economical and easy to learn process, even for inexperienced and without clinical training item writers. Medical schools may benefit from a substantial improvement in cost-efficiency in developing test items by using AIG. Item writing flaws can be significantly reduced thanks to the application of AIG's models, thus generating test items capable of accurately gauging students' knowledge. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153363446"

Critical social perspectives are increasingly influencing the examination of professional identity formation within healthcare professions. While understanding how disabled students and practitioners integrate a disability identity into their professional identity is crucial, we have limited knowledge about the actual formation of their professional identity. This study aims to investigate how disabled students and clinicians in healthcare professions actively shape their professional identity during their educational and professional journeys. We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 27 students and 29 clinicians, conducting up to three interviews per participant over a year, resulting in 124 interviews. Participants represented five healthcare professions: medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and social work. Employing a constructivist grounded theory approach, our data analysis revealed two prominent dimensions: (a) The contextualization of identity formation processes and (b) The identity navigation dimension in which the professional identity and disability identity are explored. This emerging model sheds light on the dynamic processes involved in identity formation, emphasizing the significance of a supportive environment for disabled students and practitioners. Such an environment fosters the negotiation of both professional and disability identities. Moreover, this study recognizes the importance of a re-examination of the concepts of professionalism and professional identity in healthcare professions. In conclusion, this research underscores the importance of understanding and supporting the multifaceted identity formation processes among disabled individuals within healthcare professions. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208479151"

Furthermore, the rapidly evolving field of healthcare has meant that there is greater emphasis within tertiary education for students to become self-directed learners and possess the skills to engage in life-long learning. The aim of this scoping review was to explore the drivers that improve the student learning experience, in undergraduate clinical science programs that utilise self-directed learning. The Joanna Briggs Institute Scoping Review Methodology guided this study. The electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, Scopus and ERIC were comprehensively searched in April 2022 and re-run August 2023, for peer-reviewed research articles published in English. The original search was developed in MEDLINE and then adapted to each database. Following the Joanna Briggs Scoping Review methodology, articles were screened first by title and abstract and then by full text. Included articles were assessment for methodological quality. The search strategy yielded 2209 articles for screening. 19 met the inclusion criteria. Five key factors were identified which improve the student learning experience in self-directed learning: (i) curricular elements; (ii) educator influence; (iii) impact of peers, (iv) environment; and (v) clinical placement experiences. There are many curricular, environmental, and external factors which can improve the student learning experience in programs that utilise self-directed learning. Greater understanding of these factors will allow educators within clinical science programs to implement self-directed learning strategies more effectively within curriculum. © The Author(s) 2024.","Review","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207228373"

Rural physicians are expected to have similar underrepresented aspects as minority physicians because of their specific sociocultural contexts and consequent private–professional intersection, which lead to ethical complexities. Therefore, to bridge this research gap, we interviewed 12 early- to mid-career Japanese physicians working in rural areas and explored their experiences. Through a narrative analysis guided by Figured Worlds theory, we analysed the data by focusing on the vocabulary, expressions, and metaphors participants used to describe their experiences. A central theme emerged concerning how the rural physicians configurated their personal versus professional participation in their local communities. Further, their identity narratives varied regarding how they constructed their identities, rural communities, and relationships as well as their identity formation ideals and strategies to achieve them. Informed by ‘Big Questions’ concerning worldview framework, we delineated four identity narratives as prototypes to describe how they participated in their communities. These identity narratives provide a preliminary understanding of how diverse identity formation is for rural physicians. In addition, our findings exposed the current professional identity formation framework as potentially biased towards single forms of participation in monolithic communities, overlooking complicated forms of participation in multiple communities. We argue that applying frameworks and concepts to capture these multiple forms of participation as well as revisiting the ‘discourse of integration’ are necessary steps to overcome the limitation of the current understanding of professional identity formation. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192796114"

Using collective online interviews, collaborative autoethnography (CAE) was employed to generate data comprising educator’s reflective accounts of teaching QM in medical schools across two continents. Three main themes were identified through collaborative thematic analysis: making meaningful contributions from a marginalized position; finding our pedagogical feet; and recognizing the translational applicability and value of QR. We reflected on the marginalized positioning of QM in medical curricula and the underestimation of the value of QR to understanding pressing health issues. Analysis of these reflections pointed to a lack of formal training for educators and curriculum space for qualitative approaches. Our teaching pedagogies, developed through our own research experiences, self-reflection and student feedback, were primarily student-centered employing a range of novel approaches designed to foster skills and interest in the craft of QR, and introduce a greater appreciation of the significance of QR approaches to medicine. CAE further allowed us to identify some key recommendations that could help medical educators plan for teaching QM and other research methods more effectively in medicine. Future curriculum development should consider the benefits of exposing learners to a range of methods and approaches from across the qualitative-quantitative spectrum. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153767348"

Whether residents learn from communication training with actors depends on whether they are able to select appropriate information or ‘predictive cues’ from that learning situation that accurately reflect their or their peers’ performance and whether they use those cues for ensuing judgement. This study aimed to explore whether prompts can help medical residents improving use of predictive cues and judgement of communication skills. First and third year Kenyan residents (N = 41) from 8 different specialties were randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups during a mock OSCE assessing advanced communication skills. Residents in the intervention arm received paper predictive cue prompts while residents in the control arm received paper regular prompts for self-judgement. In a pre- and post- test, residents’ use of predictive cues and the appropriateness of peer-judgements were evaluated against a pre-rated video of another resident. The intervention improved both the use of predictive cues in self-judgement and peer-judgement. Ensuing accuracy of peer-judgements in the pre- to post-test only partly improved: no effect from the intervention was found on overall appropriateness of judgements. However, when analyzing participants’ completeness of judgements over the various themes within the consultation, a reduction in inappropriate judgments scores was seen in the intervention group. In conclusion, predictive cue prompts can help learners to concentrate on relevant cues when evaluating communication skills and partly improve monitoring accuracy. Future research should focus on offering prompts more frequently to evaluate whether this increases the effect on monitoring accuracy in communication skills. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203146860"

Here, we use data from thirty UK medical schools to describe the benefits of Rasch modelling in quality assurance and the barriers to using it. Sixty “common content” multiple choice items were offered to all UK medical schools in 2016-17, and a further sixty in 2017-18, with five available in both years. Thirty medical schools participated, for sixty total datasets across two sessions, and 14,342 individual sittings. Schools selected items to embed in written assessment near the end of their programmes. We applied Rasch modelling to evaluate unidimensionality, model fit statistics and item quality, horizontal equating to compare performance across schools, and vertical equating to compare item performance across time. Of the sixty sittings, three provided non-unidimensional data, and eight violated goodness of fit measures. Item-level statistics identified potential improvements in item construction and provided quality assurance. Horizontal equating demonstrated large differences in scores across schools, while vertical equating showed item characteristics were stable across sessions. Rasch modelling provides significant advantages in model- and item- level reporting compared to classical approaches. However, the complexity of the analysis and the smaller number of educators familiar with Rasch must be addressed locally for a programme to benefit. Furthermore, due to the comparative novelty of Rasch modelling, there is greater ambiguity on how to proceed when a Rasch model identifies misfitting or problematic data. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197663489"

Leaders of educational programs, therefore, need to balance enabling students’ voices to be heard with maintaining teachers’ enthusiasm and commitment to teaching. Given the paucity of research to explain or guide this struggle, we explored why and how education leaders grapple with negative learner feedback received about their teachers. Using an Interpretive Description methodology, 11 education leaders participated in semi-structured interviews. Discussion was stimulated by showing participants learner narratives they had previously asked to be deleted because they perceived the narrative to be overly critical. Transcripts were iteratively analyzed as codes were developed, refined, and combined into themes. Education leaders interpreted the scope, framing, and focus of the feedback to decide whether it was overly critical. Such determinations were combined with contextual considerations such as the teacher’s personal circumstances, the learning environment and how the teacher might react to think through what potential damage the feedback might do to the teacher. Throughout the process, leaders struggled with whether protecting teachers risked not protecting learners and remained unsure about the ethics of censoring student voices. Our study offers direction regarding how to optimize feedback to teachers while minimizing risks inherent in sharing negative feedback with them. Implications include that there is value in: (1) extending feedback interpretation support to teachers, education leaders and learners; (2) situating upward feedback in a coaching dialogue; and, (3) applying the same principles recommended for the provision of feedback to learners, to teachers. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202941932"

Rural clinical placements provide a rich learning environment for students to improve their competencies, self-esteem, and preparedness for practice (PFP). This scoping review aimed to identify pre-registration health students’ perspectives on rural placement regarding competency and skill development, and enablers and barriers to learning. The methodology outlined by the Joanna Briggs Institute was followed. Out of 1186 records (366 duplicates), 821 were screened by title and abstract, 59 underwent full-text screening and 18 studies were included. Over half the studies included medicine students (n = 11). Reported competencies predominantly focused on self-assessed confidence regarding clinical skills. The reported barriers and enablers to learning highlighted the complexity of the placement experience and the importance of interpersonal factors, learner engagement and the supervisor’s role. The review identified a gap in the literature pertaining to student perspectives of competencies and skills not assessed or experienced as well as a lack of standardised measures for PFP. The identified enablers and barriers provide suggestions for rural placement design and emphasise the importance of the student learning experience.

However, the exact contributions of these components of clinical reasoning to diagnostic success remain unclear. This is particularly the case when operationalizing the diagnostic process with diagnostic activities (i.e., teachable practices that generate knowledge). Therefore, we conducted a study investigating to what extent knowledge and diagnostic activities uniquely explain variance in diagnostic success with virtual patients among medical students. The sample consisted of N = 106 medical students in their third to fifth year of university studies in Germany (6-years curriculum). Participants completed professional knowledge tests before diagnosing virtual patients. Diagnostic success with the virtual patients was assessed with diagnostic accuracy as well as a comprehensive diagnostic score to answer the call for more extensive measurement of clinical reasoning outcomes. The three diagnostic activities hypothesis generation, evidence generation, and evidence evaluation were tracked. Professional knowledge predicted performance in terms of the comprehensive diagnostic score and displayed a small association with diagnostic accuracy. Diagnostic activities predicted comprehensive diagnostic score and diagnostic accuracy. Hierarchical regressions showed that the diagnostic activities made a unique contribution to diagnostic success, even when knowledge was taken into account.

Accordingly, it is in medical schools’ interest to select candidates with strong interactional abilities. While Multiple Mini Interviews (MMIs) provide a useful context to assess such abilities, the evaluation of candidate performance during MMIs is not always based on a solid theoretical framework. The newly developed selection procedure “Interactional Competencies – Medical Doctors (IC-MD)” uses an MMI circuit with five simulation patient scenarios and is rated based on the theoretically and empirically grounded construct of emotional availability. A first validation study with N = 70 first-semester medical students took place in 2021. In terms of convergent validity, IC-MD ratings showed strong correlations with simulation patients’ satisfaction with the encounter (r =.57) but no association with emotional intelligence measures. IC-MD ratings were not related to high school performance or a cognitive student aptitude test, indicating divergent validity. Inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.63) and generalizability (Eρ2 = 0.64) were satisfactory. The IC-MD proved to be fair regarding participants’ age and gender. Participants with prior work experience in healthcare outperformed those without such experience. Participant acceptance of the procedure were good. The IC-MD is a promising selection procedure capable of assessing interactional competencies relevant to the medical setting. Measures of interactional competencies can complement the use of cognitive selection criteria in medical student admission. The predictive validity of the IC-MD needs to be addressed in future studies. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198668922"

This exploratory study used a social constructivist lens to understand how health professions educators and researchers integrate knowledge from social media into their respective practices. We purposively sampled health professions educators and researchers using the hashtags #MedEd, #HPE, and #HealthProfessionsEducation on Twitter/X. We obtained informed consent, conducted interviews via videoconference, and engaged in multiple cycles of deductive and inductive coding and analysis. Participants identified as educators and researchers (n = 12), as researchers (n = 1), or as educators (n = 1) from Canada (n = 8), the United States (n = 3), and Switzerland, Ireland, and China (n = 1, respectively). Eight participants actively used social media (i.e., creating/posting original content); six participants indicated passive use (i.e., reading/retweeting content). They discussed the importance of crafting a consumable message and social media identity to streamline the content shared. Social media’s accessible, non-hierarchical nature may facilitate knowledge-sharing, whereas the potential spread of misinformation and technological requirements (e.g., internet access, country-specific restrictions on platforms) present barriers to uptake. Participants described using knowledge gained from social media as teaching tools, new research methodologies, new theoretical frameworks, and low-risk clinical interventions. Previous research has demonstrated how social media has empirically been used for diffusion or dissemination rather than as an active process of evidence uptake. Using knowledge translation frameworks, like the Knowledge to Action or Theoretical Domains frameworks, to inform social media-based knowledge sharing activities in health professions education is recommended. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193279539"

Students have to manage these emotions. Students learn and develop their professional identity formation through interactions with patients and members of the healthcare teams. Earlier studies have highlighted the issues involved with processing emotionally challenging situations, although studies concerning learning and professional identity formation in response to these experiences are rare. In this study, we explored medical students’ experiences of emotionally challenging situations in work-based learning, and the impact these experiences had on forming medical students’ professional identities. We conducted an analysis of narrative data (n = 85), using a constructivist grounded theory approach. The narratives were made up of medical students’ reflective essays at the end of their education (tenth term). The analysis showed that students’ main concern when facing emotionally challenging situations during their work-based education was the struggle to achieve and maintain a professional approach. They reported different strategies for managing their feelings and how these strategies led to diverse consequences. In the process, students also described arriving at insights into their own personal needs and shortcomings. We consider this development of self-awareness and resulting self-knowledge to be an important part of the continuously ongoing socialization process of forming a professional identity. Thus, experiencing emotionally challenging situations can be considered a unique and invaluable opportunity, as well as a catalyst for students’ development. We believe that highlighting the impact of emotions in medical education can constitute an important contribution to knowledge about the process of professional identity formation. This knowledge can enable faculty to provide students with more effective and sufficient support, facilitating their journey in becoming physicians. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159284295"

It also made visible the ways in which Asians across the globe experience racial hate and illuminated that the experiences of Asians in medicine are not often spotlighted. In the United States specifically, Asian Americans are not viewed as minoritized in medicine, yet their professional experiences are rarely highlighted. Informed by the discourses of the model minority, the forever foreigner, and ethnic lumping, we used Asian critical theory to explore how Asian American medical providers in Utah understand racial and ethnic identity and how these identities and experiences of racialization inform their professional identities. Using a case study approach, we identified and interviewed 23 physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners (during spring 2022) who live in and practice medicine in Utah. Transcribed interviews were coded using reflective thematic analysis. Findings were organized into three themes: (1) feeling different, (2) experiences with discrimination, and (3) wrestling with the model minority myth. While Asian American medical providers experience not belonging, they also have the agency to disrupt discrimination and stereotypes. Asian American medical providers’ racial and ethnic identities influence their professional interactions. Understanding the intersections of their social and professional identities are important to providing support for Asian medical providers, within the United States and beyond. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208248124"

Anti-oppression pedagogy (AOP) addresses the need for health professional learners to understand multiple health inequities and the structures and systems that produce inequities. However, the inclusion of AOP in health professions education varies and there is a lack of clarity in its conceptualization and integration. A scoping review was conducted to address this gap and to understand how AOP is conceptualized and integrated in health professions education. Thirty-six articles met the inclusion criteria. The articles demonstrated that AOP is not commonly utilized terminology within health professions education. When AOP is integrated, it is not consistently conceptualized but is generally viewed as a broad concept that focuses on antiracism; decoloniality; intersectionality; and supporting learners to understand, critically reflect on, and act against structural and systemic forms of oppressions. In addition, there is variation in the integration of AOP in health professions education with the most common methods consisting of discussions, cases, reflection, learning through lived experiences, and the incorporation of humanities within a longitudinal curriculum. The results of this scoping review highlight the need for health professions education to develop one clear concept that educators use when teaching about anti-oppression, which may reduce working in silos and allow educators to better collaborate with each other in advancing this work. In addition, this review suggests that health professional programs should consider incorporating AOP in curricula with a broad and longitudinal approach utilizing the common methods of delivery. To better support programs in including AOP in curricula, further research is required to emphasize the benefits, provide clarity on its conceptualization, and determine the most effective methods of integration. © The Author(s) 2024.","Review","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192807497"

Little is known about how different selection tools impact student diversity across programs using different combinations of traditional and broadened selection criteria. The present multi-site study examined the chances in selection of subgroups of applicants to HPE undergraduate programs with distinctive selection procedures, and their performance on corresponding selection tools. Probability of selection of subgroups (based on gender, migration background, prior education, parental education) of applicants (N = 1935) to five selection procedures of corresponding Dutch HPE undergraduate programs was estimated using multilevel logistic regression. Multilevel linear regression was used to analyze performance on four tools: prior-education grade point average (pe-GPA), biomedical knowledge test, curriculum-sampling test, and curriculum vitae (CV). First-generation Western immigrants and applicants with a foreign education background were significantly less likely to be selected than applicants without a migration background and with pre-university education. These effects did not vary across programs. More variability in effects was found between different selection tools. Compared to women, men performed significantly poorer on CVs, while they had higher scores on biomedical knowledge tests. Applicants with a non-Western migration background scored lower on curriculum-sampling tests. First-generation Western immigrants had lower CV-scores. First-generation university applicants had significantly lower pe-GPAs. There was a variety in effects for applicants with different alternative forms of prior education.

Despite their widely accepted benefits, students from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds may not experience the same learning outcomes from engaging in SBL as their local peers due to complex factors. Supporting students from CALD backgrounds in SBL is vital, not only to optimise their learning experiences and outcomes, but also ensure inclusive health professions education. While the literature on the participation of students from CALD backgrounds in SBL activities is emerging, this scoping review was conducted to (1) map the evidence on how SBL impacts the learning outcomes of health professions students from CALD backgrounds; and (2) understand how students from CALD backgrounds perceive their SBL experiences. Following Arskey and O’Malley’s framework and Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews, a search was conducted in January 2024 using PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, PsycINFO, and ERIC. Ten papers met the inclusion criteria. This review highlighted three themes: (1) diverse learning outcomes of SBL; (2) facing linguistic and cultural challenges that are inherent to SBL; and (3) preparation, reflection, and support to actively participate in SBL activities. This review indicates that SBL could enhance clinical skills and confidence in students from CALD backgrounds. However, well-designed SBL activities to meet the learning needs of students from CALD backgrounds are currently lacking and further research across broader health professions fields is needed. © The Author(s) 2024.","Review","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208497754"

However, professional and institutional cultures and structures are known to contribute to the challenges for CALD practitioners who work in dominant culture practice contexts. This scoping review used the theory of Legitimate Peripheral Participation to describe and interpret literature about the experiences of CALD health practitioners in view of informing strategies to increase their representation. A systematised search was conducted across four allied health, medicine and nursing databases. Following abstract and full text screening, articles which fit the inclusion criteria (n = 124) proceeded to data extraction. Categories relating to the experiences of practitioners were extracted, and three themes were identified that were subsequently theoretically interpreted: Discrimination, Consequences and Hierarchy. Discrimination functioned as a barrier to CALD practitioners being legitimised and able to participate equally in healthcare practice, retaining their position at the periphery of the practice community; Consequences reinforced this peripheral position and further impeded legitimation and participation; and Hierarchy was maintained through structures that reinforced and reproduced these barriers. The findings summarise how these barriers are reinforced through the intersections of professional and racial hierarchies, and highlight a need for strategies to address discrimination and structures that marginalise CALD practitioners’ identity, practices and participation in their health professional communities. © The Author(s) 2024.","Review","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199271307"

Q, as it is most often referred to, is an appropriate methodology whenever a researcher is interested in uncovering and describing the multiple divergent viewpoints on any topic. Such discovery of viewpoints provides insight into the subjectivities related to policies, values, priorities, judgements, opinions, and decisions. The disciplines where Q has been used for research are many, and include health sciences, education, and other social science / behavioral science fields. Because of its rather idiosyncratic place in research, however, many Q methodologists are self-taught or seek education through a few select universities that offer graduate level Q courses. The key to successfully approaching a Q study is to embrace its unique approach to studying subjectivity such that it is a powerful tool in health science education and other fields. It is common to find inconsistencies related to Q terminology, analyses, and decision making across studies. There is often an over reliance on concepts that come from purely quantitative methodologies such as R factor analysis rather than embracing the qualitative-quantitative hybridity of Q. This article is written as a primer with a focus on understanding Q at a deeper level rather than a step-by-step guide. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153094057"

The critical first step in employing Kane’s approach is to specify the interpretation-use argument (IUA). However, in the HPE literature, this step is often poorly articulated. This article provides guidance on developing the IUA using a worked example involving a workplace performance assessment tool. In developing the IUA, we have drawn inspiration from approaches used in the discipline of language assessment to situate the inferences, warrants and assumptions in the context of the assessment tool. The worked example makes use of Toulmin’s model of informal logic/argumentation as a framework to structure the IUA and presents Toulmin diagrams for each inference such that the reader can connect the argument chain together. We also present several lessons learned so the reader can understand the issues we grappled with in developing the IUA. A well laid out IUA allows the argument to be critiqued by others and provides a framework to guide collection of validity evidence, and therefore is an essential ingredient in the work of assessment design and validation. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210412821"

Interprofessional education (IPE) is a prerequisite for IPC and influences learners’ attitudes, knowledge, and collaboration skills. Since attitudes shape behavior, understanding how they are formed is crucial for influencing IPC in learners’ professional practice. We investigated what kind of IPE works, for which students, how, and in what circumstances to develop positive attitudes towards IPC. Using realist synthesis, we extracted causal mechanisms that produce positive attitude outcomes and the conducive contexts that trigger them. Our analysis resulted in six plausible context-mechanism-outcome configurations that explain positive attitude development. Positive IPC attitudes are more likely to arise in contexts where IPE provides time and facilities for formal and informal interactions, as this allows learners to get to know each other both professionally and personally, fostering trust, respect, and mutual liking. Additionally, positive attitudes are more likely in contexts where the IPE curriculum is perceived as career-relevant and boosts confidence. Key mechanisms of positive attitude development include getting to know the other learners professionally and personally, experiencing positive affect during IPE, and learners experiencing mutual dependence. Sustained positive attitudes are more likely to develop when there is organizational support for IPC and professionals attend IPE on an ongoing basis, allowing the attitudes and values expected in IPC to be positively reinforced and eventually integrated into the learners’ personal value system. © The Author(s) 2024.","Review","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204596197"

Given the positive impact of PCK on enhancing professional knowledge for effective teaching, this study investigates the learning process of health professions educators in developing their PCK through a faculty development initiative, supported by the Content Representation (CoRe) tool. Using a qualitative approach, grounded in social constructionism, the study engaged eight educators from diverse health disciplines at an Australian university. Participants collaborated in developing and refining PCK-infused lesson plans using the CoRe tool. Several workshops, writing sessions, feedback sharing, and an online community of practice facilitated PCK-related discussion, resource sharing, and networking. Data collection comprised two rounds of individual interviews, written reflections, and lesson planning artefacts. Data were analysed using team-based thematic framework analysis. Four themes were identified: 1) articulating teaching purposes, (2) understanding students’ learning needs, (3) promoting reflection on teaching practice, and (4) challenges in adapting and implementing the CoRe tool. The findings highlight the critical role of faculty development programs and advocate for the use of the CoRe tool for articulating and scaffolding PCK for both experienced and novice educators. The collaborative environment facilitated peer feedback and knowledge sharing, thus fostering a collective understanding of PCK and affirming its relevance within the broader health professions education community. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212408504"

It is unclear, however; how competencies of AHCP as defined by individual health professions relate to these pillars. Addressing this knowledge gap will help to facilitate the operationalization of AHCP as a concept and help inform educational curricula. To identify existing competencies across AHCP literature and examine how they relate to the four pillars of a multi-professional AHCP framework. An umbrella review was conducted in accordance with JBI methodology. The electronic search for published and grey literature was completed using CINAHL, Scopus, Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), ERIC (OVID) and Google. Secondary reviews and research syntheses of master level AHCP programs published after 1990 in either English or French were considered for inclusion and results were analyzed using a directed content analysis. Seventeen publications detailing 620 individual competencies were included. AHCP competencies were described across four professions and 22 countries, with many publications related to nursing and AHCP in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. Many retrieved competencies were found to map to the four pillars of AHCP, although clinical practice and leadership and management pillars were addressed more often. Competencies of AHCP are generally consistent with the four pillars. However, the distribution of competencies is unequal across pillars, professions, and geographical regions, which may provide direction for further research.

As such it is important to map and analyze the current literature on educational initiatives that teach about historical and ongoing colonialism as a determinant of health to identify commonly used theoretical frameworks and outcomes assessed, as well as the intended and unintended short- and long-term outcomes on health professional learner’s beliefs, attitudes and behaviours. This scoping review follows the framework by (Peters et al., JBI Evidence Synthesis 18:2119–2126, 2020). Six databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsychInfo, Sociological Abstracts, ERIC, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses) were searched with grey literature included through hand-searching of Indigenous journals and citation searching for papers published up until 2022 based on an established search criterion. Two reviewers independently screened articles. In total, 2731 records were identified and screened; full text was assessed for 72 articles; 14 articles were identified as meeting all the inclusion criteria and included in the final review. Commonly- used theoretical frameworks were transformative learning and cultural safety, with a variety of evaluation tools used and post-intervention outcomes measured across the studies (e.g., knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, behaviour and general learner feedback). Indigenous education interventions require longitudinal evaluation studies to address shortcomings in the design and evaluation of outcomes associated with teaching about colonialism as a structural determinant of health. It is critical that we identify and monitor the intended and unintended consequences of such curriculum as we look to develop solutions to changing health professional learners’ false beliefs and attitudes, in hopes to inform their future care practices. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153104959"

Unrelieved tensions about the concept persist within the health professions education (HPE) literature owing to reflection’s diverse theoretical history. Tensions extend from the most basic, e.g., what is reflection and what are its contents, to the complex, e.g., how is reflection performed and whether it should be evaluated. Nonetheless, reflection is generally seen as vital to HPE, because it imparts crucial strategies and awareness to learners in their professional practices. In this article, we explore both conceptual and pedagogical dimensions of teaching for reflection. We address the concept of reflection, its application to practice, and how to remain faithful to transformative, critical pedagogy when teaching for it. We present (a) an analysis of two theories of education in HPE: Transformative Learning and Vygotskian Cultural Historical Theory. We (b) outline a pedagogical approach that applies Piotr Gal’perin’s SCOBA: schema for the complete orienting basis of an action.

The influence of their assessment practice in university-run licensure exams on student learning has direct implications for future patient care. While teaching practice has been shown to parallel conceptions of teaching, we know too little about conceptions of assessment in medical education to know if this is the case for assessment practice and conceptions of assessment. To explore clinician-educators’ conceptions of assessment, a phenomenographic study was undertaken. Phenomenography explores conceptions, the qualitatively different ways of understanding a phenomenon. Data analysis identifies a range of hierarchically inclusive categories of understanding, from simple to more complex, and the dimensions that distinguish each category or conception. Thirty-one clerkship convenors in three diverse Southern settings were interviewed in three cycles of iterative data collection and analysis. Four conceptions of assessment were identified: passive operator, awakening enquirer, active owner and scholarly assessor. Six dimensions were elucidated to describe and distinguish each conception: purpose of assessment; temporal perspective; role and responsibility; accountability; reflexivity and emotional valence. Additionally, three characteristics that appeared to track the progressive nature of the conceptions were identified: professional identity, assessment literacy and self-efficacy. These conceptions encompass and extend previously described conceptions across different educational levels, disciplines and contexts, suggesting applicability to other settings. There is some evidence of a relationship between conceptions and practice, suggesting, together with the hierarchical nature of these conceptions, that targeting conceptions during faculty development may be an effective approach to enhance assessment practice. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146587129"

An understanding of the role of language in successful completion of program requirements was needed to effectively support students’ education. The study objectives were to identify the role of linguistic factors in students’ academic and clinical performance and to provide recommendations for strategies to address areas of learning difficulty. A multimethod approach used 4 data sources: (1) Multiple Mini Interview (MMI) informal language assessment scores, (2) grade point average (GPA), (3) fieldwork evaluation reports, and (4) an online survey of program graduates. The GPA on admission and MMI scores of 140 students predicted respectively only 20% and 2% of the variation in GPA on program completion. The areas of poorest performance in failed clinical fieldwork reports were in clinical reasoning and communication competencies. Among survey respondents (n = 47), 44.5% reported that a clinical placement in their second language with related charting (51.6%) and client communication (40.9%) were the most significant difficulties encountered in the program. Clients with mental health issues (45.4%) were the most challenging population to work with, attributed to communication barriers in the students’ second language. Strategies are proposed to support occupational therapy students’ academic and clinical language proficiency, including conversational training courses, problem-based learning activities in students’ second language, focussed teaching on the clinical reasoning process and reflective skills, and language coaching to address early signs of difficulty in clinical fieldwork. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160267072"

Health professional educators have been called to address such disparities within healthcare, policy, and practice. To tackle structural racism within healthcare, one avenue that has emerged is the creation of medical education interventions within postgraduate residency medical programming. The objective of this scoping review is to examine the current literature on anti-racist educational interventions, that integrate a systemic or structural view of racism, within postgraduate medical education. Through the identification and analysis of 23 papers, this review identified three major components of interest across medical interventions, including (a) conceptualization, (b) pedagogical issues, and (c) outcomes & evaluation. There were overlapping points of discussion and analysis within each of these components. Conceptualization addressed how researchers conceptualized racism in different ways, the range of curricular content educators chose to challenge racism, and the absence of community’s role in curricular development. Pedagogical issues addressed knowledge vs. skills-based teaching, and tensions between one-time workshops and integrative curriculum. Outcomes and evaluation highlighted self-reported Likert scales as dominant types of evaluation, self-evaluation in educational interventions, and misalignments between intervention outcomes and learning objectives. The findings are unique in their in-depth exploration of anti-racist medical interventions within postgraduate medical education programming, specifically in relation to efforts to address systemic and structural racism. The findings contribute a meaningful review of the current state of the field of medical education and generate new conversations about future possibilities for a broader anti-racist health professions curriculum. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195864221"

Multiple raters used a high-inference categorical scheme on 36 sessions. Our research questions concern the types of student mistakes, clinical teachers’ reactions to them and if they use different strategies to address different types of mistakes. We used a Poisson model and generalized mixed models to analyse these research questions. Most frequently, students made reproduction mistakes. Relatively high rates of rejection and a similar prevalence of low and high levels of elaboration and correction time for students were observed. Reproduction mistakes were associated with the highest level of rejection and the lowest level of elaboration. High levels of elaboration were observed when students were applying skills in new situations. Students were most often allowed time to correct when mistakes in the areas of analysis or application of skills and knowledge had occurred. There is a decrease in the rate of making mistakes for neurology and orthopaedics compared to internal medicine. Reproduction mistakes influence significantly the outcome feedback compared to application mistakes. Analytic and reproduction mistakes influence elaboration significantly compared to application mistakes. We found a significant effect whether the lecturer allows time for correction of reproduction mistakes compared to application mistakes. These results contribute to the understanding of interactive, patient-centred clinical teaching as well as student mistakes and how teachers are reacting to them. Our descriptive findings provide an empirical basis for clinical teachers to react to student mistakes in didactically fruitful ways. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159274309"

This study aimed to examine whether patient skin colour can affect the diagnostic ability and confidence of medical students, and their cognitive reasoning processes. We presented students with 12 different clinical presentations on both white skin (WS) and non-white skin (NWS). A think aloud (TA) study was conducted to explore students’ cognitive reasoning processes (n = 8). An online quiz was also conducted where students submitted a diagnosis and confidence level for each clinical presentation (n = 185). In the TA interviews, students used similar levels of information gathering and analytical reasoning for each skin type but appeared to display increased uncertainty and reduced non-analytical reasoning methods for the NWS images compared to the WS images. In the online quiz, students were significantly more likely to accurately diagnose five of the 12 clinical presentations (shingles, cellulitis, Lyme disease, eczema and meningococcal disease) on WS compared to NWS (p < 0.01). With regards to students’ confidence, they were significantly more confident diagnosing eight of the 12 clinical presentations (shingles, cellulitis, Lyme disease, eczema, meningococcal disease, urticaria, chickenpox and Kawasaki disease) on WS when compared to NWS (p < 0.01). These findings highlight the need to improve teaching resources to include a greater diversity of skin colours exhibiting clinical signs, to improve students’ knowledge and confidence, and ultimately, to avoid patients being misdiagnosed due to the colour of their skin. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149004651"

Educational escape rooms cultivate valuable skills such as teamwork, communication, creativity, attention to detail, and the ability to apply knowledge under time pressures. While several studies have independently assessed learners’ knowledge gains after educational escape room interventions, the present work meta-analyzes the efficacy of educational escape rooms across studies and student learners within health sciences education. A systematic search across seven databases was performed by a health sciences librarian from inception to March 24, 2023. Record screenings, full-text reviews, and data extractions were managed within Covidence. MERSQI criteria were used to assess study quality. Pooled effect sizes (Standardized Mean Differences = SMD) were estimated through meta-analysis to summarize learner performance outcomes after educational escape room interventions. Eleven studies followed a longitudinal pretest–posttest design, and five studies followed a control-treatment group design. Learners’ posttest scores after participating in an educational escape room were statistically higher than their pretest scores as indicated by a large positive summary effect size (SMD ≥ 0.893; p <0.001). Educational escape rooms were also effective for treatment group participants (n = 508), who significantly outperformed (SMD = 0.616; p <0.001) control group participants (n = 555). Most escape rooms were employed as a mechanism for reviewing educational content. This meta-analytic review suggests escape rooms are effective educational interventions for increasing knowledge gains among health sciences learners and highlights common implementation practices to help guide educators interested in this game-based learning approach. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Review","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203698719"

As the field’s understanding of the process of therapeutic reasoning is less well understood, we focused on studies that collected data on the process of therapeutic reasoning. To synthesize previous studies of therapeutic reasoning characteristics, methodological approaches, theoretical underpinnings, and results. We conducted a scoping review with systematic searching for English language articles with no date limits. Databases included MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, Scopus, Embase, Proquest Dissertations and Theses Global, and ERIC. Search terms captured therapeutic reasoning in health professions education research. Initial search yielded 5450 articles. The title and abstract screening yielded 180 articles. After full-text review, 87 studies were included in this review. Articles were excluded if they were outside health professions education, did not collect data on the process of therapeutic reasoning, were not empirical studies, or not focused on therapeutic reasoning. We analyzed the included articles according to scoping questions using qualitative content analysis. 87 articles dated from 1987 to 2019 were included. Several study designs were employed including think-aloud protocol, interview and written documentation. More than half of the articles analyzed the data using qualitative coding. Authors often utilized several middle-range theories to explain therapeutic reasoning processes. The hypothetico-deductive model was most frequently mentioned. The included articles rarely built off the results from previous studies. Six key result categories were found: identifying themes, characterizing and testing previous local theory, exploring factors, developing new local theory, testing tools, and testing hypothesis. Despite the cast body of therapeutic reasoning research, individual study results remain isolated from previous studies.

Objectives: To conduct a critical analysis of the literature on interprofessional student led clinics, and the views of stakeholders on feasibility and the barriers and facilitators to implementation. Design: A scoping review, evidence synthesis and quality appraisal were conducted using PRISMA Scr. Eight databases were searched from 2003 to 2023: Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), Cochrane, Scopus, ERIC, Web of Science and Informit Health Collection. A qualitative descriptive approach was used to analyse data from patients, students and educators and inductive thematic analysis identified emergent themes. Results: Forty-six studies were included from a yield of 3140 publications. A key theme to emerge was that patients perceived improvements in their health and wellbeing and valued gaining health information from student led clinics. Student experiences were mostly positive although some found it challenging to work in interprofessional teams and roles were not always clear. The clinics enabled students to improve communication skills and autonomy. Clinical educators reported that students benefited from experiential learning within an interprofessional context. The clinics were feasible, provided that sufficient funding, infrastructure, staff and resources were available. Barriers to implementation included lack of funding, excessive waiting times and non-aligned student timetables. Pre-clinic orientation and support from on-site clinical educators facilitated implementation. Conclusions: Despite some challenges with implementing interprofessional student led clinics, they can have a positive impact on student learning and patient experiences. © Crown 2024.","Review","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195264006"

Through five specific examples (pixels, driving lesson/test, jury deliberations, signal processing, and assessment as a toolbox), we interrogate how metaphors are being used in assessment to consider what value they add to understanding and implementation of assessment practices. By unpacking these metaphors in action, we probe each metaphor’s rationale and function, the gains each metaphor makes, and explore the unintended meanings they may carry. In summarizing common uses of metaphors, we elucidate how there may be both advantages and/or disadvantages. Metaphors can play important roles in simplifying, complexifying, communicating, translating, encouraging reflection, and convincing. They may be powerfully rhetorical, leading to intended consequences, actions, and other pragmatic outcomes. Although metaphors can be extremely helpful, they do not constitute thorough critique, justified evidence or argumentation. We argue that although metaphors have utility, they must be carefully considered if they are to serve assessment needs in intended ways. We should pay attention to how metaphors may be misinterpreted, what they ignore or unintentionally signal, and perhaps mitigate against this with anticipated corrections or nuanced qualifications. Failure to do so may lead to implementing practices that miss underlying and relevant complexities for assessment science and practice. Using metaphors requires careful attention with respect to their role, contributions, benefits and limitations. We highlight the value that comes from critiquing metaphors, and demonstrate the care required to ensure their continued utility. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147345751"

Although funding agencies encourage the formation of interdisciplinary and interprofessional research teams, we know little about how our interdisciplinary and interprofessional research teams are functioning, nor how best to ensure their success. Indeed, while HPE Scholarship Units and research environments have been the object of study, little work has been focused on research teams themselves. In this article, the authors propose that research teams should be studied as unique instantiations of teams where several individuals work together towards a common goal. Considering research teams as a team can encourage attention to how effective teams are built, supported, and celebrated, it can acknowledge that competent individuals may form incompetent teams, and it opens important avenues for future research. Turning our attention to better understanding how and when research teams thrive should support the development of more effective teams; resulting in reduced waste and redundancy, better mobilization of team members’ time and skills, and enhanced knowledge generation. Considering research teams as teams, encourages an understanding that these teams require care, commitment, and effort to sustain them, and it acknowledges that pursuing research in a team context is both a collaborative and a social endeavour. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203716356"

Since physicians’ identities are heavily influenced by their basic medical training, education in ethics during this period would facilitate their professional development. To enable this, some global and national organizations have published guidelines detailing the aspects of ethics that need to be taught to medical student. However, it is not known how many such guidelines exist and to what extent they concur or differ. Aim: This study aims to identify and examine the content of existing national or international guidelines on the inclusion of ethics in basic medical education, in the English language. By doing so, it hopes to explore and highlight the similarities and differences regarding their pedagogical goals and their prescribed content, thereby contributing to a more holistic understanding on the state of medical ethics education. Methods: Data collection was performed through systematic searches on Google and on scientific databases. The guidelines that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were thematically analyzed using the method proposed by Braun and Clarke (2006). The resulting themes and sub-themes were grouped and characterized. Results: Thirteen guidelines (ten national and three international) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Among these, two major approaches can be discerned: value-based and norm-based. Value-based guidelines tend to be more globally applicable, because they endorse more abstract and universal principles. Norm-based guidelines, on the other hand, are more context-specific and have a practical focus. Understanding this distinction could facilitate discussions on different perspectives in ethics education. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147349796"

Learning approaches are often conceptualized as a dichotomy of superficial and deep, and learning outcomes are typically viewed on a cognitive scale that ranges from lower- to higher-order. While there appears to be an inherent relationship between learning approach and outcomes where superficial approaches lead to lower-order learning and deep approaches result in higher-order learning, this concept is not well documented. The purpose of this study is to better understand this relationship by evaluating whether student performance on higher- and lower-order examination questions is influenced by the approach a student takes when studying. To investigate this, survey and examination data were collected from an upper-level undergraduate Human Anatomy course at the University of Cincinnati. Results indicate that, on average, students in the course favored a deep approach to learning. The impact that learning approach had on examination performance was investigated using a series of analytical approaches, which revealed that students who took a deep approach to learning performed marginally better on both higher- and lower-order examination questions in lecture and practical examination settings. These results are contextualized within the literature, which highlights the need for more research surrounding the interrelatedness and dependency of categories within both learning approaches and cognitive levels. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147340344"

However, few tools have systematically revealed the dilemmas and challenges faced by residents. This study aimed to develop a checklist for professionalism dilemmas based on a behavior-based professionalism framework and to examine the range and proportion of professionalism dilemmas heard of, witnessed, or experienced by Chinese residents. Mixed methods were used, comprising qualitative (document analysis and focus group interviews) and quantitative (a small-scale questionnaire survey) data. Document analysis summarized professionalism dilemma items from previous publications. For focus group interviews, we used narrative inquiry to explore and make sense of residents’ experiences and perceptions of professionalism dilemmas. A small-scale questionnaire survey was conducted during each focus group to investigate the proportion of professionalism dilemma items that residents reported to have heard of, witnessed, or experienced. Through document analysis and focus group interviews, we developed a checklist of professionalism dilemmas based on a behavior-based professionalism framework. The checklist included 58 items over four domains, with 10 sub-domains (compassion, respect, communication, collaboration, integrity, duty, pursuit of excellence, fair stewardship of health care resources, patient confidentiality, and informed consent). We also sought a preliminarily subjective impression by exploring the proportion of residents who have heard of, witnessed, and experienced each of the professionalism dilemma items and residents’ perspectives when faced with professionalism dilemmas. Residents inevitably encounter or experience a diverse range of professionalism dilemmas. This checklist of professionalism dilemmas that was developed could prove to be a significant reference for targeted professionalism education, both for the resident as well as for faculty. It can also act as a helpful tool for improving hospital management guidelines and patient education. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165130229"

Staff appear as passive objects in literature and minimized in institutional reports. These characterizations contribute to the undervaluing of staff and can lead to inefficiencies or tensions in the working environment within health professions education. This study sought to identify discourses connected to the undervaluing of staff work. This study used a Foucauldian-inspired critical discourse analysis approach within the context of a single Canadian Faculty of Medicine. Data collection involved compiling an archive of published literature and institutional archival documents extending approximately 150 years, interviews with twelve staff members and nine faculty members, and the author’s lived experience as staff. Three primary discourses of staff were identified: staff as caregiver, matriarch, and professional. These discourses regulate staff (and their relations with faculty) differently, creating differences in what staff and faculty can do, be, or say (or not do, be, or say). While in the first two discourses of caregiver and matriarch, staff power is largely absent or obscured, in the third discourse, differing constructs of the concept of “professional” used by faculty and staff demonstrate a rise in power of staff and the declining authority of faculty. Writing administrative staff back in and centring staff voices can help provide agency to staff and reduce or help navigate possible tensions in the workplace. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195574402"

Therefore, this Australian study, underpinned by temporal theory, explores the preparedness transitions of medicine and pharmacy graduates. Our 6-month qualitative longitudinal study involved 12 medicine and 7 pharmacy learners after purposive sampling. They participated in an entrance interview before starting internship, longitudinal audio-diaries during their first three months of internship, and an exit interview. Framework analysis explored patterns in the data cross-sectionally and longitudinally for the whole cohort (thinking over time), with pen portraits illustrating individuals’ journeys (thinking through time). Preparedness and unpreparedness narratives involved practical skills and tasks, interpersonal skills, knowledge, and professional practice for medicine and pharmacy. However, narratives for practical skills and tasks, and professional practice were dominant amongst medicine graduates, while narratives for interpersonal skills and knowledge were dominant amongst pharmacy graduates. We found numerous cohort changes in feelings of preparedness over time, but the illustrative pen portraits demonstrated the complexities and nuances through time, including feelings of preparedness before internship becoming unpreparedness during internship (e.g., cannulas), improving preparedness through time (e.g., cover shifts), and persistent feelings of unpreparedness (e.g., patient interactions). While our cross-sectional findings are reasonably consistent with existing research, our comparative and longitudinal findings are novel. We recommend that educators build learners’ preparedness through uniprofessional transition interventions involving practical skills and tasks, and professional practice in medicine, and interpersonal skills and knowledge in pharmacy. More importantly, we recommend multiprofessional transition interventions for medicine and pharmacy learners before internship focusing on knowledge, and during internship focusing on practical skills and tasks. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203993981"

Instead of exploring student satisfaction from the perspectives of education quality and organizational factors, this study focused on student engagement to explore the impact of it on student satisfaction with medical education in China. Student engagement refers to students’ actions, efforts and persistence, indicating both time and energy students invested in educationally purposeful activities, especially academic activities. The data used in this study came from the first national survey of clinical undergraduates—the China Medical Student Survey—in which 10,062 clinical medical undergraduates in 33 medical schools participated. We developed a model of medical student engagement and satisfaction and utilized descriptive statistics, ordered logit regression, and path analysis to describe the relationship between medical student engagement and satisfaction. In this study, student engagement was categorized into behavioral, emotional and cognitive dimensions. The findings showed that medical student satisfaction was relatively low and was significantly affected by student satisfaction, especially the behavioral engagement in clinical rotations and professional identity of emotional engagement. These findings could put a supplementary perspective on improving student satisfaction through student engagement, and offer notable implications for future research and practice. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152786008"

However, empirical research into the experience of embodiment in learning in CPD is sparse, particularly in the practice of general medicine. In this study, we aimed to explore general practitioners’ (GPs’) learning experiences during CPD from an embodiment perspective, studying the appearance of elements of embodiment—the body, actions, emotions, cognition, and interactions with the surroundings and others—to build an explanatory structure of embodiment in learning. We drew on the concepts of embodied affectivity and mutual incorporation to frame our understanding of embodiment. Four Danish and three Canadian GPs were interviewed to gain insight into specific learning experiences; the interviews and the analysis were inspired by micro-phenomenology, augmented with a complex adaptive systems approach. We constructed an explanatory structure of learning with two entrance points (disharmony and mundanity), an eight-component learning phase, and an ending phase with two exit points (harmony and continuing imbalance). All components of the learning phase—community, pride, validation, rehearsal, do-ability, mind-space, ambiance, and preparing for the future—shared features of embodied affectivity and mutual incorporation and interacted in multi-directional and non-linear ways. We discuss integrating the embodiment perspective into existing learning theories and argue that CPD for GPs would benefit from doing so. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191791322"

Research has demonstrated that such interpretations matter to practices and people concerned. We therefore sought to identify the different conceptualisations espoused by these approaches and investigated their implications for education. We critically reviewed 52 articles from eight top medical education journals and subjected these to a conceptual analysis. Via open coding, we looked for references to approaches, their objectives, implicit notions of culture, and to implementation practices. We iteratively developed themes from the collected findings. We identified several approaches to cultural diversity teaching that used four different ways to conceptualise cultural diversity: culture as ‘fixed patient characteristic’, as ‘multiple fixed characteristics’, as ‘dynamic outcome impacting social interactions’, and as ‘power dynamics’. We discussed the assumptions underlying these different notions, and reflected upon limitations and implications for educational practice. The notion of ‘cultural diversity’ challenges learners’ communication skills, touches upon inherent inequalities and impacts how the field constructs knowledge. This study adds insights into how inherent inequalities in biomedical knowledge construction are rooted in methodological, ontological, and epistemological principles. Although these insights carry laborious implications for educational implementation, educators can learn from first initiatives, such as: standardly include information on patients’ multiple identities and lived experiences in case descriptions, stimulate more reflection on teachers’ and students’ own values and hierarchical position, acknowledge Western epistemological hegemony, explicitly include literature from diverse sources, and monitor diversity-integrated topics in the curriculum. © The Author(s) 2024.","Review","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204248351"

However, it is unclear whether student nurses who experience ethical decision-making competence in their clinical internships have a protective effect against moral distress, resilience-protective factors, and resilience. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effects of ethical decision-making competence on moral distress, resilience, and protective factors among nursing students. The participants were recruited from five nursing schools. The study employed measurement tools, including the Ethical Decision-Making Competence Scale, Scale of Protective Factor-24, Resilience Scale, and Moral Distress Scale–Revised. We applied the partial least squares approach to structural equation modeling and multi-group analysis to analyze the data using SmartPLS software. A group of 134 student nurses participated in this study (72 women and 62 men). Findings revealed that student nurses with higher ethical decision-making competence experienced lower moral distress and greater resilience and protective factors. Students with higher protective factors demonstrated greater resilience. However, resilience was not significantly associated with moral distress. Ethical decision-making competence partially and indirectly affected resilience via protective factors. This study recommends that the cultivation of clinical nursing practice focus on student nurses’ ethical decision-making competencies. Narratives (e.g., moving stories that illustrate human suffering) can prompt students to reflect on the role of the ethical subject in a situation and further enhance their ability to identify ethical issues and apply ethical principles appropriately. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211324756"

To address this, university and training programmes are increasingly using technological advancements and data analytic tools to provide feedback. One such educational technology is the Learning Analytic Dashboard (LAD), which holds the promise of a comprehensive view of student performance via partial or fully automated feedback delivered to learners in real time. The possibility of displaying performance data visually, on a single platform, so users can access and process feedback efficiently and constantly, and use this to improve their performance, is very attractive to users, educators and institutions. However, the mainstream literature tends to take an atheoretical and instrumentalist view of LADs, a view that uncritically celebrates the promise of LAD’s capacity to provide a ‘technical fix’ to the ‘wicked problem’ of feedback in health professions education. This paper seeks to recast the discussion of LADs as something other than a benign material technology using the lenses of Miller and Rose’s technologies of government and Barry’s theory of Technological Societies, where such technical devices are also inherently agentic and political. An examination of the purpose, design and deployment of LADs from these theoretical perspectives can reveal how these educational devices shape and govern the HPE learner body in different ways, which in turn, may produce a myriad of unintended– and ironic– effects on the feedback process. In this Reflections article we wish to encourage health professions education scholars to examine the practices and consequences thereof of the ever-expanding use of LADs more deeply and with a sense of urgency. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202064565"

Distress, anxiety and burnout are on the rise, and are particularly concerning for health professions’ students who must navigate challenging academic and clinical demands, in addition to personal responsibilities. While not a panacea for the systemic issues at play, ‘mindfulness practices’ have shown some promise in supporting students to navigate stressful environments. Yet despite calls for more phenomenological studies, little is known about health professions students’ lived experiences of learning about and using mindfulness in higher education contexts. The objective of this hermeneutic phenomenological study was to inquire into the first-hand lived experiences of health professions students by examining their written reflections on learning about and using mindfulness in a higher education context. The study reports on themes identified in an analysis of students’ phenomenological reflections written during and following a mindfulness elective course offered at a Canadian University. The analysis revealed four predominant themes: (a) reframing perceptions, (b)‘being’ while ‘doing’, (c) witnessing the struggle, and (d) compassion for self and others. In a time when health professionals are increasingly under strain, and systemic reform is needed but slow to take shape, the findings of this study reveal potential affordances of mindfulness for helping students to navigate the myriad of challenges they face. The findings are unique in their in-depth exploration of students’ reflections on the experience of learning about and engaging in ‘mindfulness practices’ in a higher education context. The findings contribute first-hand perspectives to the evolving field of mindfulness education research and generate new conversations about mindfulness education in the health professions curriculum. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203348466"

However, in an ever-compressed medical curriculum, learning and practicing this skill can be challenging. Previous studies (including work with pigeons) have suggested that using reward-feedback-based activities, novices can gain expert levels of visual diagnostic accuracy in shortened training times. But is this level of diagnostic accuracy a result of image recognition (categorization) or is it the acquisition of diagnostic expertise? To answer this, the authors measured electroencephalographic data (EEG) and two components of the human event-related brain potential (reward positivity and N170) to explore the nature of visual expertise in a novice-expert study in pathology visual diagnosis. It was found that the amplitude of the reward positivity decreased with learning in novices (suggesting a decrease in reliance on feedback, as in other studies). However, this signal remained significantly different from the experts whose reward positivity signal did not change over the course of the experiment. There were no changes in the amplitude of the N170 (a reported neural marker of visual expertise) in novices over time. Novice N170 signals remained statistically and significantly lower in amplitude compared to experts throughout task performance. These data suggest that, while novices gained the ability to recognize (categorize) pathologies through reinforcement learning as quantified by the change in reward positivity, increased accuracy, and decreased time for responses, there was little change in the neural marker associated with visual expertise (N170). This is consistent with the multi-dimensional and complex nature of visual expertise and provides insight into future training programs for novices to bridge the expertise gap. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159312960"

Despite the importance of SRL, empirical evidence linking SRL to academic performance has been mixed. This study aims to quantify the association between SRL and the academic performance of medical students. A one-year longitudinal study was conducted consisting of two waves separated by one year, wherein students from China Medical University who were enrolled in the clinical medicine program in 2018 were randomly selected and followed. Participants provided socioeconomic information in the first wave and completed the Self-regulated Learning Perception Scale (SRLPS) in both waves. Participants’ academic performance was assessed using Grade-point Average (GPA) scores for the following year. Fixed-effects models were utilized to address potential endogeneity issues when investigating the association between SRL and academic performance based on the longitudinal data collected. The final sampled data consisted of 395 medical students who completed two rounds of questionnaires. The overall score of SRL was positively correlated with academic performance insignificantly (β = 0.007, SE = 0.004). However, the domain, Learning motivation and action, was significantly positively correlated with academic performance (β = 0.052, SE = 0.020), while the other domain, Lack of self-directedness, was significantly negatively correlated with academic performance (β=-0.037, SE = 0.009).

Social ties play a particularly important role for women medical students as the medical field remains largely dominated by masculine norms. However, forming social ties remains challenging for women in medicine. This study used the COVID-19 pandemic to examine how women medical students navigated the spatial contexts of medical school to form social ties. Using longitudinal qualitative research and narrative inquiry, it describes how 17 women medical students formed social ties during the early stages of COVID-19. Beginning in fall 2020, during the initial two-years of medical school, the participants (1) described how personal ties were deterred from forming in early experiences of medical school; (2) shared experiences that promoted a sense of community bonding during middle and later periods; and (3) expressed limitations of access to the formation of professional ties throughout their initial 2-years. This study has important implications for understanding ways spatial contexts, access to physical connections, and the mental and emotional barriers or pathways play roles in social tie formation for women medical students and how longitudinal qualitative research can narrate these changes through time. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210517933"

This article aims to contribute to this nascent debate by contemplating the question- is it appropriate, or possible, for a white researcher to undertake decolonisation work in dental education? If so, what would it entail or ‘look’ like? To answer this important question, the author offers a reflective account of their ethical and epistemological journey with this very question. This journey begins with how I, a white researcher, first became aware of the everyday racism experienced by my racially and ethnically minoritized students, the whiteness of dental educational spaces and how my white privilege and position as a dental educator consciously and unconsciously implicated me in these processes of exclusion and discrimination. While this revelation led to a personal commitment to do better in my practice, both as an educator and a researcher, I continue to struggle with my white ignorance and white fragility as I strive to make my work more inclusive. To illustrate this, I discuss an ethnodrama project on everyday racism that I lead on and how, despite choosing a more democratic research method, hegemonic whiteness continued to make its presence felt through my ‘going it alone’ method of work. This reflective account reaffirms that regular and routine self-reflection is key to ensuring that racialised inappropriate and damaging assumptions, frameworks of thinking, and ways of working are checked for. However, my praxis won’t evolve through critical introspection alone. I need to be open to making mistakes, educating myself about racism and anti-racist practice, asking for help and guidance from my minoritized colleagues and more importantly, committing to working with people from minoritized communities rather than on them. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153057496"

For some, feedback is a conversation about defining and improving performance, while for others it is the information generated by assessments and tools. Indeed, feedback has variously been defined as a process, as data, as a conversation, and as a reflective exercise. As a result, for a concept so central to what educators do, ‘feedback’ is ambiguous and has multiple meanings. Pattern theory affords opportunities to examine what scholars and practitioners mean when they use the term ‘feedback’. Elaborating feedback as a pattern system can connect otherwise disjointed discourses of feedback. In this paper, the authors describe the development of a pattern system of feedback in medical education. Arksey & O’Malley’s 5-stages of scoping reviews were adapted to enact a 6-step pattern system development methodology that included (1) Identifying the research question and scope of inquiry; (2) elaborating a strategy for pattern identification; (3) study selection; (4) abductive pattern representation development; (5) pattern system testing; and (6) summarizing and reporting the results. A pattern system of feedback was developed based on review of 218 full text articles and testing against an additional 2833 citations. This pattern system is made up of 36 pattern representations organized under 6 domains: feedback referent, feedback intentions, feedback information, feedback processing, feedback response, and feedback meta. The pattern system was applied to two models of feedback to demonstrate its utility as a lens through which to analyze various instances of feedback and to foreshadow its potential broader applicability as a tool to facilitate knowledge synthesis in the feedback problem space. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204799947"

To better inform teaching and student support, this study aims to gain insights from summative assessments through profiling students’ performance patterns and identify those students missing the basic knowledge and skills in medical specialities essential for their future career. We use Latent Profile Analysis to classify a senior undergraduate year group (n = 295) based on their performance in applied knowledge test (AKT) and OSCE, in which items and stations are pre-classified across five specialities (e.g. Acute and Critical Care, Paediatrics,…). Four distinct groups of students with increasing average performance levels in the AKT, and three such groups in the OSCE are identified. Overall, these two classifications are positively correlated. However, some students do well in one assessment format but not in the other. Importantly, in both the AKT and the OSCE there is a mixed group containing students who have met the required standard to pass, and those who have not. This suggests that a conception of a borderline group at the exam-level can be overly simplistic. There is little literature relating AKT and OSCE performance in this way, and the paper discusses how our analysis gives placement tutors key insights into providing tailored support for distinct student groups needing remediation. It also gives additional information to assessment writers about the performance and difficulty of their assessment items/stations, and to wider faculty about student overall performance and across specialities. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199310816"

In recognition of this, multiple health profession governing bodies identify uncertainty tolerance as a healthcare graduate attribute and evaluate uncertainty tolerance within new graduate cohorts. While it is clear that uncertainty tolerance development for healthcare learners is valued, gaps remain for practically addressing this within healthcare curricula. Guiding frameworks for practical approaches supporting uncertainty tolerance development in healthcare learners remains sparse, particularly outside of medicine and in certain geographical locations. As uncertainty tolerance is increasingly recognised as being, at least in part, state-based (e.g. contextually changeable)– a broader understanding of teaching practices supporting uncertainty tolerance development in diverse health professions is warranted. This study explored educators’ teaching practices for purposefully stimulating learners’ uncertainty tolerance. Semi-structured interviews investigated how academics at a single institution, from diverse fields and health professions, stimulate uncertainty across multiple learning contexts. Framework analysis identified three themes for stimulating uncertainty: Purposeful questioning, Forecasting uncertainty, and Placing learners in unfamiliar environments, with characterisation of these themes (and related subthemes) also described. Many of the identified themes align with aspects of existing learning theories suggesting that curricular frameworks supporting learner uncertainty tolerance development may be informed by theories beyond the boundaries of health professions education research. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195832311"

However, there is a lack of understanding on how to best prepare health professionals for collaborative practice. The aim of this research is to gain a better understanding of how graduates of five health professions (dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, physiotherapy) perceive and experience interprofessional education for collaborative practice (IPECP) throughout their health professions journey, with a focus on transition to practice. This longitudinal study employed an interpretive, narrative methodology to understand interprofessional identity development of 24 individuals who had recently graduated from a health professions program (dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, physiotherapy) at a Canadian university. Participant experiences were analyzed using narrative analysis. Participants’ narratives provided insight into the context, factors and curricular experiences needed for interprofessional identity development and preparedness for collaborative practice. Participants identified the importance of socialization and connection with others, collaborative role models and exposure to collaborative experiences and settings for interprofessional practice. Participants expressed some dissatisfaction with their earliest IPECP experiences and most valued their exposure to ‘real-life’ practice examples and clinical scenarios. Participants desired more authentic experiences of interprofessional collaboration during their programs. Improving health professionals’ interprofessional socialization and collaborative experiences within IPECP is critical to improving patient outcomes. Study findings can inform future curricula and IPECP strategies that create conditions to enhance collaborative practice and ensure the preparedness of a future health workforce with a strong collaborative identity. © Crown 2024.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204734054"

However, little is known about whether changes in personality traits during medical training affect the predictive validity of personality assessments. The present study addressed this issue by examining the stability of personality traits and their predictive validity over a 6-year medical training course. Participants were two cohorts of Swiss medical students (N = 272, 72% of students admitted to Year 2) from whom we collected demographic data, Swiss medical studies aptitude test (EMS) scores, Big Five personality traits scores measured at three times and scores on the multiple-choice and objective structured clinical examination parts of the final medical examination. Our findings indicated that personality traits had medium-to-high rank-order stability (r >.60 over 3 years and r >.50 over 6 years). Mean-level changes were moderate for agreeableness (d = + 0.72) and small for neuroticism and conscientiousness (d = -0.29, d = -0.25, respectively). Individual reliable change indices ranged from 4.5% for openness to 23.8% for neuroticism. The predictive validity was similar to that of the first three years of follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate changes in personality across undergraduate curriculum. Medical students’ personality traits were mostly stable across medical school and retain their predictive validity.

Providers’ responses to medical uncertainty has ramifications on the healthcare system, the healthcare provider and the patient. Understanding healthcare providers’ UT, is important for improving patient-care outcomes. Understanding whether and to what extent it is possible to modulate individuals’ perceptions and responses to medical uncertainty, can provide insights into mechanisms for support for training and education. The objectives of this review were to further characterize moderators of healthcare UT and explore moderator influences on the perceptions and responses to uncertainty experienced by healthcare professionals. Framework analysis of qualitative primary literature was conducted on 17 articles, focusing on the impacts of UT on healthcare providers. Three domains of moderators were identified and characterized relating to the healthcare provider’s personal attributes, patient-derived uncertainty and the healthcare system. These domains were further categorized into themes and subthemes. Results suggest these moderators influence perceptions and responses to healthcare uncertainty across a spectrum ranging from positive to negative to uncertain. In this way, UT could be a state-based construct within healthcare settings and is contextually determined. Our findings further characterize the integrative model of uncertainty tolerance (IMUT) (Hillen Social Science and Medicine 180, 62–75, 2017) and provide evidence for the relationship between moderators and their influences on cognitive, emotional and behavioral responses to uncertainty. These findings provide a foundation for understanding the complex nature of the UT construct, add to theory development, and provide groundwork for future research exploring appropriate support for training and education in healthcare fields. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153347867"

Transformative learning through critical reflection on disorienting learning experiences supports perspective change to direct new activity. We explored how portfolio meetings support changes in students’ perspectives towards learning and study during the transition to studying medicine. This qualitative mixed methods study explored changes in medical students’ perspectives before and after two portfolio meetings with a mentor during the first year of medicine. Adopting a constructionist approach, we analyzed interview transcripts and written reflections from a diverse sample of students using reflexive thematic analysis. The findings were integrated during analysis. Transformative learning theory was our interpretive lens. Our analysis revealed five themes. Two themes represented students’ initial apprehension about portfolio meetings: The Disclosure Dilemma and A Question of Priorities. The theme “Seeing the Big Picture” described new perspectives from reflection on learning while preparing for meetings. Clarity from Dialogue described changed perspectives to learning and study after meetings. In the theme Dialogue Disappointment, meetings perceived as unhelpful led to persisting doubts about the value of portfolio meetings. Transformative learning was evident when students described new insights into their learning leading to goal-setting and new study strategies. When initial meetings were helpful, doubts about portfolio meetings were dispelled, enhancing student engagement in future meetings. Not all meetings were transformative, highlighting the importance of student and mentor preparation and training. Further research is needed to determine whether early portfolio experiences shape later engagement in clinical contexts. © Crown 2024.","Article","Article in press","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208019711"

However, one of the most often used approaches to interprofessional continuing education designed to improve teams’ ability to respond to unanticipated critical events still emphasizes surgeon leadership. We developed Explicit Anesthesia and Nurse Distributed (EXPAND) Leadership to imagine a workflow that might better distribute emergency leadership task responsibilities and practices. The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate teams’ responses to distributing leadership during an interprofessional continuing education simulated obstetrical emergency. We used interpretive descriptive design in a secondary analysis of teams’ post-simulation reflective debriefings. One-hundred sixty providers participated, including OB-Gyn surgeons, anesthesiologists, CRNAs, scrub technicians, and nurses. Using reflective thematic analysis, we identified three core themes: 1) The surgeon is focused on the surgical field, 2) Explicit leadership initiates a nurse transition from follower to leader in a hierarchical environment, and 3) Explicit distributed leadership enhances teamwork and taskwork. Continuing education which uses distributed leadership to improve teams’ ability to respond to an obstetric emergency is perceived to enhance team members’ response to the critical event. The potential for nurses’ career growth and professional transformation was an unexpected finding associated with this continuing education which used distributed leadership. Our findings suggest that healthcare educators should consider ways in which distributed leadership may improve teams’ response to critical events in the operating room. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152042470"

Such transformation and renewal processes hold significant implications for those educators responsible for implementing the curriculum. Currently little is known about how health professions educators across disciplines understand a responsive curriculum and how this understanding might influence their practice. We looked at curricula that aim to deliver future health care professionals who are not only clinically competent but also critically conscious of the contexts in which they serve and the health care systems within which they practice. We conducted a qualitative study across six institutions in South Africa, using focus group discussions and in-depth individual interviews to explore (i) how do health professions educators understand the principles that underpin their health professions education curriculum; and (ii) how do these understandings of health professions educators shape their teaching practices? The transcripts were analysed thematically following multiple iterations of critical engagement to identify patterns of meaning across the entire dataset. The results reflected a range of understandings related to knowing, doing, and being and becoming; and a range of teaching practices that are explicit, intentionally designed, take learning to the community, embrace a holistic approach, encourage safe dialogic encounters, and foster reflective practice through a complex manner of interacting. This study contributes to the literature on health professions education as a force for social justice. It highlights the implications of transformative curriculum renewal and offers insights on how health professions educators embrace notions of social responsiveness and health equity to engage with these underlying principles within their teaching. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147370998"

If clinical competency in oncology decision-making guidance is to be taught deliberately and effectively, it is necessary to understand resident experiences in this context to develop appropriate educational and faculty development initiatives. Four junior and two senior postgraduate oncology residents participated in semi-structured interviews during October and November 2021 which explored their experiences of real-world decision-making scenarios. Van Manen’s phenomenology of practice was used in an interpretivist research paradigm. Transcripts were analysed to articulate essential experiential themes, and composite vocative narratives were created. Three essential themes were identified: (1) residents often endorsed different decision-making approaches than supervising consultants, (2) residents experienced inner conflict, and (3) residents struggled to find their own approach to decision-making. Residents experienced being torn between a perceived obligation to defer to consultant directives, and a desire for increasing ownership of decision-making while not feeling empowered to discuss their opinions with the consultants. Residents described their experiences around ethical position awareness during decision-making in a clinical teaching context as challenging, with experiences suggesting moral distress combined with inadequate psychological safety to address ethical conflicts and unresolved questions of decision ownership with supervisors. These results suggest the need for enhanced dialogue and more research to reduce resident distress during oncology decision-making. Future research should be aimed at discovering novel ways in which residents and consultants could interact in a unique clinical learning context including graduated autonomy, a hierarchical gradient, ethical positions, physician values, and sharing of responsibility. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152444467"

By “rater training,” they mean the educational events intended to improve rater performance and contributions during assessment events. Historically, rater training programs have focused on modifying faculty behaviours to achieve psychometric ideals (e.g., reliability, inter-rater reliability, accuracy). The authors argue these ideals may now be poorly aligned with contemporary research informing work-based assessment, introducing a compatibility threat, with no clear direction on how to proceed. To address this issue, the authors provide a brief historical review of “rater training” and provide an analysis of the literature examining the effectiveness of rater training programs. They focus mainly on what has served to define effectiveness or improvements. They then draw on philosophical and conceptual shifts in assessment to demonstrate why the function, effectiveness aims, and structure of rater training requires reimagining. These include shifting competencies for assessors, viewing assessment as a complex cognitive task enacted in a social context, evolving views on biases, and reprioritizing which validity evidence should be most sought in medical education. The authors aim to advance the discussion on rater training by challenging implicit incompatibility issues and stimulating ways to overcome them. They propose that “rater training” (a moniker they suggest be reserved for strong psychometric aims) be augmented with “assessor readiness” programs that link to contemporary assessment science and enact the principle of compatibility between that science and ways of engaging with advances in real-world faculty-learner contexts. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158045902"

Apart from surgical education, robots have also been widely employed in assistive and rehabilitation procedures, where education has traditionally focused in the patient. Therefore, there has been extensive review bibliography in the field of medical robotics focused on surgical and rehabilitation and assistive robots, but there is a lack of survey papers that explore the potential of robotics in the education of healthcare students and professionals beyond their training in the use of the robotic system. The scope of the current review are works in which robots are used as didactic tools for the education of professionals in health sciences, investigating the enablers and barriers that affect the use of robots as learning facilitators. Systematic literature searches were conducted in WOS and Scopus, yielding a total of 3812 candidate papers. After removing duplicates, inclusion criteria were defined and applied, resulting in 171 papers. An in-depth quality assessment was then performed leading to 26 papers for qualitative synthesis. Results show that robots in health sciences education are still developed with a roboticist mindset, without clearly incorporating aspects of the teaching/learning process. However, they have proven potential to be used in health sciences as they allow to parameterize procedures, autonomously guide learners to achieve greater engagement, or enable collective learning including patients and instructors ""in the loop"". Although there exist documented added-value benefits, further research and efforts needs to be done to foster the inclusion of robots as didactic tools in the curricula of health sciences professionals. On the one hand, by analyzing how robotic technology should be developed to become more flexible and usable to support both teaching and learning processes in health sciences education, as final users are not necessarily well-versed in how to use it. On the other, there continues to be a need to develop effective and standard robotic enhanced learning evaluation tools, as well good quality studies that describe effective evaluation of robotic enhanced education for professionals in health sciences. As happens with other technologies when applied to the health sciences field, studies often fail to provide sufficient detail to support transferability or direct future robotic health care education programs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133171750"

Fostering adaptive expertise requires careful approaches to instructional design to emphasize deeper, more effortful learning. These teaching strategies are time-intensive, effortful, and challenging to implement in health professions education curricula. The authors are educators whose missions encompass the medical education continuum, from undergraduate through to organizational learning. Each has grappled with how to promote adaptive expertise development in their context. They describe themes drawn from educational experiences at these various learner levels to illustrate strategies that may be used to cultivate adaptive expertise. At Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, a restructuring of the medical school curriculum provided multiple opportunities to use specific curricular strategies to foster adaptive expertise development. The advantage for students in terms of future learning had to be rationalized against assessments that are more short-term in nature. In a consortium of emergency medicine residency programs, a diversity of instructional approaches was deployed to foster adaptive expertise within complex clinical learning environments. Here the value of adaptive expertise approaches must be balanced with the efficiency imperative in clinical care. At Mayo Clinic, an existing continuous professional development program was used to orient the entire organization towards an adaptive expertise mindset, with each individual making a contribution to the shift. The different contexts illustrate both the flexibility of the adaptive expertise conceptualization and the need to customize the educational approach to the developmental stage of the learner. In particular, an important benefit of teaching to adaptive expertise is the opportunity to influence individual professional identity formation to ensure that clinicians of the future value deeper, more effortful learning strategies throughout their careers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142214754"

Research Institute for Learning and Education, Faculty of Psychology and Education, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Learning to adapt to new contexts is crucial in health professions education (HPE). Boundaries between and within contexts challenge continuity in students’ learning processes. Little is known about how HPE students can make these “boundary experiences” productive for learning. We investigated how and what nursing students learn from boundary experiences while they are simultaneously growing into a community of practice (CoP). Using a boundary-crossing lens, experiences of discontinuity were identified in pre-placement and post-placement interviews and diary fragments with 14 nursing students during their placement in an academic hospital. We found that students experience discontinuity as a result of different approaches to nursing care and to learning, both between (academic and clinical) settings and within a setting. When students feel safe enough, they can convert boundary experiences into meaningful learning situations, such as critical discussions with staff. Successfully overcoming boundary experiences improves students’ understanding of healthcare and professional development and helps them to develop a personal approach to learning. Students critically address boundary experiences when they are motivated to learn and when they perceive a violation of ethical standards but not when they are concerned that it will affect their assessment. Objects designed to bridge theory and practice can generate additional barriers. This study adds to the HPE literature by demonstrating the learning potential of boundaries and to the broader literature by showing how responses to boundary experiences are intertwined with the process of growing into a CoP. The findings can be used to design future boundary objects. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134061233"

There has been a rapid growth in the number of review articles on the topic. To prevent diffusion of knowledge and support future research it is necessary to gather the existing knowledge in a single place. The purpose of the present article is to bring together the existing reviews on speaking up to create a source of unified knowledge representing the current ""State of the Art"" to advance future research and practice. A State-of-the-Art review was conducted to synthesize the existing knowledge on speaking up. Six databases were searched. Fourteen review articles spanning 2012 to 2021 were identified. Five main research questions have been investigated in the literature and five common recommendations for improvement are made, the knowledge across all reviews related to the research questions and recommendations was synthesized. Additionally, simulation-based research was frequently identified as an important though limited method. Further issues in the literature are identified and recommendations for improvement are made. A synthesis was successfully developed: knowledge about speaking up and research related to speaking up is in an emergent state with more shortcomings, questions, and avenues for improvement than certitude. The whys and how of speaking up remain open questions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131450378"

This paper reports on findings from a postcritical ethnographic study of the practice of service user involvement (SUI), in which we reflexively inquired into conceptualizations of service user educators’ knowledge contributions to health professional education in the accounts of both service user- and health professional educators. This research was conducted in response to recent calls for greater scrutiny surrounding the risks, challenges, and complexities inherent in involving service users in health professional education spaces. ‘Story/telling’ was identified as a pronounced overarching construct in our analysis, which focuses on participants’ reports of both the obvious and more subtle tensions and complexities they experience in relation to storytelling as a predominant tool or approach to SUI. Our findings are presented as three distinct, yet overlapping, themes related to these complexities or tensions: (a) performative expectations; (b) the invisible work of storytelling; and (c) broadening conceptualizations of service user educators’ knowledge. Our findings and discussion contribute to a growing body of literature which problematizes the uncritical solicitation of service user educators’ stories in health professional education and highlights the need for greater consideration of the emotional and epistemic labour expected of those who are invited to share their stories. This paper concludes with generative recommendations and reflexive prompts for health professional educators seeking to engage service user educators in health professional education through the practice of storytelling. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137566040"

TCs are claimed to be conceptual gateways which are often traversed with substantial difficulty. In this paper, we report on a scoping review investigating the following research question: What is the scope and nature of the currently available research on threshold concepts in health professions education literature? We employed Arksey and O’Malley’s model for scoping reviews. A search for literature on TCs in HPE research between 2003 and 2020 yielded 999 records of which 59 were included in the review. The data set was subject to quantitative descriptive analysis of article characteristics as well as qualitative thematic analysis of the scope of research on TCs. Among the 59 articles selected for review, there were 30 empirical, 26 conceptual and three reviews. A majority were published in 2015 or later. Almost half of the included articles attempted to identify possible TCs within HPE. Others investigated how TCs can be traversed or suggested how TCs could influence curriculum design. Some critically appraised the framework of TC. Although TCs are increasingly utilised in HPE, the present review identified how researchers came across methodological challenges related to identifying possible TCs and definitional challenges around identifying the essential characteristics of TCs. Before embracing TCs as the next go-to theory for learning in HPE, we acknowledge the need for methodological stringeny and rigour as well as more data to support TCs. Until then, any implementation of TCs in HPE curricula should be done cautiously. © 2022, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132293970"

There are conflicting perspectives and evidence on the effects supervisor-trainee relationships have on assessing performance. The aim of this study was to learn how progress evaluations are used in postgraduate education with longitudinal supervisor-trainee relationships. Progress evaluations in a two-year community-pharmacy specialization program were studied with a mixed-method approach. An adapted version of the Canadian Medical Education Directives for Specialists (CanMEDS) framework was used. Validity of the performance evaluation scores of 342 trainees was analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. Semi-structured interviews were held with fifteen supervisors to investigate their response processes, the utility of the progress evaluations, and the influence of supervisor-trainee relationships. Time and CanMEDS roles affected the three-monthly progress evaluation scores. Interviews revealed that supervisors varied in their response processes. They were more committed to stimulating development than to scoring actual performance. Progress evaluations were utilized to discuss and give feedback on trainee development and to add structure to the learning process. A positive supervisor-trainee relationship was seen as the foundation for feedback and supervisors preferred the roles of educator, mentor, and coach over the role of assessor. We found that progress evaluations are a good method for directing feedback in longitudinal supervisor-trainee relationships. The reliability of scoring performance was low. We recommend progress evaluations to be independent of formal assessments in order to minimize roles-conflicts of supervisors. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137928198"

But what happens to the case presentation, a genre that governs physician (and learner) talk about patients, when it is used in patients’ presence? While they were commonly used at the bedside in the past, case presentations today are more commonly performed in hallways or conference rooms, out of patient earshot. This paper draws on interview data from a study involving patient-present case presentations in a medical education setting. Our analysis asks what participants’ metageneric comments about the encounter can teach us about the genre, about patient involvement in medical education, and about linguistic adaptations to the genre that the profession might make to support patient involvement. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127604407"

Most medical career studies performed in the U.S. focused on the effect of demographic variables and medical education debt on career choice. Considering ongoing U.S. physician workforce shortages and the trilateral adaptive model of career decision making, a robust assessment of professional attitudes and work-life preferences is necessary. The objective of this study was to explore and define the dominant viewpoints related to career choice selection in a cohort of U.S. IM residents. We administered an electronic Q-sort in which 218 IM residents sorted 50 statements reflecting the spectrum of opinions that influence postgraduate career choice decisions. Participants provided comments that explained the reasoning behind their individual responses. In the final year of residency training, we ascertained participating residents’ chosen career. Factor analysis grouped similar sorts and revealed four distinct viewpoints. We characterized the viewpoints as “Fellowship-Bound-Academic,” “Altruistic-Longitudinal-Generalist,” “Inpatient-Burnout-Aware,” and “Lifestyle-Focused-Consultant.” There is concordance between residents who loaded significantly onto a viewpoint and their ultimate career choice. Four dominant career choice viewpoints were found among contemporary U.S. IM residents. These viewpoints reflect the intersection of competing priorities, personal interests, professional identity, socio-economic factors, and work/life satisfaction. Better appreciation of determinants of IM residents’ career choices may help address workforce shortages and enhance professional satisfaction. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140292698"

Interestingly, research has paid little attention to the content of the cases used in clinical reasoning education. Malpractice claims of diagnostic errors represent cases that impact patients and that reflect potential knowledge gaps and contextual factors. With this study, we aimed to identify and prioritize educational content from a malpractice claims database in order to improve clinical reasoning education in GP training. With input from various experts in clinical reasoning and diagnostic error, we defined five priority criteria that reflect educational relevance. Fifty unique medical conditions from a malpractice claims database were scored on those priority criteria by stakeholders in clinical reasoning education in 2021. Subsequently, we calculated the mean total priority score for each condition. Mean total priority score (min 5–max 25) for all fifty diagnoses was 17,11 with a range from 13,89 to 19,61. We identified and described the fifteen highest scoring diseases (with priority scores ranging from 18,17 to 19,61). The prioritized conditions involved complex common (e.g., cardiovascular diseases, renal insufficiency and cancer), complex rare (e.g., endocarditis, ectopic pregnancy, testicular torsion) and more straightforward common conditions (e.g., tendon rupture/injury, eye infection). The claim cases often demonstrated atypical presentations or complex contextual factors. Including those malpractice cases in GP vocational training could enrich the illness scripts of diseases that are at high risk of errors, which may reduce diagnostic error and related patient harm. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144186034"

Although an expansive body of literature suggests that the experience of meaning at work is critical to professional wellbeing, relatively little attention has been paid to how this might be leveraged in the educational milieu. We propose that professional identity formation (PIF), the process by which trainees come to not only attain competence, but additionally to “think, act and feel” like physicians, affords us a unique opportunity to ground trainees in the meaningfulness of their work. Using the widely accepted tri-partite model of meaning, we outline how this process can contribute to wellbeing. We suggest strategies to optimize the influence of PIF on wellbeing, offering curricular suggestions, as well as ideas regarding the respective roles of communities of practice, teachers, and formative educational experiences. Collectively, these encourage trainees to act as intentional agents in the making of their novel professional selves, anchoring them to the meaningfulness of their work, and supporting their short and long-term wellbeing. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149543505"

In this study, we examined students’ growth patterns using progress tests in the first year of medical school to identify students at risk for failing United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1. Method: Growth Mixture Modeling (GMM) was used to examine the growth trajectories based on NBME progress test scores in the first year of medical school. Achieving a passing score on the USMLE Step 1 at the end of the second year of medical school was used as the distal outcome, controlling for Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) scores and underrepresented in medicine (URiM) status. Results: A total of 518 students from a US medical school were included in the analysis. Five different growth patterns were identified based on students’ NBME test results. Seventy-eight students identified in Group 1 had the lowest starting NBME test score (mean = 33.6, 95% CI 32.0–35.2) and lowest growth rate (mean = 2.30, 95% CI 2.06–2.53). All 26 students who failed Step 1 at the end of the second year were in Group 1 (failing rate = 33%). Meanwhile Group 4 (n = 65 students) had moderate starting NBME test scores (mean = 37.9, 95% CI 36.3–39.0) but the highest growth rate with mean slope at 6.07 (95% CI 5.40–6.73). This group of students achieved significant higher USMLE Step1 scores comparing with the 3 other groups of students (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our study found students had heterogeneous growth patterns in progress test results in their first year of medical school. Growth patterns were highly predictive of USMLE step 1 results. This study can provide performance benchmarks for our future students to assess their progress and for medical educators to identify students who need support and guidance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125776516"

Fundamental to programmatic assessment are the attributes and buy-in of the people participating in the system. Our previous research revealed unspoken, yet influential, cultural and relationship dynamics that interact with programmatic assessment to influence success. Pulling at this thread, we conducted secondary analysis of focus groups and interviews (n = 44 supervisors) using the critical lens of Positioning Theory to explore how workplace supervisors experienced and perceived their positioning within programmatic assessment. We found that supervisors positioned themselves in two of three ways. First, supervisors universally positioned themselves as a Teacher, describing an inherent duty to educate students. Enactment of this position was dichotomous, with some supervisors ascribing a passive and disempowered position onto students while others empowered students by cultivating an egalitarian teaching relationship. Second, two mutually exclusive positions were described—either Gatekeeper or Team Member. Supervisors positioning themselves as Gatekeepers had a duty to protect the community and were vigilant to the detection of inadequate student performance. Programmatic assessment challenged this positioning by reorientating supervisor rights and duties which diminished their perceived authority and led to frustration and resistance. In contrast, Team Members enacted a right to make a valuable contribution to programmatic assessment and felt liberated from the burden of assessment, enabling them to assent power shifts towards students and the university. Identifying supervisor positions revealed how programmatic assessment challenged traditional structures and ideologies, impeding success, and provides insights into supporting supervisors in programmatic assessment. © 2022, Crown.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143359345"

Yet, understanding how clinicians develop the sensibilities of an educator and an appreciation of the complexity of educational environments is challenging. Studies of teacher development have maintained a relatively narrow definition of educational practice. A more expansive view encompasses clinical teachers’ roles in relation to elements beyond learners or content, such as the cultures and other structures of healthcare institutions. In our online Postgraduate Certificate in Clinical Education, space and structure are intentionally created for teachers to think and talk about education with colleagues in other disciplinary contexts. We interviewed 17 students about how their approaches to teaching had changed over a year of part-time study, using their teaching philosophies, written at the start of the programme, as points of contrast. We took an abductive approach to data analysis, drawing on the literature and, unavoidably, our own reflexive interpretations of our practice outside of the research context, such as conversations with students and colleagues; our experiences of teaching and our concurrent research and scholarship. Our themes of repertoire building, perspective shifting, embodied practice, and appreciation of context, describe the increasing complexity of individuals’ considerations of teaching. We use our analysis as the basis for a discussion of the blurring of boundaries between staff and students on such programmes as both groups are engaged in an ongoing continuum of development as all teachers, continue to be learners of educational practice.

MOOCs are increasingly accessed by health professionals to support their own professional development. Despite the agreed usefulness of MOOCs, the rates of adoption are still extremely low. This study sought to understand the personal and social factors associated with MOOC adoption. Participants were newly graduated occupational therapists who registered for a leadership skills development MOOC. Qualitative interviews were conducted to understand unique perspectives of participants who did and did not complete the MOOC. Data were analyzed using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework. Participants reported they found the MOOC content beneficial in providing a foundational framework on which to develop their leadership skills. Even though MOOC content was organized into multiple small components, participants shared that they would engage with the material once a week for up to two hours. Participants reported a high level of comfort accessing the technology to complete the MOOC, however they reported that they would have preferred more interactive or synchronous learning opportunities. MOOCs are an efficient way to offer a wide variety of educational offerings to health professionals. Despite their asynchronous nature, MOOC developers should consider maximizing opportunities for learner interaction and content application learning opportunities within MOOCs to increase their overall adoption. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127642330"

We conducted an exploratory qualitative study through semi-structured interviews of 16 geriatricians experts from a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Data were analyzed via reflexive thematic analysis. The core essence of the learning experiences was described as a journey of ‘knowing when we do not know’, which was characterised by three themes: (i) Anchoring ethos of person-centric care where the experts drew upon their values to develop a holistic view of the patient beyond the medical domain, (ii) Enabling stance of being curious where their curiosity and openness to learning was nurtured through the practice of reflection, and with the benefit of time as a commodity and for development of expertise, and (iii) Scaffolding organisational culture of inquiry where an environment that is supportive of learning is built on the culture of psychological safety and the culture of mentoring.

These challenges may influence the long term moral development of medical trainees and have significant implications for future clinical practice. Despite the importance of moral development to medical education, the topic is still relatively under-explored. To gain a deeper understanding of moral development in trainees, we conducted a qualitative exploration of how caring for a stigmatized population influences their moral development. Data were collected from 48 medical trainees, including observational field notes, supplemental interviews, and medical documentation from inpatient units of two urban teaching hospitals in a Canadian context. Utilizing a practice-based approach which draws on constructivist grounded theory, we conducted constant comparative coding and analysis. We found that caring for stigmatized populations appeared to trigger frustration in medical trainees, which often perpetuated feelings of futility as well as avoidance behaviours. Additionally, hospital policies, the physical learning environment, variability in supervisory practices, and perceptions of judgment and mistrust all negatively influenced moral development and contributed to apathy and moral detachment which has implications for the future. Recognizing the dynamic and uncertain nature of care for stigmatized patients, and addressing the influence of structural and material factors provide an opportunity to support moral experiences within clinical training, and to improve inequities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131076877"

This is because as ‘knowledge producers,’ we make decisions about how to design our studies, analyze and interpret data, and report it in ways that are frequently oblivious to the harmful legacy of social science research, and how it continues to bring harm to minoritized communities. To not do so is to perpetuate a system that has historically served the dominant group at the expense of those who are limited in representing the world for themselves. This article proposes that HPE researchers engage in disruptive research practices by delinking with their disciplinary training, and reimagine their role in the research process. To accomplish this, I suggest that they engage in three strategies: attend to the research team’s composition, embrace critical theory and investigate epistemological ignorance. These strategies are nowhere close to exhaustive, and they do not extend as far as the conversation must go in reimagining our role in the research enterprise. However, in providing some initial thoughts on this topic, I hope to invite the HPE community into discussion on how we might harness our collective responsibility to resist research practices that are harmful and unjust to minoritized communities. © 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127544420"

This review used a scoping methodology with a systematic search strategy to identify relevant studies, written in English, and published before January 2021. Four medical education journals (Medical Education, Advances in Health Science Education, Medical Teacher, and Academic Medicine) and four clinical journals (Journal of the American Medical Association, Journal of General Internal Medicine, Annals of Surgery, and British Medical Journal) were purposively selected. Data extraction was charted according to a data collection form. Of 1505 screened studies, 79 studies were included. Three overarching perspectives were identified: ‘understanding errors’) (n = 31), ‘avoiding errors’ (n = 25), ‘learning from errors’ (n = 23). Studies that aimed at’understanding errors’ used qualitative methods (19/31, 61.3%) and took place in the clinical setting (19/31, 61.3%), whereas studies that aimed at ‘avoiding errors’ and ‘learning from errors’ used quantitative methods (‘avoiding errors’: 20/25, 80%, and ‘learning from errors’: 16/23, 69.6%, p = 0.007) and took place in pre-clinical (14/25, 56%) and simulated settings (10/23, 43.5%), respectively (p < 0.001). The three perspectives differed significantly in terms of inclusion of educational theory: ‘Understanding errors’ studies 16.1% (5/31),’avoiding errors’ studies 48% (12/25), and ‘learning from errors’ studies 73.9% (17/23), p < 0.001. Errors in medical education and clinical practice are defined differently, which makes comparisons difficult. A uniform understanding is not necessarily a goal but improving transparency and clarity of how errors are currently conceptualized may improve our understanding of when, why, and how to use and learn from errors in the future. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124969437"

Theories help explain how learning is advanced and offer guidance for how faculty work with patients who become involved in curriculum delivery. We conducted a systematic review to synthesise how theory shapes our understanding of patient involvement in health and social care education. Three databases were systematically searched. Studies demonstrating explicit and high-quality application of theory to patient involvement in teaching and learning or involvement within a community of health and social care educators, were included. A narrative synthesis was undertaken using Activity Theory as an analytical lens to highlight the multifaceted components of patient involvement in professional education. Seven high-quality, theoretically underpinned studies were included. Four studies applied theory to pedagogy, showing how deep learning from patient involvement occurred. Despite a growing body of studies which attempt to use theory to explain learning, many were descriptive, lacked theoretical quality and were therefore excluded. Three studies applied theory to illuminate the complexity of involving patients in the educational system, showing how patients can be supported and valued in teaching roles. This review highlights that more work is required to identify the mechanisms through which patient involvement enhances learning and, to explore what involvement within the education community means for faculty and patients. Our understandings of patient-educator partnerships for learning could be progressed by further high-quality theory driven studies, which include the patient voice. © 2022, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134513134"

Research in medicine has focused on documentation’s communicative value and not its function in learning. With time being an important commodity and electronic health records changing how we document, understanding the learning value of documentation is essential. The purpose of this study was to explore how trainee composing practices shape learning. Qualitative methods employing Rhetorical Genre Theory were used to explore clinical documentation practices among medical trainees. Data collection and analysis occurred in iterative cycles. Data included field notes and field interviews from 110 h of observing junior trainees and senior internal medicine residents participating in patient admission and follow-up visits. Analysis was focused on Paré and Smart’s framework for studying documentation as composing. From a composing lens, documentation plays a vital role in learning in clinical settings. Junior trainees were observed to be reliant on using writing to support their thinking around patient care. Before patient encounters, writing helped trainees focus on what was already known and develop a preliminary understanding of the patient’s problem(s). After encounters, writing helped trainees synthesize the data and develop an assessment and plan. Before and after the encounter, through writing, trainees also identified knowledge and data collection gaps. Our findings highlight clinical documentation as more than a communication task. Rather, the writing process itself appeared to play a pivotal role in supporting thinking. While some have proposed strategies for reducing trainee involvement, we argue that writing can be time well spent. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141099753"

This cross-sectional study was performed with students at the Ondokuz Mayıs University Medical Faculty (Samsun, Turkey) between 1 and 31 May 2019. Six hundred one (71.0%) first, second, and third-year students were included in the study. A questionnaire was employed as the data collection method. The questionnaire consisted of two parts. The first part consisted of questions investigating sociodemographic information produced by the authors by scanning the literature. The second part consisted of the School Burnout Inventory and the Psychological Sense of School Membership Scale. The relationship between the sense of school belonging, school burnout, and academic achievement was evaluated using structural equation modeling. The structural equation modeling analysis determined that school burnout played a mediating role in the relationship between the sense of school belonging and academic achievement in preclinical medical students. As the sense of belonging to the school increases in preclinical medical students, academic achievement increases. School burnout in preclinical medical students increases as a sense of school belonging decreases. Academic achievement among preclinical medical students decreases as school burnout levels increase. Increasing the sense of school belonging can be effective in preventing school burnout and increasing academic achievement. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131336756"

The dominant paradigm in the training of clinical psychologists emphasises competence-based training drawing upon a scientist practitioner model of practice, often underpinned by knowledge of evidence-based interventions. Little has changed over the past 40 years. Training is predicated upon the assumption that effective therapy is attributed to the therapist’s skills to implement specific therapeutic processes and her or his capacity to form an effective working alliance with the client or patient. We provide an argument for an alternative paradigm in which ecological principles are privileged with a view to enhancing clinical training of psychologists in health settings responsive to the trainee as well as the broader societal context in which they practice, by adopting a pedagogy which prioritizes the relationship between the person and the environment. The proposed approach brings an ecological set of assumptions to the learning experience in clinical contexts. Key principles, drawn from an ecological perspective includes: affordances, the emergence of self-organisation in clinical learning, constraints and rate limiters. The approach is supported by examples applied to clinical learning contexts. Implications for clinical training are discussed. The ways in which an ecological approach may contribute to more effective learning outcomes through the use of representative learning contexts may inform learning design, how learning is actioned in clinical psychology as well as future research on the pedagogy of clinical training. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132759045"

Visual methods are useful tools for exploring nebulous topics in health professions education; using these participatory approaches with physicians and patients might counteract the identified training challenges around HA and more importantly, remedy the exclusion of patient perspectives. In this paper we share the verbal and visual reflections of patients and physicians regarding their conceptualizations of, and engagement in ‘everyday’ advocacy. In doing so, we reveal some of HA’s hidden dimensions and what their images uncovered about the role of advocacy in patient care. Constructivist grounded theory guided data collection and analysis. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews and photo-elicitation, a visual research method that uses participant generated photographs to elicit participants knowledge and experiences around a particular topic. We invited patients living with chronic health conditions (n = 10) and physicians from diverse medical and surgical specialties (n = 14) to self-select photographs representing their experiences navigating HA in their personal and professional lives. Both groups found taking photographs useful for revealing the nuanced and circumstantial factors that either enabled or challenged their engagement in HA. While patients’ photos highlighted their embodiment of HA, physicians’ photos depicted HA as something quite elusive or as a complicated and daunting task. Photo-elicitation was a powerful tool in eliciting a diversity of perspectives that exist around the HA role and the work advocates perform; training programs might consider using visuals to augment teaching for this challenging competency. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139625695"

While literature exists describing professional identity in medicine, the relevance of this evidence to rehabilitation professionals (occupational therapy (OT), physical therapy (PT) and speech-language pathology (S-LP)) is limited due to differences between professions in decision-making authority (patient care), professional autonomy and understanding of their scope of practice. The objective was to determine the extent, range and nature of the literature on professional identity/professional identity formation in rehabilitation professionals. Findings from the scoping review based on Arksey and O’Malley’s methodological framework are presented. A search was conducted on MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), AMED, CINAHL, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses from 1996 to October 2020 for empirical and conceptual studies on OT, PT, and S-LP clinicians or students. Of 4983 retrieved records, 53 papers were selected for data extraction. Data were organised into themes for professional identity/professional identity formation: conceptual descriptors (dynamic state, multiple identities); influences (person, professional education/environments, profession-at-large). Findings are consistent with the professional identity literature in medicine. However, they point to gaps for further empirical inquiry in the role of symbols and rituals in the professional identity/professional identity formation of rehabilitation professionals, profession-specific differences between OT, PT and S-LP, and influences related to the profession-at-large on the professional identity/professional identity formation of rehabilitation professionals. These findings may help to inform professional education programs and health care and professional systems in developing resources to support professional identity formation of rehabilitation professionals. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128829217"

To foster a common understanding of the concept, we conducted a scoping review to explore how adaptive expertise has been discussed within health professions education literature. Five databases—MedLine, PubMed, ERIC, CINAHL, and PsycINFO—were searched using the exact term “adaptive expertise”, producing 212 unique articles. Fifty-eight articles met inclusion criteria. In the included articles, authors discussed the conceptual implications of adaptive expertise for health professions education, strategies for training for adaptive expertise, and research findings aimed at supporting the development of adaptive expertise or utilizing adaptive expertise as a theoretical framework. The goal of this scoping review is to establish a resource for frontline educators tasked with fostering the development of adaptive expertise in learners through education initiatives. A common understanding of adaptive expertise is essential to ensuring effective implementation in training programs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140822502"

To address this gap, our aim was to explore the attitudes of global thought leaders in HPE towards cost and value research. This was a qualitative virtual interview study underpinned by social constructionism. In telephone or videoconference interviews in 2018–2019, we asked global healthcare professional thought leaders their views regarding HPE cost and value research, outstanding research questions in this area and why addressing these questions was important. Analysis was inductive and thematic, and incorporated review and comments from the original interviewees (member checking). We interviewed 11 thought leaders, nine of whom gave later feedback on our data interpretation (member checking). We identified four themes: Cost research is really important but potentially risky (quantifying and reporting costs provides evidence for decision-making but could lead to increased accountability and loss of autonomy); I don't have the knowledge and skills (lack of economic literacy); it's not what I went into education research to do (professional identity); and it’s difficult to generate generalizable findings (the importance of context). This study contributes to a wider conversation in the literature about cost and value research by bringing in the views of global HPE thought leaders. Our findings provide insight to inform how best to engage and empower educators and researchers in the processes of asking and answering meaningful, acceptable and relevant cost and value questions in HPE. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132271760"

We undertook a systematic review and narrative synthesis to articulate the underlying validity argument in support of this tool. Although originally developed to assess readiness for independent performance of a procedure, contemporary implementation includes using the OSCORE for entrustment supervision decisions. We used systematic review methodology to search, identify, appraise and abstract relevant articles from 2005 to September 2020, across MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases. Nineteen original, English-language, quantitative or qualitative articles addressing the use of the OSCORE for health professionals’ assessment were included. We organized and synthesized the validity evidence according to Kane’s framework, articulating the validity argument and identifying evidence gaps. We demonstrate a reasonable validity argument for the OSCORE in surgical specialties, based on assessing surgical competence as readiness for independent performance for a given procedure, which relates to ad hoc, retrospective, entrustment supervision decisions. The scoring, generalization and extrapolation inferences are well-supported. However, there is a notable lack of implications evidence focused on the impact of the OSCORE on summative decision-making within surgical training programs. In non-surgical specialties, the interpretation/use argument for the OSCORE has not been clearly articulated. The OSCORE has been reduced to a single-item global rating scale, and there is limited validity evidence to support its use in workplace-based assessment. Widespread adoption of the OSCORE must be informed by concurrent data collection in more diverse settings and specialties. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129404859"

Yet mainstream training practices may have the unintended effects of educating for a physician typology that may be too narrow to account for the complexity of learners’ personal identities. Alternative approaches, such as Foucauldian genealogy, offer ways to empirically investigate how the legitimate contours of being and becoming have come to be as they are, how they shape professional identities, and to which degree their borders may be made more inclusive. Drawing upon an example of the contemporary practice of competency-based medical education in the Canadian context, this paper considers how genealogy’s methodological tools of critical distancing, the dispositif, and problematization may help reveal how educational practices shape the identities of physicians-in-training in ways both intended and unintended. From this perspective it becomes apparent that any attempt to explore professional identity is incomplete without also considering that a trainee’s evolving sense of self is inexorably bound up with forces of knowledge, power, and ethics that shape them into becoming certain kinds of physician subjects rather than others. In mapping this terrain, a genealogical approach determines how we reached the now in which we find ourselves and how we might transform it, such that we may shift the possibilities afforded to health professionals to establish professional identities aligned with their personal identities in ways that maximize inclusivity and minimize marginalization. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124272191"

This raises questions as to what kind of expertise professionals need, and how development of this expertise can be influenced within the contexts of both education and work. The terms adaptive expertise and adaptive performance are well-known concepts in the domains of education and Human Resource Development respectively. The literature, however, lacks a conceptual overview. Our research seeks to provide an overview on how adaptive expertise and adaptive performance are conceptualized. In addition we looked for what individual, task and organizational characteristics relate to adaptive expertise. We mined information drawn from existing reviews in an overview of reviews. Nine reviews met the inclusion criteria. Adaptive performance is best referred to as the visible expression of an adaptive expert and this is triggered by ‘change’. The scope of this ‘change’ lies somewhere between change that is ‘new for the learner’ and change that is ‘new for everyone in the whole world’. The extent to and way in which a learner or professional is able to deal with this change depends on the maturity of the learner or professional. We found numerous individual, task and environmental characteristics related to adaptive expertise and adaptive performance. The nature and relation of these characteristics, and their specificity in relation to adaptive expertise and adaptive performance are visualized in a figure, but also provide several suggestions for future research. © 2022, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143210735"

In other countries, work experience is often considered in later admission stages (e.g., interviews with pre-selected subgroups of applicants). However, evidence for its predictive validity for study success in addition to cognitive admission criteria is currently lacking. We therefore assessed whether completed vocational training in a relevant medical profession can predict study performance in the first two years of study in addition to cognitive admission criteria. Admission and study performance data of all currently enrolled medical students at two German medical schools (Göttingen and Heidelberg) beginning with the 2013/14 cohort were retrospectively analyzed. Cognitive admission criteria in our sample were GPA grades and a cognitive test (“Test für Medizinische Studiengänge”, TMS). We defined the study outcome parameter as the mean percentile rank over all performance data points over the first two years of study for each location, respectively. A multi-level model with varying intercepts by location, GPA, TMS, vocational training, and sex as predictors accounted for 14.5% of the variance in study outcome. A positive predictive association with study outcome was found for vocational training (ß = 0.33, p =.008) beyond GPA (ß = 0.38, p <.001) and TMS (ß = 0.26, p <.001). Our results support the use of prior vocational training as a selection criterion for medical studies potentially adding predictive validity to cognitive criteria. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133629267"

Medical students engaged in the pandemic effort, making personal and professional sacrifices. However, the impact of these sacrifices on students` professional development is still unknown. We applied constructivist grounded theory to individual audio diaries (total time = 5h38 min) and interviews (total time = 11h57min) performed with 18 last-year medical students during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. The perspective of making sacrifices caused initial emotional distress in medical students, followed by a negotiation process revolving around three themes: predisposition to sacrifice, sense of competence, and sense of belonging. This negotiation process led to three response patterns: Pattern A: “No sense of duty”–the sacrifice was perceived as meaningless, and students showed intense anger and a desire to flee; Pattern B: “Sense of duty with hesitation to act”–the sacrifice was acknowledged as legitime, but students felt unprepared to contribute, leading to feelings of frustration and shame; and, Pattern C: “Sense of duty with readiness to act”–the engagement with the sacrifice was perceived as an opportunity to grow as a doctor, leading to fulfillment and proudness. Students ready to engage with the COVID-19 effort experienced identity consonance, reinforcing their professional identities. Students who felt incompetent or found the sacrifice meaningless experienced identity dissonance, which led to emotional suffering and the consideration of abandoning the course. Monitoring students' emotional reactions when facing professional challenges creates opportunities to problematize the role of sacrifice in the medical profession and scaffold professional identity development. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143839819"

Less is known, however, about how BSTs perceive their professional identity and what factors influence its formation. This study aims to explore how the professional identity of BSTs is formed and what factors influence this professional identity formation (PIF) using the 4S (“Situation, Self, Support, Strategies”) Schlossberg framework. Method: A qualitative descriptive study using focus groups (FGs) was conducted. Maximum variation sampling was used to purposively select BSTs. A rigorous thematic analysis was completed, including independent thematic analysis, intermittent checking and iterative discussions among researchers, and member checking. Results: Nine FGs, involving 60 teachers, were conducted. The findings highlighted four major themes reflecting the 4S framework: the self as internal driver, early-career events and opportunities, individual and institutional support, and active participation in continuing professional development. Both the “Self” and the “Situation” components prompted the BSTs to utilize supports and enact strategies to become professional teachers. Although the BSTs in this study were primarily internally driven, they relied more on existing support systems rather than engaging in various strategies to support their growth. Conclusion: It is important to address the PIF of BSTs given their dynamic roles. Looking through the lens of the 4S framework, PIF is indeed a transition process. A structured, stepwise faculty development program, including mentorship, reflective practice, and a community of practice designed to foster BSTs’ identities, should be created, taking into consideration the diverse factors influencing the PIF of BSTs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135263826"

The aim of this review was to summarise the evidence for implementation of IPE, and identify challenges and key lessons to guide faculty in IPE implementation. Methods: Five stage scoping review of methodological characteristics, implementation components, challenges and key lessons in primary studies in IPE. Thematic analysis using a framework of micro (teaching), meso (institutional), and macro (systemic) level education factors was used to synthesise challenges and key lessons. Results: Twenty-seven primary studies were included in this review. Studies were predominantly descriptive in design and implementation components inconsistently reported. IPE was mostly integrated into curricula, optional, involved group learning, and used combinations of interactive and didactic approaches. Micro level implementation factors (socialisation issues, learning context, and faculty development), meso level implementation factors (leadership and resources, administrative processes), and macro level implementation factors (education system, government policies, social and cultural values) were extrapolated. Sustainability was identified as an additional factor in IPE implementation. Conclusion: Lack of complete detailed reporting limits evidence of IPE implementation, however, this review highlighted challenges and yielded key lessons to guide faculty in the implementation of IPE. © 2022, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131677955"

To explore its bearing on the MMI method we included a rating of first impression in the MMI for student selection executed 2012 at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany (196 applicants, 26 pairs of raters) and analyzed how it was related to MMI performance ratings made by (a) the same rater, and (b) a different rater. First impression was assessed immediately after an applicant entered the test room. Each MMI-task took 5 min and was rated subsequently. Internal consistency was α =.71 for first impression and α =.69 for MMI performance. First impression and MMI performance correlated by r =.49. Both measures weakly predicted performance in two OSCEs for communication skills, assessed 18 months later. MMI performance did not increment prediction above the contribution of first impression and vice versa. Prediction was independent of whether or not the rater who rated first impression also rated MMI performance. The correlation between first impression and MMI-performance is in line with the results of corresponding social psychological studies, showing that judgements based on minimal information moderately predict behavioral measures. It is also in accordance with the notion that raters often blend their specific assessment task outlined in MMI-instructions with the self-imposed question of whether a candidate would fit the role of a medical doctor. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137458083"

How trainees come to develop this capacity to transfer and transform knowledge across contexts can be described by adaptive expertise, which focuses on the ability of some experts to innovate upon their existing knowledge to develop novel solutions to novel problems. While adaptive expertise is often presented as an alternative framework to more traditional cognitivist and constructivist expertise models, it is unclear whether the non-routine and routine forms of transfer it describes are distinct from those described by other accounts of transfer. Furthermore, whether what (e.g., knowledge) is transferred and how (e.g., cognitive processes) differs between these views is still debated. In this review, we describe various theories of transfer and present a synthesis clarifying the relationship between transfer and adaptive expertise. Informed by our analysis, we argue that the mechanisms of transfer in adaptive expertise share important commonalities with traditional accounts of transfer, which when understood, can complement efforts by educators and researchers to foster and study adaptive expertise. We present three instructional principles that may better support transfer and adaptive expertise in trainees: i) identifying and incorporating meaningful variability in practice, ii) integrating conceptual knowledge during practice iii) using assessments of trainees’ transfer. Taken together, we offer an integrative perspective to how educational systems and experiences can be designed to develop and encourage adaptive expertise and transfer. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141843146"

Residents developing this skill may initially struggle or fail, and require support. However, this experience may prepare residents for future learning which is essential to adaptive expertise. Limited understanding of how residents learn from failure in the workplace restricts the ability to maximize its potential benefits. The purpose of this study was to explore the role failure plays in learning to navigate difficult conversations during workplace learning. A constructivist grounded theory study was conducted using semi-structured interviews of 13 physicians (subspecialty residents and newly graduated physicians) from a Division of Developmental Paediatrics between 2017 and 2018. The authors used constant comparative analysis to identify themes iteratively. Themes were identified both inductively and deductively using the conceptual framework of adaptive expertise. Through independently leading difficult conversations, physicians were able to recognize that the failure that occurred in these encounters, prompted them to generate new knowledge which led to deeper conceptual understanding, thus supporting development of adaptive expertise. However, participants indicated that staff physicians often protect residents from difficult conversations, which limits their opportunity to receive feedback and engage in learning. Residents participate in difficult conversations that challenge them to go beyond their existing knowledge. Providing residents with opportunity to lead difficult conversations with patients and families while being supported by staff supervisors, allows for struggling through learning, which leads to a deeper conceptual understanding and supports development of adaptive expertise. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141385238"

Across three graduating classes, individual growth curves were calculated for each student on National Board of Medical Examiners customized assessments during the pre-clerkship period using their deviation from the class average at each assessment point. These deviation scores were cumulatively summed over time and were regressed onto the sequence of exams. We analyzed the difference between the regression slopes of those students placed on Academic Probation (AP) versus not, as well as differences in slopes based on the timing of when a struggling learner was placed on AP to explore learner trajectory after identification. Students on AP had an average growth slope of − 6.06 compared to + 0.89 for those not on AP. Findings also suggested that students who were placed on AP early during pre-clerkship showed significant improvement (positive changes in trajectory) compared to students identified later in the curriculum. Our findings suggest that earlier academic probation and intervention with struggling learners may have a positive effect on academic trajectory. Future research can better explore how academic trajectory monitoring and performance review can be regularly used in advising sessions with students. © 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128809158"

When learning teamwork, interprofessional students are expected to work patient-centered; recognizing the patient’s expertise and partnering with them. Research on interprofessional education (IPE) for undergraduates has illuminated learning outcomes, organization of learning activities, change in attitudes, etc. But, we know little about the interaction between patients and interprofessional student teams. This study aimed to explore how interprofessional student teams and patients interact in interprofessional clinical placements. With a focused ethnographic approach, participant observation and qualitative interviews were conducted in two contexts; a physical and an online arrangement. Central ideas in Goffman’s dramaturgy constituted a theoretical lens. A reflexive thematic analysis generated three themes: (1) Preparing safe and comfortable encounters with patients, (2) Including and excluding the patient in the encounter, and (3) Adjusting to the patient's situation. We identified students’ intentions of patient-centeredness when preparing encounters, but patients did not always feel included and listened to in encounters. After encountering patients, student teams adjusted their teamwork, by changing the team composition or the planned clinical interventions to better meet the patients’ needs. Notably, team-based patient encounters led to a different view of the patient, their health issues, and how to collaborate. Our findings can inform educators of the importance of addressing patient-centered care in interprofessional learning arrangements. Today, clinical interprofessional placements may not exploit the potential for learning about patient-centeredness. A thematization of this, e.g., in supervision in future clinical placements can ensure an enhanced focus on this in interprofessional teamwork. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141534011"

We aimed to document stakeholders’ knowledge of- and attitudes towards LA, and identify how the supports and barriers can help or hinder the uptake and sustainable use of LA. Methods: We interviewed representatives from four stakeholder groups involved in LA. The interview protocols were based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), which contains a total of 14 behaviour change determinants. Two team members coded the interviews deductively to the TDF, with a third resolving differences in coding. The qualitative data analysis was completed with iterative consultations and discussions with team members until consensus was achieved. Saliency analysis was used to identify dominant domains. Results: Forty-one individuals participated in the study. Three dominant domains were identified. Participants perceive that LA has more positive than negative consequences and requires substantial ressources. All the elements and characteristics of LA are present in our data, with differences between stakeholders. Conclusion: Going forward, we could develop and implement tailored and theory driven interventions to promote a shared understanding of LA, and maintain potential positive outcomes while reducing negative ones. Furthermore, ressources to support LA implementation need to be addressed to facilitate its uptake. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130795450"

Therefore, the cultivation of this ability has been discussed extensively in medical education. One theory suggests that the experience of patienthood can increase empathy among doctors. This theory is supported by previous research that published doctors’ illness narratives. However, the concept of empathy has been ambiguously defined in academic fields, including medicine; therefore, analysing how doctors experience ‘empathy’ in their interactions with patients is difficult. Our research question is how doctors who became patients describe the relationship between their illness experiences and the interactions with patients after their illness. To this end, this paper initially tracks the debates on ‘empathy’ in medicine and other disciplines, to develop a lens for analysing doctors’ illness narratives. Next, we conduct a narrative analysis of illness stories from 18 Japanese medical doctors who became patients. Our analysis supports the traditional idea that an illness can enable a doctor to become more empathetic. However, this is overly simplistic; how doctors experience and subsequently process their illness is more complex. Moreover, this notion can disregard doctors’ suffering in these circumstances, and fail to represent the often-lengthy process of mastering ‘empathy’ based on their experiences. Therefore, our analysis deconstructed the concept of ‘empathy’, showing that it can appear in various ways. Further research is required to elucidate how empathy is cultivated during the process of transformation of doctors’ illnesses, focusing on their communities and practices. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135866107"

While experiences of workplace learning have been extensively investigated, practices of workplace learning explored through field work have been less utilized. The theoretical framework of teaching and learning regimes acknowledges aspects of power and conflict in its consideration of what guides teachers and learners in their practice of workplace learning. This study aimed to explore practices of workplace learning in the two adjacent healthcare professions; medicine and nursing. We adopted an ethnographic qualitative design. Field observations and follow-up interviews were performed in three clinical departments and the data set comprised 12 full days of observations and 16 formal follow-up interviews. Thematic analysis was performed deductively according to the theoretical framework. Four teaching and learning regimes were found in the data. In the medical context, workplace learning was either practiced as reproduction of current practice or through stimulation of professional development. In the nursing context, workplace learning was either based on development of partnership between student and supervisor or on conditional membership in a professional community. The medical and nursing contexts demonstrated varying underpinnings and assumptions relating to teaching and learning. The respective practices of workplace learning in the medical and nursing context appear to hold substantial differences which might have implications for how we understand practices of workplace learning. We further conclude that the theoretical framework of teaching and learning regimes in this study proved useful in exploring workplace learning. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143242439"

It reminds us that people’s lives cannot be explained by taking into account single categories, such as gender, race, sexuality, or socio-economic status. Rather, human lives are multi-dimensional and complex, and people’s lived realities are shaped by different factors and social dynamics operating together. Therefore, when someone occupies multiple marginalized intersections, their individual-level experiences reflect social and structural systems of power, privilege, and inequality. And yet, knowing that people occupy different social locations that afford them unique experiences is not the same as knowing how to analyze data in an intersectional way. Intersectional analyses are rigorous, and require the use of theory at multiple levels to see theoretical connections that are often only implicit. In this paper, we ask “How does one actually do intersectional research and what role does theory play in this process?” In an effort to make intersectionality theory more accessible to health professions education research, this article describes the simpler version of intersectional analyses followed by the more complex version representing how it was originally intended to be used; a means to fight for social justice. Using pilot data collected on first-generation medical students’ professional identity experiences, we demonstrate the thinking and engagement with theory that would be needed to do an intersectional analysis. Along the way, we describe some of the challenges researchers may find in using intersectionality in their own work. By re-situating the theory within its original roots of Black feminist thought, we hope other health professions education (HPE) researchers consider using intersectionality in their own analyses. © 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127561507"

During a second-year undergraduate course, students wrote a one-page essay on an air pollutant. A first cohort (N = 260) relied on analytical rating using criteria to assess their peers’ essays. A total of 1297 evaluations were made, and each essay received at least four peer ratings. Results indicate a small correlation between peer and teacher marks, and three essays of substandard quality were not recognised by the group of peer raters. A second cohort (N = 230) used comparative judgement. They completed 1289 comparisons, from which a rank order was calculated. Results suggest a large correlation between the university teacher marks and the peer scores and acceptable reliability of the rank order. In addition, the three essays of substandard quality were discerned as such by the group of peer raters. Although replication research is warranted, the results provide the first evidence that, when peer raters overmark and fail to identify substandard work using analytical rating with criteria, university teachers may consider changing the rating method of the peer assessment to comparative judgement. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134582449"

Despite the expansive literature on rapid adaptations and innovations, generalisability of these descriptions is limited by scarce use of theory-driven methods. In this research, we explored UK surgical trainees’ (n = 46) and consultant surgeons’ (trainers, n = 25) perceptions of how learning in clinical environments changed during a time of extreme uncertainty (2020/2021). Our ultimate goal was to identify new ideas that could shape post-pandemic surgical training. We conducted semi-structured virtual interviews with participants from a range of working/training environments across thirteen Health Boards in Scotland. Initial analysis of interview transcripts was inductive. Dynamic capabilities theory (how effectively an organisation uses its resources to respond to environmental changes) and its micro-foundations (sensing, seizing, reconfiguring) were used for subsequent theory-driven analysis. Findings demonstrate that surgical training responded dynamically and adapted to external and internal environmental uncertainty. Sensing threats and opportunities in the clinical environment prompted trainers’ institutions to seize new ways of working. Learners gained from reconfigured training opportunities (e.g., splitting operative cases between trainees), pan-surgical working (e.g., broader surgical exposure), redeployment (e.g., to medical specialties), collaborative working (working with new colleagues and in new ways) and supervision (shifting to online supervision). Our data foreground the human resource and structural reconfigurations, and technological innovations that effectively maintained surgical training during the pandemic, albeit in different ways. These adaptations and innovations could provide the foundations for enhancing surgical education and training in the post-pandemic era. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140655718"

Previous authors have recommended eye-tracking technology as a useful approach for collecting data on the processes test taker’s use to respond to test questions. This study proposes a new method for evaluating alternative score interpretations by using eye-tracking data and machine learning. We collect eye-tracking data from 26 students responding to clinical MCQs. Analysis is performed by providing 119 eye-tracking features as input for a machine-learning model aiming to classify correct and incorrect responses. The predictive power of various combinations of features within the model is evaluated to understand how different feature interactions contribute to the predictions. The emerging eye-movement patterns indicate that incorrect responses are associated with working from the options to the stem. By contrast, correct responses are associated with working from the stem to the options, spending more time on reading the problem carefully, and a more decisive selection of a response option. The results suggest that the behaviours associated with correct responses are aligned with the real-world model used for score interpretation, while those associated with incorrect responses are not. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to perform data-driven, machine-learning experiments with eye-tracking data for the purpose of evaluating score interpretation validity. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129407706"

The participants were randomly assigned into three groups: (1) face-to-face mindfulness training based on the Mindfulness Skills for Students course (n = 40), (2) a web-based Student Compass program using Mindfulness and Acceptance and Commitment therapy (n = 22), and (3) a control group that received mental health support as usual (n = 40). The primary outcome was psychological distress measured using the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation Outcome Measure (CORE-OM). Secondary outcomes included hair cortisol concentrations and a wide range of well-being indicators. Psychological distress increased in all the groups from baseline to post-intervention, but significantly less so in the intervention groups than in the control group. At 4-month follow-up, were found no differences between the primary outcomes of the control and intervention groups, but the participants who continued practising mindfulness at least twice a week were less stressed than the others.

However, students often report that they experience a passive observer role, and further research on contextual factors that influence student participation is needed. The theory of practice architectures contributes a new perspective to this challenge by elucidating how cultural-discursive, material-economic, and social-political arrangements enable and constrain student participation in clinical work. The aim of this study was to explore how practice architectures in clinical learning environments enable and constrain medical students’ participation. The study was designed as an ethnographic field study in three student clinics: 106 h of observation. Analysis comprised ethnographic analysis followed by application of the theory of practice architectures. The ethnographic analysis resulted in six themes: setting the scene, when to call for help, my room – my patient, getting in a routine, I know something you don’t, and my work is needed. Applying the theory of practice architectures showed that material-economic arrangements, such as control of the consultation room and essential artefacts, were crucial to student participation and position in the clinical workplace. Furthermore, co-production of a student mandate to independently perform certain parts of a consultation enabled a co-productive student position in the hierarchy of care-producers. The findings offer a conceptually generalisable model for the study of material and social dimensions of clinical learning environments. Although not all clinical learning environments may wish to or have the resources to implement a student clinic, the findings offer insights into general issues about the arrangements of student participation relevant to most clinical teaching contexts. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140512665"

We carried out a theory-driven systematic review with the aim to (1) provide an overview of key characteristics of training initiatives and pedagogical features, and (2) analyze barriers and facilitators to implementing this training in medical education. We used queer theory to contextualize our findings. We searched the PubMed/Ovid MEDLINE database (October 2009 to December 2021) for original studies that reported on transgender content within medical schools and residency programs (N = 46). We performed a thematic analysis to identify training characteristics, pedagogical features, barriers and facilitators. Most training consisted of single-session interventions, with varying modes of delivery. Most interventions were facilitated by instructors with a range of professional experience and half covered general LGBT+-content. Thematic analysis highlighted barriers including lack of educational materials, lack of faculty expertise, time/costs constraints, and challenges in recruiting and compensating transgender guest speakers. Facilitators included scaffolding learning throughout the curriculum, drawing on expertise of transgender people and engaging learners in skills-based training. Sustainable implementation of transgender-health objectives in medical education faces persistent institutional barriers. These barriers are rooted in normative biases inherent to biomedical knowledge production, and an understanding of categories of sex and gender as uncomplicated. Medical schools should facilitate trans-inclusive educational strategies to combat transgender-health inequities, which should include a critical stance toward binary conceptualizations of sex and gender throughout the curriculum. © 2022, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128072269"

Health settings' demanding and competitive nature imposes unique challenges on students and clinicians with disabilities. This paper aims to explore the trajectories and experiences of social support interactions amongst students and clinicians with disabilities in health professions. In a qualitative longitudinal study, 124 in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 27 health students and 29 health clinicians with disabilities. Data analysis was informed by grounded theory as an adapted analytic approach involving constant comparisons. A few main characteristics of social support and trajectories in which social support is negotiated emerged from the data: (1) The need to be accepted and not questioned when asking for support, (2) Support interactions that do not heighten otherness, (3) Failure to acknowledge the challenges, (4) Interactions that support the process of disclosure (5) Interactions that allow mobilization of social support without strain or an extra effort. These findings have important implications for designing more supportive health professions, educational programs, and workplaces for people living with disabilities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141000793"

Current literature provides general suggestions about types of teacher interventions. Our study aims to specify that knowledge by describing in detail the actions teachers do when intervening, the interactional consequences of those actions, and how these relate to teacher roles in group discussions. We collected all first teacher interventions (n = 142) in 41 videorecorded group discussions on experiences from practice at the Dutch postgraduate training for General Practice. We analyzed the interventions using Conversation Analysis. First, we described the timing, manner, actions, and interactional consequences of each intervention. Next, we inductively categorized actions into types of actions. Finally, we analyzed the distribution of these types of actions over the group discussion phases (telling, exploration, discussion, conclusion). First teacher interventions were done at observably critical moments. Actions done by these interventions could be categorized as moderating, expert, and evaluating actions. Moderating actions, commonly done during the telling and exploration phase, are least directive. Expert and evaluator actions, more common in the discussion phase, are normative and thus more directive. The placement and form of the actions done by teachers, as well as their accounts for doing those, may hint at a teacher orientation to intervene as late as possible. Since the interventions are occasioned by prior interaction and responded to in different ways by residents, they are a collaborative interactional accomplishment. Our detailed description of how, when and with what effect teachers intervene provides authentic material for teacher training. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132136346"

To date, there has been no recognition of an African influence on PIF, which is crucial for understanding this phenomenon in places like South Africa, a society in which the inequity of the apartheid era still prevails. In addition, there is little data examining how social upheaval could impact PIF. This study uses interviews with medical students to explore PIF within the context of social upheaval during the 2015–2016 protests that rocked South Africa when students challenged asymmetries of power and privilege that persisted long after the country’s democratic transition. The combination of the primary author’s autoethnographic story, weaved into the South African sociohistorical context and ubuntu philosophy, contributes to this study of PIF in the South African context. The use of an African metaphor allowed the reorientation of PIF to reflect the influence of an ubuntu-based value system. Using the calabash as a metaphor, participants’ experiences were framed and organized in two ways: a calabash worldview and the campus calabash. The calabash worldview is a multidimensional mixture of values that include ubuntu, reflections of traditional childhoods, and the image of women as igneous rocks, which recognizes the power and influence on PIF of the women who raised the participants. Introducing an African ubuntu-based perspective into the PIF discourse may redirect the acknowledgement of context and local reality in developing professional identity. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140830035"

Within this environment, student placements are often perceived as an additional burden to an already overwhelmed workforce. This study explored whether the quality of patient care was enhanced when services were re-designed using a collaborative partnership approach to more purposefully integrate students into delivery of care. Using an embedded multiple case study design, data were collected through focus groups and interviews, patient experience surveys, and secondary administrative data sources. Cases were across physiotherapy and occupational therapy in six different hospital settings. Perception of care provided by students was viewed positively by all stakeholders, including patients. Perceived health outcomes of faster improvement of health condition, improved mobility and function identified through our qualitative findings were supported by quantitative service delivery markers such as increased therapy sessions, more patients being discharged home instead of to other care facilities and reduced length of stay. Health care providers and students alike perceived improvements in service efficiencies whilst maintaining high quality care. This study has provided preliminary evidence towards improved patient care when a partnering approach is adopted whereby students are intentionally integrated into services that otherwise might not have been delivered. Furthermore, it has shifted the associated narrative from students as additional burden to students as benefit. © 2022, Crown.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142221654"

To inform the development of skills-based curricula addressing IBRM, we conducted a scoping review of the literature inquiring, “What interventions exist focused on IBRM in professions related to social determinants of health: education, law, social work, and the health professions inclusive of nursing, allied health professions, and medicine?”Authors searched eight databases for articles published from 2000 to 2020. Included studies: (1) described interventions related to implicit bias; and (2) addressed knowledge, attitude and/or skills as outcomes. Excluded were interventions solely focused on reducing/neutralizing implicit bias. Article review for inclusion and data charting occurred independently and in duplicate. Investigators compared characteristics across studies; data charting focused on educational and assessment strategies. Fifty-one full-text articles for data charting and synthesis, with more than 6568 learners, were selected. Educational strategies included provocative/engagement triggers, the Implicit Association Test, reflection and discussion, and various active learning strategies. Most assessments were self-report, with fewer objective measures. Eighteen funded studies utilized federal, foundation, institutional, and private sources. This review adds to the literature by providing tangible examples of curricula to complement existing frameworks, and identifying opportunities for further research in innovative skills-based instruction, learner assessment, and development and validation of outcome metrics. Continued research addressing IBRM would enable learners to develop and practice skills to recognize and manage their implicit biases during clinical encounters, thereby advancing the goal of improved, equitable patient outcomes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144173374"

However, little is known about how students develop their cultural competence during their training. This ethnographic case study combined participant observation with interviews and focus group to understand students’ views and experiences in developing their cultural competence during clinical placements. The results show that students’ development of cultural competence is an individually varied process via four distinctive yet interrelated learning avenues. Immersion in a diverse healthcare environment contributes to students’ development of cultural awareness and knowledge. Observation of culturally appropriate or inappropriate practices allows students to enhance their practical skills and critical reflection. Interaction with other clinical professionals, patients, and their family members, enables students’ engagement within the busy clinical practice. Reflection helps students to actively think about culture’s impact on health and internalize the importance of cultural competence. Students’ learning via each avenue is interrelated and constantly interacting with their learning environment, which collectively contributes to their development. Integrating the results allowed the authors to generate a theoretical model that conceptualizes medical students’ cultural competence development in clinical placements, which unearths students’ cultural learning within the informal and hidden curriculum. This study provides a rare view of students’ development of cultural competence in clinical placements, which may inform the pedagogic development of cultural competence and diversity education in medicine and healthcare. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141703409"

PIF is crafted by socialization within a CoP including transfer of tacit knowledge. While certain tacit knowledge is critical for professional identity, we understand little how it shapes PIF. We set out to describe the tacit knowledge acquired by new attendings within a CoP and how it contributes to PIF. Informed by constructivist grounded theory, we interviewed 23 new attendings about the tacit knowledge they acquired in early practice. Data collection and analysis occurred iteratively. We identified themes using constant comparative analysis and generated a theory that underwent member checking and feedback. Implicit standards from group culture imparted high expectations on new attendings and led to internal stress. New attendings also encountered a tacit code of conduct as behavioral elements of group culture. These elements created external conflict between new attendings and group members such as departmental colleagues, consulting physicians, and other health professionals. Depending on the support they received, new attendings responded to the stress and conflict in three ways: they doubted, adjusted, or avoided. These strategies molded their professional identity, and moved them towards or away from the CoP as they navigated their transition and PIF. We describe a novel theory of how tacit group culture shaped new attending physicians’ professional identity in a new community of practice. Internal stress and external conflict occurred due to high expectations and tacit culture elements. New attendings’ doubt, adjust, or avoid responses, shaped by support they received, in turn crafted their professional identity. Education leaders should prepare graduating trainees to navigate aspects of transition to independent practice successfully. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143652138"

We conducted a literature search and scoping review exploring the demographic characteristics of Twitter influencers in academic medicine. Included studies evaluated Twitter influence by any metric and reported associated demographic characteristics. There were no date or language restrictions. Data points included metrics of influence, demographics, and study characteristics. From 1656 records, thirteen met inclusion criteria. Influence was variably defined based on followers, measures of centrality, measures of engagement, or through third-party software. Studies were conducted at single time points and relied heavily on facial recognition for classification of sex or gender, with no studies exploring race as a variable of interest. Twitter influencers in academic medicine were found to be disproportionately male: significantly fewer influencers were female at all levels of professional status. Two studies identified more female influencers among trainee populations. Female users were less likely to develop influence based on followers, retweets, likes, or other measures of engagement at academic meetings, despite equal or greater representation at these meetings. Results on associations between Twitter influence and number of publications or h-index varied considerably. No included studies explored race or ethnicity in relation to Twitter influence, which presents a significant gap in the literature. Our findings highlight the need for larger, user-engaged studies of inequities related to social media influence in academic medicine, especially as social media is increasingly incorporated into academic portfolios. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146231241"

Our main thesis is that all skilled movement reflects components of adaptive expertise. Through an overview of perspectives from the field of motor control and learning, we emphasize the interplay between the inherent noisiness of the human motor architecture and the stability of motor skill performances. Ultimately, we challenge the very idea of routine. Our goal is threefold: to reconcile common misconceptions about the rote nature of routine precision skill performance, to offer educators principles to enhance adaptive expertise as an outcome of precision skill training, and to expand the conversation between ‘routine’ and ‘adaptive’ forms of expertise in health professions education. © 2022, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142449215"

So widespread is this perspective that Likert-style inventories are now routinely administered to students to quantify how much a given course or curriculum evokes deep learning. The predictive validity of these inventories, however, has been criticized based on sparse empirical support and ambiguity in what specific outcome measures indicate whether deep learning has occurred. Here we further tested the predictive validity of a prevalent deep learning inventory, the Revised Two-Factor Study Process Questionnaire, by selectively analyzing outcome measures that reflect a major goal of medical education—i.e., knowledge transfer. Students from two undergraduate health sciences courses completed the deep learning inventory before their course’s final exam. Shortly after, a random subset of students rated how much each final exam item aligned with three task demands associated with transfer: (1) application of general principles, (2) integration of multiple ideas or examples, and (3) contextual novelty. We then used these ratings from students to examine performance on a subset of exam items that were collectively perceived to demand transfer. Despite good reliability, the resulting transfer outcomes were not substantively predicted by the deep learning inventory. These findings challenge the validity of this tool and others like it. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135838186"

This study introduced dental students to two diagnostic aids with contrasting reasoning approaches—ORAD DDx, which uses an analytic, forward reasoning approach, and a Radiographic Atlas, which emphasizes a non-analytic, backward reasoning approach. We compared the effectiveness of ORAD DDx and the Atlas in improving students’ diagnostic accuracy and their ability to recall features of radiographic lesions. Participants (99 third-year dental students) were assigned to ORAD DDx, Atlas and Control groups. In the pre-test and post-test, participants provided their diagnosis for eight types of radiographic lesions. All groups also completed a Cued Recall Test. Feedback about ORAD DDx and the Atlas was collected. Results indicated that the Atlas was more effective than ORAD DDx in improving diagnostic accuracy (Estimated marginal mean difference = 1.88 (95% CI 0.30–3.46), p = 0.014, Cohen’s d = 0.714). Participants in the Atlas group also outperformed the Control group in the recall of the lesions’ radiographic features (Estimated marginal mean difference = 3.42 (95% CI 0.85–5.99), p = 0.005, Cohen’s d = 0.793). Students reported that both ORAD DDx and Atlas increased their confidence and decreased the mental effort required to develop differential diagnosis (p ≤ 0.001). This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a non-analytic approach in interpreting dental radiographs among novice learners through the novel use of diagnostic aids. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135269166"

Epistemic injustice is both the immediate discrediting of an individual’s knowledge based on their social identity and the act of persistently ignoring possibilities for other ways of knowing. Using critical narrative interviews and personal reflections over an eight-month period, 22 women students during their first year of medical school described instances when their knowledge and experience was discredited and ignored, then the ways they enacted agency to redress these injustices. Participants described three distinct ways they worked to redress injustices: reclaiming why they belong in medicine, speaking up and calling out the curriculum, and uplifting one another.

Our specific focus in this article is incorporating the digital into ethnography. Digital technologies are pervasively and increasingly shaping the way we interact, behave, think, and communicate as health professions educators and learners. Understanding the contemporary culture(s) of HPE thus means paying attention to what goes on in digital spaces. In this paper, we critically consider some of the potential issues when the field of ethnography exists outside the space time continuum, including the need to engage with theory in research about technology and digital spaces in HPE. After a very brief review of the few HPE studies that have used digital ethnography, we scrutinize what can be gained when ethnography encompasses the digital world, particularly in relation to untangling sociomaterial aspects of HPE. We chart the shifts inherent in conducting ethnographic research within the digital landscape, specifically those related to research field, the role of the researcher and ethical issues. We then use two examples to illustrate possible HPE research questions and potential strategies for using digital ethnography to answer those questions: using digital tools in the conduct of an ethnographic study and how to conduct an ethnography of a digital space. We conclude that acknowledging the pervasiveness of technologies in the design, delivery and experiences of HPE opens up new research questions which can be addressed by embracing the digital in ethnography. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128864184"

For adaptive expertise to flourish, individuals and teams must embrace both efficiency and adaptation. While some industries do it readily, others continue to struggle with the tension between efficiency and adaptation, particularly when otherwise stable situations are unexpectedly disrupted. For instance, in healthcare settings, the efficiency mandate for strict compliance with scopes of practice can deter teams from using the adaptive strategy of making their members interchangeable. Yet, interchangeability has been hinted as a key capacity of today’ teams that are required to navigate fluid team structures. Because interchangeability – as an adaptive strategy – can generate antagonistic reactions, it has not been well studied in fluid teams. Thus, in this exploratory qualitative study we sought to gain insights into how interchangeability manifests when fluid teams from five different contexts (healthcare, emergency services, orchestras, military, and business) deal with disruptive events. According to our participants, successful interchangeability was possible when people knew how to work within one’s role while being aware of their teammates’ roles. However, interchangeability included more than just role switching. Interchangeability took various forms and was most successful when teams capitalized on the procedural, emotional, and social dimensions of their work. To reflect this added complexity, we refer to interchangeability in fluid teams as Ecological Interchangeability. We suggest that ecological interchangeability may become a desired feature in the training of adaptive expertise in teams, if its underlying properties and enabling mechanisms are more fully understood. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141738696"

Studies on the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic have largely focused on students’ learning and well-being. In contrast, little is known about how emergency online teaching affects teachers. The aim of this study was to examine how disrupted teaching contexts during the Covid-19 pandemic affected academic teacher identities in health science education. Interviews were conducted with 19 experienced lecturers in health science education from two universities. Interview data were analysed using systematic text condensation. The established codes were compared across interviews to identify common themes and subsequently synthesized into descriptions of the emerging phenomena. Findings indicated that a form of embodied teacher identity, i.e. internalized teaching practices turned into dispositions, constituted a basic pedagogical condition and a resource for the teachers, and that the sudden change in the teaching context caused a loss of teacher identity. This identity loss was related to an incorporated understanding and use of the teacher’s sense of the classroom (subtheme 1), non-verbal feedback from students (subtheme 2) and reciprocal visual contact (subtheme 3). Data also indicated that teachers’ ability to adapt their teaching to students’ needs while teaching and teachers’ motivation and job satisfaction may have suffered. Universities should carefully consider how to cultivate sustainable and adaptive teacher identities compatible with the increasing digitalization of learning environments. Teaching is an embodied affair, and teacher identities are sensitive to structural changes in teaching contexts. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125527391"

Empirical studies of professional identity in post-registration health professionals were examined with health profession, career stage, background to research, theoretical underpinnings and constructs of professional identity being extracted, charted and analysed using content analysis where relevant. From 9941 studies, 160 studies across 17 health professions were identified, with nursing and medicine most common. Twenty studies focussed on professional identity in the five years post-entry to the workforce and 56 studies did not state career stage. The most common background for the research was the impact of political, social and healthcare reforms and advances. Thirty five percent of studies (n = 57) stated the use of a theory or framework of identity, the most common being classified as social theories. Individual constructs of professional identity across the research were categorised into five themes—The Lived Experience of Professional Identity; The World Around Me; Belonging; Me; and Learning and Qualifications. Descriptions of professional identity are broad, varied, rich and multi-layered however the literature is under theorised with current theories potentially inadequate to capture its complexity and make meaningful contributions to the allied health professions. © 2022, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141572660"

The literature on this issue relies heavily on retrospective collection of decisions, resulting in the risk of inaccurate information regarding what actually drives raters’ perceptions. Capturing in-the-moment information about supervisors’ impressions could yield better insight into how to intervene. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to gather “real-time” judgments to explore what drives preceptors’ judgments of student performance. We performed a prospective study in which physicians were asked to adjust a rating scale in real-time while watching two video-recordings of trainee clinical performances. Scores were captured in 1-s increments, examined for frequency, direction, and magnitude of adjustments, and compared to assessors’ final entrustability judgment as measured by the modified Ottawa Clinic Assessment Tool. The standard deviation in raters’ judgment was examined as a function of time to determine how long it takes impressions to begin to vary. 20 participants viewed 2 clinical vignettes. Considerable variability in ratings was observed with different behaviours triggering scale adjustments for different raters. That idiosyncrasy occurred very quickly, with the standard deviation in raters’ judgments rapidly increasing within 30 s of case onset. Particular moments appeared to generally be influential, but their degree of influence still varied. Correlations between the final assessment and (a) score assigned upon first adjustment of the scale, (b) upon last adjustment, and (c) the mean score, were r = 0.13, 0.32, and 0.57 for one video and r = 0.30, 0.50, and 0.52 for the other, indicating the degree to which overall impressions reflected accumulation of raters’ idiosyncratic moment-by-moment observations. Our results demonstrated that variability in raters’ impressions begins very early in a case presentation and is associated with different behaviours having different influence on different raters. More generally, this study outlines a novel methodology that offers a new path for gaining insight into factors influencing assessor judgments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142891692"

The standardised nature of OSCEs and their alignment with regulatory accountability assure their wide use as high-stakes assessment in medical education. Research into examiner behaviours has predominantly explored the desirable psychometric characteristics of OSCEs, or investigated examiners’ judgements from a cognitive rather than a sociocultural perspective. This study applies cultural historical activity theory (CHAT) to address this gap in exploring examiners’ judgements in a high-stakes OSCE. Based on the idea that OSCE examiners’ judgements are socially constructed and mediated by their clinical roles, the objective was to explore the sociocultural factors that influenced examiners’ judgements of student competence and use the findings to inform examiner training to enhance assessment practice. Seventeen semi-structured interviews were conducted with examiners who assessed medical student competence in progressing to the next stage of training in a large-scale OSCE at one Australian university. The initial thematic analysis provided a basis for applying CHAT iteratively to explore the sociocultural factors and, specifically, the contradictions created by interactions between different elements such as examiners and rules, thus highlighting the factors influencing examiners’ judgements. The findings indicated four key factors that influenced examiners’ judgements: examiners’ contrasting beliefs about the purpose of the OSCE; their varying perceptions of the marking criteria; divergent expectations of student competence; and idiosyncratic judgement practices. These factors were interrelated with the activity systems of the medical school’s assessment practices and the examiners’ clinical work contexts. Contradictions were identified through the guiding principles of multi-voicedness and historicity. The exploration of the sociocultural factors that may influence the consistency of examiners’ judgements was facilitated by applying CHAT as an analytical framework. Reflecting upon these factors at organisational and system levels generated insights for creating fit-for-purpose examiner training to enhance assessment practice. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135862000"

Interpersonal communication is a vital paramedic skill, with evidence demonstrating it leads to improved patient outcomes and satisfaction and reduces medical errors. Interpersonal communication is a core capability set by paramedicine regulatory bodies, and it is the responsibility of accredited universities to ensure graduates are ready for industry and possess all required skills and attributes. In order to be included in this scoping review, all articles were required to meet a pre-determined ‘population, concept, context’ (PCC) framework. The population was undergraduate paramedic students within the context of their undergraduate paramedicine programs, and the concept was interpersonal communication education/teaching/training. In June 2021, a search was conducted using CINAHL, Medline, Emcare and ERIC. The articles had to be written in English and published between 2011 and 2021 and non-research sources were excluded. 176 articles were identified in this search and after screening for duplicates and relevancy, 15 articles were found to be eligible. The literature highlighted 4 key themes, including graduate perception of ‘work readiness’, and a variety of learning experiences including alternative work integrated learning (WIL), interactions with specific patient groups and professional learning experiences. The literature demonstrated that interpersonal communication skills are fostered through human interactions, WIL and simulation, within undergraduate paramedicine programs. Findings from the literature review indicate that practising communication through human interactions, afford an increase in confidence, awareness of ability and empathy, and an increased awareness of preconceived biases. Intraprofessional and interprofessional simulation teaching methods demonstrate the potential to build students confidence in communication and awareness of what is required to function well in a team. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134549515"

To address this issue, accreditation and registration bodies for a number of health professions, such as social work and nursing, have advocated for increasing the test score requirements for university English language entry. However, from a sociolinguistic perspective, decisions concerning ways to address communication challenges need to take into account the unique communication skills required for functioning in specific workplace settings. It is therefore essential to identify the types of communication issues occurring during work-integrated learning opportunities (e.g. placement) and to then assess whether these should be addressed by raising general English proficiency or providing structured learning opportunities for profession-specific communication development within the course content. The present study uses sociolinguistic theory to examine placement educators’ perspectives on international students’ communication issues using the context of social work placement. It draws on the thematic analysis of interviews with 15 placement educators in Australia. One major finding is that international students’ general proficiency or ability to use specific linguistic tools (pragmalinguistic competence) is not a key area of concern for educators. The main challenge seems to involve the students’ understanding of sociocultural norms underlying workplace communication (sociopragmatic competence). This finding suggests that, rather than increasing English language entry requirements, universities need to provide international students opportunities to develop their sociopragmatic competence both before and during placement. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations aimed at supporting international students who speak English as an additional language to develop their workplace communication during their studies. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136945205"

This scoping review sought to describe the learning experiences that may support the development of an interprofessional identity, providing direction for future research. A scoping review was conducted to identify papers published between 2000 and 2020 that provided empiric evidence to support the impact of planned or spontaneous learning experiences involving two or more healthcare professions that fostered the development of an “interprofessional identity,” or a sense of belonging to an interprofessional community. Twelve papers were identified for inclusion. Articles varied regarding both the professional groups studied and the developmental levels of their participants. A wide variety of learning experiences were described in the identified studies, including designed activities and programs, as well as those occurring spontaneously in authentic clinical environments. Examples of longitudinal and integrated programs were also identified. The construct of an interprofessional identity and its potential impact on interprofessional practice has yet to be sufficiently studied. The results of this scoping review suggest that a variety of experiences that occur throughout the professional development trajectory may foster an interprofessional identity. Longitudinal, integrated interprofessional learning programs may result in a more long-lasting impact on interprofessional identity and these types of programs should be the focus of future research. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144352690"

However, the effects of such training programs on students’ metacognitive knowledge, use of learning strategies, and academic performance in the longer term are unknown. In the present study, all first-year pharmacology students from one university attended a learning strategy training program, i.e., the ‘Study Smart program’, in their first weeks. The 20% (n = 25) lowest scoring students on the first midterm received further support regarding their learning strategies. Results showed that all students gained accurate metacognitive knowledge about (in)effective learning strategies in the short- and long-term and reported to use less highlighting, less rereading, but more interleaving, elaboration, and distributed practice after the training program. Academic performance was compared to the prior cohort, which had not received the Study Smart program. While in the previous cohort, students in the top, middle, and bottom rank of midterm 1 stayed in these ranks and still differed significantly in the final exam, students in the Study Smart cohort that received the training program improved throughout the year and differences between ranks were significantly reduced.

To address this need, adaptive expertise has been suggested as an important framework for health professions education. However, research has yet to explore the relationship between workplace learning and adaptive expertise. This study sought to investigate how clinical supervision might support the development of adaptive expertise. The present study used a focused ethnography in two emergency departments. We observed 75 supervising situations with the 27 residents resulting in 116 pages of field notes. The majority of supervision was provided by senior physicians, but also included other healthcare professionals. We found that supervision could serve two purposes: closure and discovery. Supervision aimed at discovery included practices that reflected instructional approaches said to promote adaptive expertise, such as productive struggle. Supervision aimed at closure-included practices with instructional approaches deemed important for efficient and safe patient care, such as verifying information. Our results suggest that supervision is a shared practice and responsibility. We argue that setting and aligning expectations before engaging in supervision is important. Furthermore, results demonstrated that supervision was a dynamic process, shifting between both orientations, and that supervision aimed at discovery could be an an appropriate mode of supervision, even in the most demanding clinical situations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142442030"

The current societal and systemic context is primed for both AE and RP. Both bodies of work position practitioners as agentive, learning continually and thoughtfully throughout their careers, particularly in order to manage unprecedented situations well. Similar on the surface, the roots and practices of AE and RP diverge at key junctures and we will focus on RP’s movement toward critically reflective practice. The roots of AE and RP, and how they relate to or diverge from present-day applications matter because in health professions education, as in all education, paradigmatic mixing should be undertaken purposefully. This paper will explore the need for AE and RP, their shared commitments, distinctive histories, pedagogical possibilities both individually and combined, and next steps for maximizing their potential to positively impact the field. We argue that this exploration is urgently needed because both AE and RP hold much promise for improving health care and yet employing them optimally—whether alone or together—requires understanding and intent. We build an interprofessional education case situated in long-term care, throughout the paper, to demonstrate the potential that AE and RP might offer to health professions education individually and combined. This exploration comes just in time. Within the realities of uncertain practice emphasized by the pandemic, practitioners were also called to act in response to complex and urgent social movements. A combined AE and RP approach, with focus on critically reflective practice in particular, would potentially prepare professionals to respond effectively, compassionately, and equitably to future health and social crises and challenges. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141559126"

Though scholarly practice is included in most competency frameworks, it is unclear what scholarly practice is, how it develops and how it is operationalized in clinical practice. The aim of this review was to determine what is known about scholarly practice in healthcare professionals. We conducted a scoping review and searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL from inception to May 2020. We included papers that explored, described, or defined scholarly practice, scholar or scholarly practitioner, and/or related concepts in healthcare professionals. We included a total of 90 papers. Thirty percent of papers contained an explicit definition of scholarly practice. Conceptualizations of scholarly practice were organized into three themes: the interdependent relationship between scholarship and practice; advancing the profession’s field; and core to being a healthcare practitioner. Attributes of scholarly practitioners clustered around five themes: commitment to excellence in practice; collaborative nature; presence of virtuous characteristics; effective communication skills; and adaptive change ethos. No single unified definition of scholarly practice exists within the literature. The variability in terms used to describe scholarly practice suggests that it is an overarching concept rather than a definable entity. There are similarities between scholarly practitioners and knowledge brokers regarding attributes and how scholarly practice is operationalized. Individuals engaged in the teaching, research and/or assessment of scholarly practice should make explicit their definitions and expectations for healthcare professionals. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143236501"

Many academic institutions employ such scholars to support development and innovation in education. Simultaneously, the possibilities to obtain a PhD degree in HPE are expanding. Clarity in the expectations that such a degree brings along can be useful for scholars, employers and institutions. Anticipating that the views of what a PhD in HPE is or should be can vary between institutions, cultures and countries, we conducted an international Delphi study to identify EPAs for HPE PhDs. We used a framework of 24 EPAs resulted from a national consensus study in Iran as input to seek more generalized validity and a wider consensus of reasonably suitable activities. A three-round modified Delphi study was conducted with participation of 15 international experts. Final framework consisted of 17 relevant EPAs with a justification, specifications and limitations, and risks in case of failure per EPA (all had overall CVI > 0.8 for adequacy of description). Eleven EPAs were considered by the majority to be core to PhD training, 16 to be desirable for HPE PhDs as a capability to carry out without supervision, but the majority would trust current HPE PhDs to carry out only 5 of the 17 without supervision. The EPAs identified in this study arguably reflect the expectations of educators with a PhD degree in HPE. The framework has the potential to advance HPE training across countries and to inform personal development and employment decisions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134329172"

While there have been conversations in the literature regarding the potential of this approach, only recently has the conversation begun to explore the actual experiences of clinical faculty in this process. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the process of EPA assessment for faculty in everyday practice. We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with Anesthesia faculty at a Canadian academic center. Participants were asked to describe how they engage in EPA assessment in daily practice and the factors they considered. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analysed using the constant comparative method of grounded theory. Participants in this study perceived two sources of tension in the EPA assessment process that influenced their scoring on official forms: the potential constraints of the assessment forms and the potential consequences of their assessment outcome. This was particularly salient in circumstances of uncertainty regarding the learner’s level of competence. Ultimately, EPA assessment in CBME may be experienced as higher-stakes by faculty than officially recognized due to these tensions, suggesting a layer of discomfort and burden in the process that may potentially interfere with the goal of assessment for learning. Acknowledging and understanding the nature of this burden and identifying strategies to mitigate it are critical to achieving the assessment goals of CBME. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136785883"

However, it is unclear whether the procedure can also be learned and thereby autonomously applied when diagnosing future cases without instructions to reflect. We investigated whether general practice residents would learn the deliberate reflection procedure through ‘learning-by-teaching’ and apply it to diagnose new cases. The study was a two-phase experiment. In the learning phase, 56 general-practice residents were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. They either (1) studied examples of deliberate reflection and then explained the procedure to a fictitious peer on video; or (2) solved cases without reflection (control). In the test phase, one to three weeks later, all participants diagnosed new cases while thinking aloud. The analysis of the test phase showed no significant differences between the conditions on any of the outcome measures (diagnostic accuracy, p =.263; time to diagnose, p =.598; mental effort ratings, p =.544; confidence ratings, p =.710; proportion of contradiction units (i.e. measure of deliberate reflection), p =.544). In contrast to findings on learning-by-teaching from other domains, teaching deliberate reflection to a fictitious peer, did not increase reflective reasoning when diagnosing future cases. Potential explanations that future research might address are that either residents in the experimental condition did not apply the learned deliberate reflection procedure in the test phase, or residents in the control condition also engaged in reflection. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135253148"

Under borderline regression, the standard within a station is set using checklist/domain scores and global grades acting in combination. This complexity requires a more nuanced view of what stringency might mean when considering sources of variation of cut-scores in stations. This study uses data from 349 administrations of an 18-station, 36 candidate single circuit OSCE for international medical graduates wanting to practice in the UK (PLAB2). The station-level data was gathered over a 34-month period up to July 2019. Linear mixed models are used to estimate and then separate out examiner (n = 547), station (n = 330) and examination (n = 349) effects on borderline regression cut-scores. Examiners are the largest source of variation in cut-scores accounting for 56% of variance in cut-scores, compared to 6% for stations, < 1% for exam and 37% residual. Aggregating to the exam level tends to ameliorate this effect. For 96% of examinations, a ‘fair’ cut-score, equalising out variation in examiner stringency that candidates experience, is within one standard error of measurement (SEM) of the actual cut-score. The addition of the SEM to produce the final pass mark generally ensures the public is protected from almost all false positives in the examination caused by examiner cut-score stringency acting in candidates’ favour. © 2020, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090208398"

At the root of abduction lies a fundamental debate: How do we connect practice, which is always singular and unique, with theory, which describes the world in terms of rules, generalizations, and universals? While abduction was initially seen as the ‘poor cousin’ of deduction and induction, ultimately it has something important to tell us about the role of imagination and humility in theorizing Health Professions Education. It is that which makes theory possible, because it allows us to ask what might be the case and calls attention to the role of creative leaps in theory. Becoming aware of the abductive reasoning we already perform in our research allows us to take the role of imagination—something rarely associated with theory—seriously. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108087391"

Deeper understanding of clinicians’ research-related motivation may better foster their sustained research engagement post-training and, by extension, the advancement of medicine and health outcomes. This study used an integrated theoretical framework (Social Cognitive Career Theory and Professional Identity Formation) and appreciative inquiry to explore the interplay of professional identification and research context in shaping post-training research success narratives. To foreground professional identification, 19 research-active clinicians and 17 basic scientists served as interviewees. A multi-institutional, multi-national design was used to explore how contextual factors shape external valuation of research success. The findings suggest that research-active clinicians do not identify as the career scientists implied by the modern physician-scientist construct and the goal of many clinician research-training programs. Their primary identification as care providers shapes their definition of research success around extending their clinical impact; institutional expectations and prevailing healthcare concerns that value this aim facilitate their sustained research engagement. Integrated developmental and organizational interventions adaptive to research context and conducive to a wider range of medical inquiry may better leverage clinicians’ direct involvement in patient care and advance progress toward human health and well-being. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089824145"

Consequently, many evaluative studies focus on summative program outcomes without accompanying evaluations of implementation. This runs the risk of Type III errors, whereby outcome evaluations rest on unverified assumptions about the appropriate implementation of prescribed curricular activities. Such errors challenge the usefulness of the evaluative studies, casting doubt on accumulated knowledge about curricular innovations, and posing problems for educational systems working to mobilize scarce resources. Unfortunately, however, there is long-standing inattention to the evaluation of implementation in health professions education (HPE). To address this, we propose an accessible framework that provides substantive guidance for evaluative research on implementation of curricular innovations. The Prescribed-Intended-Enacted-Sustainable (PIES) framework that is articulated in this paper, introduces new concepts to HPE—with a view to facilitating more nuanced examination of the evolution of curricula as they are implemented. Critically, the framework is theoretically grounded, integrating evaluation and implementation science as well as education theory. It outlines when, how, and why evaluators need to direct attention to curricular implementation, providing guidance on how programs can map out meaningful evaluative research agendas. Ultimately, this work is intended to support evaluators and educators, seeking to design evaluation studies that provide more faithful, useful representations of the intricacies of curricular change implementation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119056979"

Academic medical organizations have attempted to increase broader representation while seeking structural reforms consistent with the goal of enhancing equity and reducing disproportionality. However, efforts remain constrained while minority groups continue to experience discrimination. In this study, the authors sought to identify and understand the discursive effects of discrimination policies within medical education. The authors assembled an archive of 22 texts consisting of publicly available discrimination and harassment policy documents in 13 Canadian medical schools that were active as of November 2019. Each text was analysed to identify themes, rhetorical strategies, problematization, and power relations. Policies described truth statements that appear to idealize equity, yet there were discourses related to professionalism and neutrality that were in tension with these ideals. There was also tension between organizations’ framing of a shared responsibility for addressing discrimination and individual responsibility on complainants. Lastly, there were also competing discourses on promoting freedom from discrimination and the concept of academic freedom. Overall, findings reveal several areas of tension that shape how discrimination is addressed in policy versus practice. Existing discourses regarding self-protection and academic freedom suggest equity cannot be advanced through policy discourse alone and more substantive structural transformation may be necessary. Existing approaches may be inadequate to address discrimination unless academic medical organizations interrogate the source of these discursive tensions and consider asymmetries of power. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123113073"

We require evidence that links critical teaching approaches to future critically reflective practice. We thus asked: does a theory-informed approach to teaching critical reflection influence what learners talk about (i.e. topics of discussion) and how they talk (i.e. whether they talk in critically reflective ways) during subsequent learning experiences? Pre-clinical students (n = 75) were randomized into control and intervention conditions (8 groups each, of up to 5 interprofessional students). Participants completed an online Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) module, followed by either: a SDoH discussion (control) or critically reflective dialogue (intervention). Participants then experienced a common learning session (homecare curriculum and debrief) as outcome assessment, and another similar session one-week later. Blinded coders coded transcripts for what (topics) was said and how (critically reflective or not). We constructed Bayesian regression models for the probability of meaning units (unique utterances) being coded as particular what codes and as critically reflective or not (how). Groups exposed to the intervention were more likely, in a subsequent learning experience, to talk in a critically reflective manner (how) (0.096 [0.04, 0.15]) about similar content (no meaningful differences in what was said). This difference waned at one-week follow up. We showed experimentally that a particular critical pedagogical approach can make learners’ subsequent talk, ways of seeing, more critically reflective even when talking about similar topics. This study offers the field important new options for studying historically challenging-to-evaluate impacts and supports theoretical assertions about the potential of critical pedagogies. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122020860"

This phenomenon impacts curriculum implementation, program evaluation and disrupts dialogue with the education community. The purpose of this study is to explore how Canadian key opinion leaders describe the philosophy and practice of CBME. A purposeful and snowball sample of Canadian key opinion leaders, reflecting diversity of institutions and academic roles, was recruited. A qualitative thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews was conducted using the principles of constructivist grounded theory. A modified integrated knowledge user checking process was accomplished via a national open meeting of educators, researchers, and leaders in postgraduate medical education. Research ethics board approval was received. 17 interviews were completed between September and November 2018. 43 participants attended the open meeting. There was no unified framing or definition of CBME; perspectives were heterogenous. Most participants struggled to identify a philosophy or theory that underpinned CBME. CBME was often defined by key operational practices, including an emphasis on work-based assessments and coaching relationships between learners and supervisors. CBME was articulated as addressing problems with current training models, including failure to fail, rigor in the structure of training and maintaining the social contract with the public. The unintended consequences of CBME included a reductionist framing of competence and concern for resident wellness with changes to the learning environment. This study demonstrates a heterogeneity in defining CMBE among Canadian key opinion leaders. Future work should explore the fidelity of implementation of CBME. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105135436"

At the same time, there is growing recognition that emotion influences learning through numerous cognitive processes including motivation, attention, working memory, and long-term memory. This study explores how emotion influences the cognitive load experienced by trainees performing patient handovers. From January to March 2019, 693 (38.7%) of 1807 residents and fellows from a 24-hospital health system in New York city completed a survey after performing a handover. Participants rated their emotional state and cognitive load. The survey included questions about features of the learner, task, and instructional environment. The authors used factor analysis to identify the core dimensions of emotion. Regression analyses explored the relationship between the emotion factors and cognitive load types. Two emotion dimensions were identified representing invigoration and tranquility. In regression analyses, higher levels of invigoration, tranquility, and their interaction were independently associated with lower intrinsic load and extraneous load. The interaction of invigoration and tranquility predicted lower germane load. The addition of the emotion variables to multivariate models including other predictors of cognitive load types significantly increased the amount of variance explained. The study provides a model for measuring emotions in workplace learning. Because emotion appears to have a significant influence on cognitive load types, instructional designers should consider strategies that help trainees regulate emotion in order to reduce cognitive load and improve learning and performance. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106481735"

University Health Network and University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada","Programmatic assessment is now well entrenched in medical education, allowing us to reflect on when it first emerged and how it evolved into the form we know today. Drawing upon the intellectual tradition of historical epistemology, we provide a philosophically-oriented historiographical study of programmatic assessment. Our goal is to trace its relatively short historical trajectory by describing shifting configurations in its scene of inquiry—focusing on questions, practices, and philosophical presuppositions. We identify three historical phases: emergence, evolution and entrenchment. For each, we describe the configurations of the scene; examine underlying philosophical presuppositions driving changes; and detail upshots in assessment practice. We find that programmatic assessment emerged in response to positivist ‘turmoil’ prior to 2005, driven by utility considerations and implicit pragmatist undertones. Once introduced, it evolved with notions of diversity and learning being underscored, and a constructivist ontology developing at its core. More recently, programmatic assessment has become entrenched as its own sub-discipline. Rich narratives have been emphasised, but philosophical underpinnings have been blurred. We hope to shed new light on current assessment practices in the medical education community by interrogating the history of programmatic assessment from this philosophical vantage point. Making philosophical presuppositions explicit highlights the perspectival nature of aspects of programmatic assessment, and suggest reasons for perceived benefits as well as potential tensions, contradictions and vulnerabilities in the approach today. We conclude by offering some reflections on important points to emerge from our historical study, and suggest ‘what next’ for programmatic assessment in light of this endeavour. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105236652"

Our understanding of how exactly reflection yields its educational promise, however, is limited to broad hints at the relation between reflection and learning. Yet, such understanding is essential to the (re)design of reflection education for learning and development. In this qualitative study, we used participants’ video-stimulated comments on actual practice to identify features that do or do not make collaborative reflection valuable to participants. In doing so, we focus on aspects of the interactional process that constitute the educational activity of reflection. To identify valuable and less valuable features of collaborative reflection, we conducted one-on-one video-stimulated interviews with Dutch general practice residents about collaborative reflection sessions in their training program. Residents were invited to comment on any aspect of the session that they did or did not value. We synthesized all positively and negatively valued features and associated explanations put forward in residents’ narratives into shared normative orientations about collaborative reflection: what are the shared norms that residents display in telling about positive and negative experiences with collaborative reflection? These normative orientations display residents’ views on the aim of collaborative reflection (educational value for all) and the norms that allegedly contribute to realizing this aim (inclusivity and diversity, safety, and efficiency). These norms are also reflected in specific educational activities that ostensibly contribute to educational value. As such, the current synthesis of normative orientations displayed in residents’ narratives about valuable and less valuable elements of collaborative reflection deepen our understanding of reflection and its supposed connection with educational outcomes. Moreover, the current empirical endeavor illustrates the value of video-stimulated interviews as a tool to value features of educational processes for future educational enhancements. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101470413"

We anchor our inquiry within Irby and Hamstra’s (2016) conceptual framework of constructs of professionalism. Data from five graduating cohorts (2014–2018) from McMaster University (Hamilton, Canada) (N = 1,021) were retroactively collected and analyzed using traditional and multinominal logistic regression analyses. The relationship among student characteristics, pre-admissions variables, and referral for potential remediation both by occurrence (yes/no) as well as type (academic/professional/no referral) were examined separately. Findings indicate that gender (OR = 0.519, 95% CI 0.326–0.827, p < 0.01) and undergraduate grade point average (GPA) (OR = 0.245, 95% CI 0.070–0.855, p < 0.05) were significantly associated with instances of referral for potential professionalism and academic remediation, respectively. Women were less likely than men to require remediation for professionalism (OR = 0.332, 95% CI 0.174–0.602, p < 0.001). Undergraduate GPAs (OR = 0.826, 95% CI 0.021–0.539, p < 0.01) were significantly associated with remediation for academic reasons. Lower undergraduate GPAs were associated with a higher likelihood of remediation. These findings point to the admissions variables that are associated with instances that prompt referral for potential remediation. Where associations are not significant, we consider the application of different conceptualizations of professionalism across periods of admissions and training. We encourage those involved in applicant selection and student remediation to emphasize the importance of the interactions that occur between personal and contextual factors to influence learner behaviour and professional identity formation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124848109"

Residents and supervisors report various reasons for not engaging in DO. Some of these relate to their interaction with patients during DO. We do not know the patient perspectives on these interactions, nor, more broadly, what it is like to be a patient in a DO situation. Understanding the patient perspective may lead to a more complete understanding of the dynamics in DO situations, which may benefit patient wellbeing and improve the use of DO as an educational tool. We conducted a phenomenological interview study to investigate the experience of being a patient in a DO situation. Our analysis included multiple rounds of coding and identifying themes, and a final phase of phenomenological reduction to arrive at the essential elements of the experience. Constant reflexivity was at the heart of this process. Our results provide a new perspective on the role of the supervisor in DO situations. Patients were willing to address the resident, but sought moments of contact with, and some participation by, the supervisor. Consequently, conceptions of DO in which the supervisor thinks she is a fly on the wall rather than a part of the interaction, should be critically reviewed. To that end, we propose the concept of participative direct observation in workplace learning, which also acknowledges the observer’s role as participant. Embracing this concept may benefit both patients’ wellbeing and residents’ learning. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103240210"

It has been proposed transition is experienced non-linearly in physical, psychological, cultural and social domains. What is less well known, however, is whether transition within these domains can contribute to the experience of moral injury in new doctors. Further, the lived experience of doctors as they transition to practice is underexplored. Given this, we asked; how do newly qualified doctors experience transition from medical school to practice? One-to-one phenomenological interviews with 7 recently qualified UK doctors were undertaken. Findings were analysed using Ajjawi and Higgs’ framework of hermeneutic analysis. Following identification of secondary concepts, participant-voiced research poems were crafted by the research team, re-displaying participant words chronologically to convey meaning and deepen analysis. 4 themes were identified: (1) The nature of transition to practice; (2) The influence of community; (3) The influence of personal beliefs and values; and (4) The impact of unrealistic undergraduate experience. Transition to practice was viewed mostly negatively, with interpersonal support difficult to access given the 4-month nature of rotations. Participants describe relying on strong personal beliefs and values, often rooted in an ‘ethic of caring’ to cope. Yet, in the fraught landscape of the NHS, an ethic of caring can also prove troublesome and predispose to moral injury as trainees work within a fragmented system misaligned with personal values. The disjointed nature of postgraduate training requires review, with focus on individual resilience redirected to tackle systemic health-service issues. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104522179"

Although students and novice therapists who are transitioning to becoming therapists often experience relational dilemmas as a threat to their professional identity, there is scant literature on strategies to help them develop their professional identity. This inductive study is based on data collected from group supervision courses for undergraduate students in Occupational Therapy in 12 groups over six years. The findings emerged from the analysis of 196 dilemma cases presented by the students in class, combined with the 196 personal reflections that the that students wrote at the end of the course about their personal development as occupational therapists. This study presents the five strategies that appeared most critical for coping with these dilemmas and by extension, for identify formation: (1) looking for the overarching goal, (2) differentiating facts from interpretations, (3) understanding what the 'other' is trying to say, (4) discovering the dialogue between the inner voices, and (5) the notions of Having, Doing, and Being. The strategies are based on cognitive models and behavioral repertoires in the literature, and can provide guidelines for student therapists to use to transition from class to workplace. They can also be implemented by clinical instructors and academic educators. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099552207"

Previous studies have largely focused on medical students’ experiences as ‘receivers’ of the hidden curriculum. This study examined how residents and newly graduated physicians conceived of their roles as active participants in the hidden curriculum. An interpretative phenomenological study was employed using individual, semi-structured interviews with residents and newly graduated physicians (n = 5) to examine their roles in perpetuating the hidden curriculum. A thematic analysis was conducted using a reflexive approach. Findings include insight into how residents and newly graduated physicians: (a) navigate the hidden curriculum for their own professional development; (b) intervene in others’ enactment of the hidden curriculum; and (c) seek to repair the hidden curriculum for the next generation through their teaching. In light of our findings, we argue that: (a) more research is needed to understand how early career physicians navigate their engagement with the hidden curriculum; (b) students and educators be supported to consider how their agency to impact the hidden curriculum is influenced by the sociocultural context; and (c) residents and early career physicians are poised to powerfully impact the hidden curriculum through the learning environments they create. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119841989"

We performed a systematic review and evidence synthesis in order to: determine the nature and definitions of mindful practice and associated terms; evaluate the quality of evidence for the benefits of mindful practice; and conclude whether mindful practice may reduce diagnostic error. We screened 14397 refereed reports from the five common literature databases, to include 33 reports related to the use of mindful practice in clinical diagnosis. Our evidence synthesis contained no randomised controlled trials (level I evidence) of mindful practice, the majority of supporting evidence (26 reports or 79%) comprised conceptual commentary or opinion (level IV evidence). However, 2 supporting reports constituted controlled studies without randomisation (level IIa), 1 report was quasi-experimental (level IIb), and 4 reports were comparative studies (level III). Thus, we may tentatively conclude that mindful practice appears promising as a method of improving diagnostic accuracy, but that further definitive studies of efficacy are required. We identified a taxonomy of 71 terms related to mindful practice, 7 of which were deemed core terms due to being each cited 5 times or more. The 7 core terms appear to be sufficient to describe the findings at higher levels of evidence in our evidence synthesis, suggesting that future definitive studies of mindful practice should focus on these common core terms in order to promote more generalisable findings. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098682615"

Consequently, an urgency for new item development methods arises. Automatic Item Generation (AIG) promises to overcome this burden, generating calibrated items based on the work of computer algorithms. Despite the promising scenario, there is still no evidence to encourage a general application of AIG in medical assessment. It is therefore important to evaluate AIG regarding its feasibility, validity and item quality. Objective: Provide a narrative review regarding the feasibility, validity and item quality of AIG in medical assessment. Methods: Electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed, English language articles published between 2000 and 2021 by means of the terms ‘Automatic Item Generation’, ‘Automated Item Generation’, ‘AIG’, ‘medical assessment’ and ‘medical education’. Reviewers screened 119 records and 13 full texts were checked according to the inclusion criteria. A validity framework was implemented in the included studies to draw conclusions regarding the validity of AIG. Results: A total of 10 articles were included in the review. Synthesized data suggests that AIG is a valid and feasible method capable of generating high-quality items. Conclusions: AIG can solve current problems related to item development. It reveals itself as an auspicious next-generation technique for the future of medical assessment, promising several quality items both quickly and economically. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130488369"

A previous study showed that physicians’ diagnostic calibration for easy cases improved, after they received feedback on their previous diagnoses. We investigated whether diagnostic calibration would also improve from this feedback when cases were more difficult. Sixty-nine general-practice residents were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In the feedback condition, they diagnosed a case, rated their confidence in their diagnosis, their invested mental effort, and case complexity, and then were shown the correct diagnosis (feedback). This was repeated for 12 cases. Participants in the control condition did the same without receiving feedback. We analysed calibration in terms of (1) absolute accuracy (absolute difference between diagnostic accuracy and confidence), and (2) bias (confidence minus diagnostic calibration). There was no difference between the conditions in the measurements of calibration (absolute accuracy, p =.204; bias, p =.176). Post-hoc analyses showed that on correctly diagnosed cases (on which participants are either accurate or underconfident), calibration in the feedback condition was less accurate than in the control condition, p =.013. This study shows that feedback on diagnostic performance did not improve physicians’ calibration for more difficult cases. One explanation could be that participants were confronted with their mistakes and thereafter lowered their confidence ratings even if cases were diagnosed correctly. This shows how difficult it is to improve diagnostic calibration, which is important to prevent diagnostic errors or maltreatment. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118606997"

We investigated how access to open-book resources affected questions testing factual recall, which might be easy to look-up, versus questions testing higher-order cognitive domains. Few studies have investigated OBEs using modern Internet resources or as summative assessments. We compared performance on an examination conducted as a traditional closed-book exam (CBE) in 2019 (N = 320) and a remote OBE with free access to Internet resources in 2020 (N = 337) due to COVID-19. This summative, end-of-year assessment focused on basic science for second-year medical students. We categorized questions by Bloom’s taxonomy (‘Remember’, versus ‘Understand/Apply’). We predicted higher performance on the OBE, driven by higher performance on ‘Remember’ questions. We used an item-centric analysis by using performance per item over all examinees as the outcome variable in logistic regression, with terms ‘Open-Book, ‘Bloom Category’ and their interaction. Performance was higher on OBE questions than CBE questions (OR 2.2, 95% CI: 2.14–2.39), and higher on ‘Remember’ than ‘Understand/Apply’ questions (OR 1.13, 95% CI: 1.09–1.19). The difference in performance between ‘Remember’ and ‘Understand/Apply’ questions was greater in the OBE than the CBE (‘Open-Book’ * ‘Bloom Category’ interaction: OR 1.2, 95% CI: 1.19–1.37). Access to open-book resources had a greater effect on performance on factual recall questions than higher-order questions, though performance was higher in the OBE overall. OBE design must consider how searching for information affects performance, particularly on questions measuring different domains of knowledge. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117715761"

The study used an embodied hermeneutic phenomenological methodology to investigate student peer mentors’ perceptions of teaching during peer mentorship. The data were collected over one calendar year (2019) and involved analysis of 10 participants’ interview data and their ‘body maps,’ produced in response to guided questions. Through the data analysis a core theme of ‘commitment to mentee growth’ was identified, along with seven interrelated themes: sharing responsibility for learning, moderating stress, mediating power relations, navigating unknown processes, valuing creative approaches, offering generous acceptance, and facilitating confidence. Student peer mentorship has the potential to contribute to health professions education in a number of unique ways including through embodied attunement, trusting intersubjective relations, and dialogic education. This study is innovative in its purposeful design and aim to investigate both cognitive and embodied perceptions of student peer mentors. The findings point to the promise of student peer mentorship for advancing health sciences education.

The authors illustrate how the complexity of conducting qualitative research through time drives an understanding and use of theory that differs from other research approaches. Longitudinal qualitative research considers time as fluid, subjective, and unbounded–in contrast to the more common taken-for-granted understanding of time as fixed, objective, and linear. Furthermore, longitudinal qualitative research is predicated on a premise of trust in the context of enduring research relationships. Therefore, while subject-matter theories used to investigate topics of interest to health professions educators may be useful frameworks for other types of research, longitudinal qualitative research needs theories that accommodate the myriad of changes in lived experiences through time.

Construct-irrelevant factors influence ratings, and women teachers often receive lower ratings than men. However, most studies focus only on numeric scores. Therefore, the authors analyzed written comments on 4032 teacher assessments, representing 282 women and 448 men teachers in one Department of Medicine, to explore for gender differences. NVivo was used to search for 61 evidence- and theoretically-based terms purported to reflect teaching excellence, which were analyzed using 2 × 2 chi-squared tests. The Linguistic Index and Word Count (LIWC) was used to categorize comment data, which were analyzed using linear regressions. The only significant difference in NVivo was that men were more likely than women to have the word “available” in a comment (OR 1.4, p <.05). A subset of LIWC variables showed significant gender differences, but all effects were modest. Men teachers had more positive emotion words written about them, while negative emotion words appeared equally. Significant differences occurred more often between the men and women residents who wrote the comments, rather than those attributed to the gender of the teachers. For example, women residents used more social and gender-related words (β 1.87, p < 0.001) and fewer words related to power or achievement (β −3.78, p < 0.001) than men residents. Profound gender differences were not found in teacher assessment comments in this large, diverse academic department of medicine, which differs from other studies. The authors explore possible reasons including differences in departmental culture and issues related to the methods used. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123898062"

One promising but under-theorized strategy is to co-produce education in collaboration with health service users. To this end, we co-produced a longitudinal course in psychiatry that paired people with lived experience of mental health challenges as advisors to fourth-year psychiatry residents at the University of Toronto. The goal of this study was to examine this novel, relationship-based course in order to understand co-produced health professions education more broadly. Using qualitative interviews with residents and advisors after the first iteration of the course, we explored how participants made meaning of the course and of what learning, if any, occurred, for whom and how. We found that the anthropological theory of liminality allowed us to understand participants’ complex experiences and illuminated how this type of pedagogy may work to achieve its effects. Liminality also helped us understand why some participants resisted the course, and how we could more carefully think about co-produced, humanistic education and transformative learning. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090858954"

This study investigates student-faculty interactions within a physiotherapy curriculum from the perspectives of students, faculty and physiotherapy managers at a South African university. The data, produced through multiple methods, derive from students, faculty and physiotherapy managers underpinned by critical-feminist perspectives. Thematic analysis of the data produced four themes. Two dominant threads emerging from the analysis as characterising student-faculty relationships are the deeply hierarchical relations of power characterised by a lack of caring and concern for students, and the exclusion of wider constructs for interaction; deriving from a particular entrenched medical model. Ironically, while caring relationships with patients are overtly advocated and developed, they appear to be largely absent in the same physiotherapy curriculum spaces in the relationships between faculty and students. These findings raise questions about how the most foundational attribute of a health science professional, that of caring, is being produced through the curriculum in the relationship between faculty and students in the health sciences. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115414820"

One such factor is whether prior performance information (PPI) about learners influences subsequent decision making. The information can be acquired directly, when the rater sees the same learner, or different learners over multiple performances, or indirectly, when the rater is provided with external information about the same learner prior to rating a performance (i.e., learner handover). The purpose of this narrative review was to summarize and highlight key concepts from multiple disciplines regarding the influence of PPI on subsequent ratings, discuss implications for assessment and provide a common conceptualization to inform research. Key findings include (a) assimilation (rater judgments are biased towards the PPI) occurs with indirect PPI and contrast (rater judgments are biased away from the PPI) with direct PPI; (b) negative PPI appears to have a greater effect than positive PPI; (c) when viewing multiple performances, context effects of indirect PPI appear to diminish over time; and (d) context effects may occur with any level of target performance. Furthermore, some raters are not susceptible to context effects, but it is unclear what factors are predictive. Rater expertise and training do not consistently reduce effects. Making raters more accountable, providing specific standards and reducing rater cognitive load may reduce context effects. Theoretical explanations for these findings will be discussed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100855416"

During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical schools have been forced to undertake distance learning and assessment. The wider literature suggested that e-learning might pose additional challenges for dyslexic students. Here we explore their overall experiences of learning/studying during this time in a phenomenological study. Five medical students were interviewed in depth and the audio-recordings were transcribed verbatim. Transcripts then underwent an interpretive phenomenological analysis. Our results highlighted a largely positive experience, with an improved culture of togetherness, freedom and sense of control. They also revealed issues with a lack of clinical exposure, potential negative impacts on ranking positions for those with dyslexia, and possible cheating in exams. There are some surprising results—in particular the positive responses to how remote learning was delivered. These seemed to put our participants more on a par with their non-dyslexic colleagues—except in some examinations. It is our hope that medical educators may resist a return to ‘the way things have always been done’ when the pandemic has resolved, and by doing so, continue to foster this new, positive culture and paradigm shift. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115109893"

Engaging a range of stakeholders in research priority setting exercises has been posited as one way to address the issues around reducing researcher bias and increasing social accountability. However, assigning individuals to single a priori stakeholder groups is complex, with previous research overlooking cross-category membership and agreement between individuals across groups. Further, analyses have pitched stakeholder groups against one another in an attempt to understand who prioritises what, and often fails to grasp rationales underlying priorities. A deeper understanding of who prioritises what research areas and why is required to consider applicability of results across contexts and deepen social accountability and transferability. A web-based Q-methodological approach with n=91 participants (who) from ten pre-classified stakeholder groups was employed with post-sort interviews (why). Sixty-seven Q-set items (Chinese/English languages) were developed from previous research (what). Participants were mainly from Taiwan, although international researchers were included. Q-sorting was undertaken in groups or individually, followed by post-sort interviews. Eighty-six participants’ Q-sorts were included in the final analysis. Intercorrelations among Q-sorts were factor-analysed (Centroid method) and rotated analytically (Varimax method). Interviews were thematically analysed. Six Viewpoints with eigenvalues exceeding 1 were identified (range = 3.55–10.34; 42% total variance; 35/67 topics), mapping high/low priorities for research foci: Workplace teaching and learning; Patient dignity and healthcare safety; Professionalism and healthcare professionals’ development; Medical ethics and moral development; Healthcare professionals’ retention and success; Preparing for clinical practice. Eighteen rationales for prioritisation were identified: impact, organisational culture and deficit of educators/practitioners were most highly cited. Each Viewpoint, held by multiple stakeholders, comprised a unique set of topic-groupings, target study participants, beneficiaries and rationales. The two most prolific Viewpoints represent how different stakeholder groups highlight key complementary perspectives of healthcare professions’ education in the workplace (efficacy of teaching/learning practices, application of knowledge/values). By illuminating the detail around each Viewpoint, and presenting an holistic description of the who-what-why in research priority setting, others wishing to undertake such an exercise can more easily identify how stakeholder Viewpoints and their epistemic beliefs can help shape healthcare professions’ research agendas more generally. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100792160"

The current widespread practice of using Likert-scale questionnaire only to measure the quantity of collaboration at course and/or program level appears to be insufficient to provide an evidence-base for what counts desirable collaborative learning experience. Drawing on research into student approaches to learning and social network analysis, this study investigates differences in collaborative learning configurations amongst 217 Australian medical students. Based on students’ learning orientations (i.e., ‘understanding’ and ‘reproducing’) and their choice of collaborations (i.e., whether to collaborate or not, with whom to collaborate, and mode of collaboration), the analyses found five configurations of collaborations differing in a number of features. The most desirable collaborative experience was a configuration of collaborations formed by students with an ‘understanding’ orientation. This configuration revealed a strong tendency towards intensive pair work with measurable differences in how easy and effectively they collaborated. The results of the study not only have practical implications for teaching and curriculum design for collaborative learning, but also have significant implications for assessing students’ collaborative learning experiences. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093967835"

Three successive cohorts of medical students completed both implicit and explicit measures of burnout at several time points during their first two years of medical school. Both assessments were conducted via the internet within a one-week period during the first week of medical school, the end of the first year of medical school, and the end of the second year, though not all cohorts were able to complete the assessments at all time points. Mixed linear models were used to compare the two measures directly, as well as to evaluate changes over time in each measure separately. Minimal correspondence was observed between the implicit and explicit measures of burnout on a within-subject basis. However, when analyzed separately, all subscales of both measures detected significant change over time in the direction of greater levels of burnout, particularly during the first year of medical school. These results provide preliminary evidence the IRAP is able to assess implicit attitudes related to burnout among medical students, though additional research is needed. The IRAP detected consistent improvements in positive implicit attitudes toward medical training during students’ second year of medical school, which was not detected by the MBI. Possible implications of these findings are discussed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123110973"

The problem is that handovers are often inadequate because they are not structured according to theoretically grounded guidelines. Based on the cognitive load theory, we suggest that allowing a clarifying dialogue and thereby optimizing germane cognitive load enhances the information quality and diagnostic accuracy at handover, but may prolong handover duration. We also expect that mentioning key information first and thus decreasing intrinsic cognitive load improves information quality and diagnostic accuracy. We developed two representative paediatric cases for presentation in a factorial 2 × 2 design. Sixth-year medical students (N = 80) were randomly assigned to one of four groups that differed with regard to how the case histories were delivered to them (chronological order versus key information mentioned first) and direction of information exchange (unidirectional versus a clarifying dialogue). The receivers of the handover were asked to write a report of the cases and suggest the best diagnosis. Dependent variables were information quality of the written report (Information score), quality of the diagnosis (Diagnostic accuracy score) and the time it took to deliver the written handover case report (Handover report duration). Seen through the lens of cognitive load theory, allowing a clarifying dialogue at handover, and thus optimizing the germane cognitive load, significantly increased the Information score (p < 0.0005), Diagnostic accuracy score (< 0.05) and Handover report duration (p < 0.001). © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094954019"

Each paradigm involves a particular perspective on the purpose of education, the nature of knowledge, what knowledge is valued and included in the curriculum, what it means to learn and how learning is assessed, and the roles of teachers and learners in the learning process. We aim to foster awareness of how these different paradigms look in practice and to illustrate the importance of alignment between teaching, learning and assessment practices with paradigmatic values and assumptions. Finally, we advocate for a pluralistic approach that purposefully and meaningfully integrates paradigms of education, enhancing our ability to drive quality in HPE. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103199097"

In this article, we attempt to analyze the causes of the frequent confusion and conflation of EPAs with competencies and skills, and argue why the distinction is important for education, qualification and patient safety. ‘Tracheotomy’, ‘lumbar puncture’, ‘interprofessional collaboration’ for example are colloquially called ‘skills’, but its is a person’s ability to perform these activities that is the actual skill; the EPA is simply the activity itself. We identify two possible causes for the confusion. One is a tendency to frame all educational objectives as EPAs. Many objectives of medical training can be conceptualized as EPAs, if ‘the ability to do X’ is the corresponding competency; but that does not work for all. We offer ways to deal with objectives of training that are not usefully conceptualized as EPAs. A more fundamental cause relates to entrustment decisions. The permission to contribute to health care reflects entrustment. Entrustment decisions are the links or pivots between a person’s readiness for the task and the actual task execution. However, if entrustment decisions do not lead to increased autonomy in the practice of health care, but only serve to decide upon the advancement to a next stage of training, EPAs can become the tick boxes learners feel they need to collect to ‘pass’. Gradually, then, EPAs can loose their original meaning of units of practice for which one becomes qualified. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125378930"

However, data showing little improvement in the overall proportion of URMs in many health professions, despite widespread use of holistic review, suggest that relatively few programs using holistic review admit substantial proportions of underrepresented minorities. Therefore, more research is needed to understand factors that facilitate holistic review practices that successfully promote diverse student enrollment. The literature suggests that a supportive organizational culture is necessary for holistic review to be effective; yet, the influence of culture on admissions has not been directly studied. This study employs a qualitative, multiple case study approach to explore the influence of a culture that values diversity and inclusion (‘diversity culture’) on holistic review practices in two physician assistant educational programs that met criteria consistent with a proposed conceptual framework linking diversity culture to holistic admissions associated with high URM student enrollment (relative to other similar programs). Data from multiple sources were collected at each program during the 2018–2019 admissions cycle, and a coding manual derived from the conceptual framework facilitated directed content analysis and comparison of program similarities and differences. Consistent with the conceptual framework, diversity culture appeared to be a strong driver of holistic admissions practices that support enrolling diverse classes of students. Additional insights emerged that may serve as propositions for further testing and include the finding that URM faculty ‘champions for diversity’ appeared to strongly influence the admissions process. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107801541"

When introducing and reporting reforms, tensions in faculty may arise because of differing beliefs about the relationship between assessment and learning and the rules for the validity of assessments. Traditional systems of assessment of learning privilege objective, structured quantification of learners’ performances, and are done to the students. Newer systems of assessment promote assessment for learning, emphasise subjectivity, collate data from multiple sources, emphasise narrative-rich feedback to promote learner agency, and are done with the students. This contrast has implications for implementation and evaluative research. Research of assessment which is done to students typically asks, “what works”, whereas assessment that is done with the students focuses on more complex questions such as “what works, for whom, in which context, and why?” We applied such a critical realist perspective drawing on the interplay between structure and agency, and a systems approach to explore what theory says about introducing programmatic assessment in the context of pre-existing traditional approaches. Using a reflective technique, the internal conversation, we developed four factors that can assist educators considering major change to assessment practice in their own contexts. These include enabling positive learner agency and engagement; establishing argument-based validity frameworks; designing purposeful and eclectic evidence-based assessment tasks; and developing a shared narrative that promotes reflexivity in appreciating the complex relationships between assessment and learning. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113290329"

They also differ in their resource requirements. We explored the relative effects of ‘invent and problem-solve, followed by instruction’ (PS-I) learning compared to mastery learning (i.e., standards-based training) on immediate post-test and Preparation for Future Learning (PFL) assessments. PFL assessments measure learners’ capacity to use their existing knowledge and strategies to learn about and solve novel problems. Methods: In this non-inferiority trial, pre-clerkship medical students were randomized to either PS-I, Mastery Learning (ML), or instruction then practice (CON) during simulation-based training of infant lumbar puncture (LP). After a 2-week delay, participants returned to learn and complete a PFL assessment of simulated Knee Arthrocentesis. Two independent raters assessed performances with a 5-point global rating scale. Results: Based on our non-inferiority margin, analyses showed that for both the immediate post-test and the PFL assessment, the PS-I condition resulted in non-inferior outcomes relative to the ML condition. Results for the CON condition were mixed with respect to non-inferiority compared to either PS-I or ML. Conclusions: We suggest cautiously that the PS-I approach was not inferior to the ML approach, based on skill acquisition and PFL assessment outcomes. With ML anecdotally and empirically requiring more time, greater faculty involvement, and higher costs, our findings question the preference ML has received relative to other instructional designs, especially in the healthcare simulation community. We encourage researchers to study the educational and resource impacts of instructional designs using non-inferiority designs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127169345"

Yet surprisingly little is known about how this diagnostic skill is learned or how it should be taught. Some authors have pointed to a dual-process model, suggesting that assessments of illness severity are driven by two distinct types of processing: an intuitive, fast, pattern recognition-like process (Type 1) that depends on many prior patient encounters and outcomes being stored in memory; and a deliberate, slow, analytic process (Type 2) characterized by additional data gathering, data scrutiny, or recollection of rules. But prior studies have supported a dual-process model for the assessment of illness severity only insofar as experienced clinicians chiefly displayed what was presumed to be Type 1 processing. Here we further explored a dual-process model by examining whether less experienced clinicians displayed both types of processing when assessing illness severity across a series of cases. Consistent with the model, a dissociation between Type 1 and Type 2 processing was observed through resident reports of deliberation, response times, and three eye tracking metrics associated with diagnostic expertise. We conclude by discussing potential implications for the training of this enigmatic diagnostic skill. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099019695"

The faculty development literature has attributed these problems to the marginalisation of the clinical teacher role in host institutions. By focusing on macro-organisational factors, faculty development is ignoring the how clinical teachers are shaped by their everyday participation in micro-organisations such as clinical teams. We set out to explore how the roles of clinical teacher and graduate learner are co-constructed in the context of everyday work in clinical teams. Using an ethnographic study design we carried out marginal participant observation of four different hospital clinical teams. We assembled a dataset comprising field notes, participant interviews, images, and video, which captured day-to-day working and learning encounters between team members. We applied the dramaturgical sensitising concepts of impression management and face work to a thematic analysis of the dataset. We found that learning in clinical teams was largely informal. Clinical teachers modelled, but rarely articulated, an implicit curriculum of norms, standards and expectations. Trainees sought to establish legitimacy and credibility for themselves by creating impressions of being able to recognise and reproduce lead clinicians’ standards. Teachers and trainees colluded in using face work strategies to sustain favourable impressions but, in so doing, diminished learning opportunities and undermined educational dialogue. These finding suggest that there is a complex interrelationship between membership of clinical teams and clinical learning. The implication for faculty development is that it needs to move beyond its current emphasis on the structuring effects of institutional context to a deeper consideration of how teacher and learner roles are co-constructed in clinical teams. © 2020, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091161333"

As various studies have reported the benefits of diversifying HHSEP, the barriers and facilitators of increasing the number of Indigenous Peoples in these professions must be identified. The purpose of this exploratory study is to identify and understand the barriers and facilitators Indigenous Peoples face when entering, learning or working in HHSEP. A narrative approach was used in the facilitation of culturally safe sharing circles with Indigenous students and staff to collect perspectives based on their individual experiences in HHSEP. Inductive thematic analysis was used to identify emerging themes in participant experiences and the impact of those experiences on participation in learning and working at the university in these educational programs. Results from this exploratory study identified current academic structures and ideologies rooted in colonialism, that act as barriers for engagement and inclusion of Indigenous students, staff, and clinical and academic faculty. These findings shaped the main themes of this study including negotiation of identity in different spaces, negotiating colonial structures in HHSEP, and negotiating changes and transitions in HHSEP. We anticipate these preliminary results will act as a catalyst for uncovering further changes to be made regarding attitudes, procedures, and practices present in an academic environment that limit the inclusion of Indigenous Peoples in HHSEP. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127552212"

There is an ongoing push within the literature to better embrace subjective human judgement in assessment not as a ‘problem’ to be corrected psychometrically but as legitimate perceptions of performance. Taking a step back and changing perspectives to focus on the fundamental underlying value of fairness in assessment may help re-set the traditional objective approach and provide a more relevant way to determine the appropriateness of subjective human judgements. Changing focus to look at what is ‘fair’ human judgement in assessment, rather than what is ‘objective’ human judgement in assessment allows for the embracing of many different perspectives, and the legitimising of human judgement in assessment. However, this requires addressing the question: what makes human judgements fair in health professions assessment? This is not a straightforward question with a single unambiguously ‘correct’ answer. In this hermeneutic literature review we aimed to produce a scholarly knowledge synthesis and understanding of the factors, definitions and key questions associated with fairness in human judgement in assessment and a resulting conceptual framework, with a view to informing ongoing further research. The complex construct of fair human judgement could be conceptualised through values (credibility, fitness for purpose, transparency and defensibility) which are upheld at an individual level by characteristics of fair human judgement (narrative, boundaries, expertise, agility and evidence) and at a systems level by procedures (procedural fairness, documentation, multiple opportunities, multiple assessors, validity evidence) which help translate fairness in human judgement from concepts into practical components. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094632510"

One thousand five hundred reflections written by a cohort of 369 dental students over 4 years of academic study were evaluated for an overall measure of reflection depth (No, Shallow, Deep) and the presence of six theoretically-indicated elements of reflection quality (Description, Analysis, Feeling, Perspective, Evaluation, Outcome). Machine learning models were then built to automatically detect these qualities based on linguistic features in the reflections. Results showed a dramatic increase from No to Shallow reflections from the start to end of year one (20% → 66%), but only a limited gradual rise in Deep reflections across all four years (2% → 26%). The presence of all six reflection elements increased over time, but inclusion of Feelings and Analysis remained relatively low even at the end of year four (found in 44% and 60% of reflections respectively). Models were able to reliably detect the presence of Description (κTEST = 0.70) and Evaluation (κTEST = 0.65) in reflections; models to detect the presence of Analysis (κTEST = 0.50), Feelings (κTEST = 0.54), and Perspectives (κTEST = 0.53) showed moderate performance; the model to detect Outcomes suffered from overfitting (κTRAIN = 0.90, κTEST = 0.53). A classifier for overall depth built on the reflection elements showed moderate performance across all time periods (κTEST > 0.60) but relied almost exclusively on the presence of Description.

This study aims to explore teaching-related basic need satisfaction, e.g. teachers’ feelings of autonomy, competence and relatedness in teaching, in different healthcare contexts and to provide insight into its relation to contextual factors. We distributed a digital survey among healthcare professionals in university hospitals (UH), district teaching hospitals (DTH), and primary care (PC). We used the Teaching-related Basic Need Satisfaction scale, based on the Self-Determination theory, to measure teachers’ basic needs satisfaction in teaching. We studied relations between basic need satisfaction and perceived presence of contextual factors associated with teacher motivation drawn from the literature. Input from 1407 healthcare professionals was analyzed. PC healthcare professionals felt most autonomous, UH healthcare professionals felt most competent, and DTH healthcare professionals felt most related. Regardless of work context, teachers involved in educational design and who perceived more appreciation and developmental opportunities for teaching reported higher feelings of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in teaching, as did teachers who indicated that teaching was important at their job application. Perceived facilitators for teaching were associated with feeling more autonomous and related. These results can be utilized in a variety of healthcare contexts for improving teaching-related basic need satisfaction. Recommendations for practice include involving different healthcare professionals in educational development and coordination, forming communities of teachers across healthcare contexts, and addressing healthcare professionals’ intentions to be involved in education during job interviews. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85109267551"

This might be partly due to selection practices. We need to better understand decision-making processes by selection committees in order to improve selection procedures with regard to diversity. This paper reports on a qualitative study with a socio-constructivist perspective conducted in 2015 that explored how residency selection decision-making occurred within four specialties in two regions in the Netherlands. Data included transcripts of the decision-making meetings and of one-on-one interviews with committee members before and after the group decision-making meetings. Candidates struggled to portray themselves favorably as they had to balance playing by the rules and being authentic; between fitting in and standing out. Although admissions committees had a welcoming stance to diversity, their practices were unintentionally preventing them from hiring underrepresented minority (URM) candidates. While negotiating admissions is difficult for all candidates, it is presumably even more complicated for URM candidates. This seems to be having a negative influence on attaining workforce diversity. Current beliefs, which make committees mistakenly feel they are acting fairly, might actually justify biased practices.

Two main questions were asked:A.What medical student characteristics are associated with EI? Are there correlations with demographic or other factors?B.What research studies have been done on EI in UME? For example, is there evidence EI changes over time as a result of personal experiences? Should EI be used as an admission criterion? Can EI improve as a result of experiences or deliberate interventions? Method: The authors searched four databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, Education Resources Information Center, and Web of Science) for all papers published up to and including December 2020. Two reviewers independently screened articles to determine if they met inclusion criteria. All authors extracted and analyzed data. Results: A set of 1520 papers on the topic of emotional intelligence was identified, with 119 papers meeting inclusion criteria. Most studies were done at international locations with only 17 done at US medical schools. Seventy-five were cohort or cross-sectional studies. Study populations were mixed among the studies, with year of medical study, inclusion of other healthcare students, and participation rates among the inter-study differences noted. Conclusions: Numerous gaps in the literature on EI exist with several points being clear: (1) there is disagreement on the definition of EI, (2) it is undetermined whether EI is a trait or an ability, and (3) there is marked variability among the instruments used to measure EI. It is also becoming apparent that using EI determination may be helpful as a component of the admission process, higher EI is likely related to improved clinical reasoning, and higher EI contributes to more effective stress management. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118222449"

They support and inform downstream processes such as curriculum design, assessment, accreditation and professional accountability. However, existing guidelines are limited in accounting for the complexities of professional practice potentially undermining utility of such guidelines and validity of outcomes. This necessitates additional ways of “seeing” situated and context-specific practice. We highlight what a conceptual framework informed by systems thinking can offer when developing competency frameworks. Mirroring shifts towards systems thinking in program evaluation and quality improvement, we suggest that similar approaches that identify and make use of the role and influence of system features and contexts can provide ways of augmenting existing guidelines when developing competency frameworks. We framed a systems thinking approach in two ways. First using an adaptation of Ecological Systems Theory which offers a realist perspective of the person and environment, and the evolving interaction between the two. Second, by employing complexity thinking, which obligates attention to the relationships and influences of features within the system, we can explore the multiple complex, unique, and context-embedded problems that exist within and have stake in real-world practice settings. The ability to represent clinical practice when developing competency frameworks can be improved when features that may be relevant, including their potential interactions, are identified and understood. A conceptual framework informed by systems thinking makes visible features of a practice in context that may otherwise be overlooked when developing competency frameworks using existing guidelines. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106229456"

Knowledge translation and implementation science are two areas of study originally developed in clinical medicine in response to concerns that health care practices were incongruent with the scientific evidence. Two decades of research have led to important advances in our understanding of the nature and magnitude of research-practice gaps, the factors that support or impede adoption of evidence in clinical decision-making, and in the design and evaluation of theory driven interventions to reduce gaps. This paper borrows concepts from knowledge translation and implementation science to further our thinking about how health professions education can ‘truly’ be evidence informed. The article is organised in four sections: a discussion of the impetus for the evidence informed health professions education movement; a description of the origins of knowledge translation and implementation science; a discussion on how knowledge translation and implementation science can be leveraged to advance the evidence informed health professions education agenda; and suggestions for future discussion and research. An example is used to illustrate the application of the underpinning principles of knowledge translation and implementation science. The authors suggest a theory driven, staged and systematic approach that integrates knowledge translation principles and processes and involves key stakeholders interested in promoting the application of educational research of evidence. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102078243"

This scoping review explores how undergraduate health professions' students learn to engage with uncertainty related to their academic practice. To our knowledge, this is the first scoping review which examines teaching and learning related to uncertainty across multiple health professions. The scoping review is underpinned by the five-stage framework of (Arksey and O'Malley in Scoping studies: Towards a methodological framework International Journal of Social Research Methodology 8(1) 19-32, 2005). We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, ISI Web of Science, and CINAHL and hand-searched selected health professions’ education journals. The search strategy yielded a total of 5,017 articles, of which 97 were included in the final review. Four major themes were identified: “Learners’ interactions with uncertainty”; “Factors that influence learner experiences”; “Educational outcomes”; and, “Teaching and learning approaches”. Our findings highlight that uncertainty is a ubiquitous concern in health professions’ education, with students experiencing different forms of uncertainty at many stages of their training. These experiences are influenced by both individual and system-related factors. Formal teaching strategies that directly support learning around uncertainty were infrequent, and included arts-based teaching, and clinical case presentations. Students also met with uncertainty indirectly through problem-based learning, clinical teaching, humanities teaching, simulation, team-based learning, small group learning, tactical games, online discussion of anatomy topics, and virtual patients. Reflection and reflective practice are also mentioned as strategies within the literature. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101824625"

Since the movement’s inception, the assumption has been that decisions based on high quality evidence would translate to better care for patients. Despite EBM’s many attractive features and the substantive attention it has received in the contemporary clinical and medical education literature, how it is defined and operationalized as a component of training is often unclear and problematic. How to practice EBM is not well articulated in the literature; therefore, it becomes difficult to teach and equally challenging to assess. In this paper, we put forward a call for deeper consideration of how EBM is taught, and for clarification on how it is defined and operationalized in medical education. In preparing this paper, we considered questions such as what it means to practice EBM, the role that medical education plays in helping realize EBM, how the teaching of EBM can change to reflect recent developments in clinical practice and education, and whether transformations in the practice of medicine necessitate a change in how we teach EBM. We end with four avenues that may be pursued to advance the teaching of EBM in medical education: (1) consensus on what we mean by EBM; (2) clear articulation of EBM-associated competencies; (3) empirically and theoretically supported means of promoting EBM competencies; (4) ways to assess both skill acquisition and use of EBM. We discuss implications for educators of EBM. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115630706"

The increasing amount of data, market forces, and changing landscape of health care suggest that medical students may be faced with a workplace in which understanding how to safely and effectively interact with health AIs will be essential. Here we argue that there is a need to teach health AI ethics in medical schools. Real events in health AI already pose ethical challenges to the medical community.

To achieve this, assessments must demonstrate predictive and consequential validity, however, to date, research has only focussed on the former. The present study attempts to address this gap by examining the predictive and consequential validity of flagging systems used by Australian General Practice regional training organisations (RTOs) in relation to Fellowship examinations. Informed by unstructured interviews with Senior Medical Educators to understand the flagging system of each RTO, meta-analyses of routinely-collected flagging data were used to examine the predictive validity of flagging at various points in training and exam performance. Additionally, flagging system features identified from the interviews were used to inform exploratory subgroup analyses and meta-regressions to further assess the predictive and consequential validity of these systems. Registrars flagged near the end of their training were two to four times more likely to fail Fellowship exams than their non-flagged counterparts. Regarding flagging system features, having graded (i.e. ordinal) flagging systems was associated with higher accuracy, whilst involving the assigned medical educator in remediation and initiating a formal diagnostic procedure following a flag improved registrars’ chances of passing exams.

We argue that flagging is most effective when initiated early in training in conjunction with mechanisms to maximise diagnostic accuracy and the quality of remediation programs. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101475983"

This exploration of OSCE design is informed by Practice Theory, which suggests assessment design processes are dynamic, social and situated activities. The overall purpose is to provide insights that inform on-the-ground OSCE administration. Fifteen interviews were conducted with OSCE academics and administrators from three medical schools in Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada. Drawing from post-qualitative inquiry, Schatzki’s Practice Theory was used both as a sensibility and as an analytic framework. OSCE design was characterised by planning activities, administration activities, negotiation activities and bureaucratic activities; it involves significant and resource-intensive effort in negotiation and coordination. There was considerable local variation but at the same time activities were remarkably consonant across national boundaries. There was a tension between general understandings such as reliability and validity that underpin the OSCE and the improvisational practices associated with design and administration. Our findings highlighted the role of blueprints as a key coordinating artefact but with too many rules and procedures prompting cycles of bureaucracy and complexity. Emphasising coordination rather than standardisation might ease workloads, support adaptation to local environments and prevent an overly reductive approach to this assessment format. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096064142"

Before implementing this educational best practice in rehabilitation curricula, it is imperative to better understand the current context, barriers and facilitators to teach EBP in rehabilitation from the academic to the clinical setting. The aim of this study was to explore faculty and preceptors’ experiences and perceptions of teaching EBP in rehabilitation professions, namely occupational therapy, physical therapy and speech-language pathology. We gathered data from seven focus groups and an individual interview with a sample of 24 faculty and 15 preceptors, i.e., clinical supervisors. Data collected were subjected to inductive thematic content analysis. We identified three overarching themes and corresponding strategies. First, “Recognizing EBP as a multifaceted concept” denoted participants’ lack of consensus regarding the meaning and scope of EBP, and their awareness of such discrepancies. Second, “Complexity of EBP is at the core of teaching practices and experiences” referred to participants’ perception of EBP as a complex process involving high-level cognitive skills, which influenced their teaching practices and challenged students and themselves. Third, “Connections and divides between research and practice” represented the limited and delicate connection between faculty and preceptors, the factors either bridging or maintaining the gap between them, and the impacts of such connections and divides on teaching. Improving collaboration between faculty and preceptors constitutes an essential first step towards more effective EBP training programs in rehabilitation that could be facilitated through online communities of practice or integrated knowledge translation research projects. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105173351"

However, it is unclear how to design student placements without clinical educator stress. Using complexity theory as a lens, fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) was used to explore factors associated with no increased stress for clinical educators during speech pathology (SP) placements. Factor selection was informed by the Demand- Control- Support model and existing literature. No single factor was necessary for clinical educators to experience no increased stress. Varied combinations of all factors were found in 10 paths to no increased stress. These combinations often had passing student(s); however, multiple paths included other factors that could be adjusted by clinical educators prior to placement. For example, having more than one workday per week without students was a factor in four paths to no increased stress despite other potential challenges such as a higher caseload throughput. More experienced educators, who had other supporting factors (e.g. lower caseload throughput or workplace engagement such as support from colleagues and managers), also perceived no increased stress in four paths. Student placements without increased stress for clinical educators require consideration of multiple interacting factors. Principles of complexity theory provide insight into how clinical educators uniquely respond to their individual circumstances, resulting in different experiences of student placement impact even within similar workplaces. FsQCA has highlighted practical ways clinical educators supervise students without increased stress. However, any changes for an individual clinical educator need to be considered in combination with other factors given the complexity of clinical education and healthcare settings. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116162169"

In particular, the perspectives of supervisors of graduates in the diverse hospital and community settings of healthcare practice are not well represented in research about work-readiness. Interview data from a case study of twenty-nine supervisors of speech-language pathology graduates was thematically analysed, using Boundary Critique Theory to interpret how the supervisors’ understanding of graduate work-readiness was bounded within their understanding of their own system, needs and work environment. The four themes captured the skills that the supervisors perceived as critical for graduate work-readiness: Independence; Attitude; Teamwork; and Learning. A tension was identified within these themes, as supervisors’ understanding of work-readiness was bounded by an expectation that graduates are able to moderate how they transfer and apply their graduate skills in their workplace according to the complexity of client needs and the workplace setting. This study increases the visibility of the supervisors’ boundaries around what are and are not considered to be work-ready skills, attributes and expectations of a work ready speech-language pathology graduate. This knowledge can be used to facilitate speech-language pathology graduates to successfully transfer, apply and expand these skills as they transition to work, and may be useful for other health professions to explore. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115192206"

There are two contrasting approaches in competence assessment: an analytic approach that aims to precisely measure observable constituents and facets of competence and a holistic approach that focuses on a comprehensive assessment of competences in complex real situations reflecting actual performance. We would like to contribute to the existing discourse about medical competence and its assessment by proposing an approach that can provide orientation for the development of competence-based assessment concepts in undergraduate and postgraduate medical education. The approach follows Kane's framework of an “argument-based approach” to validity and is based on insights into task complexity, testing and learning theories as well as the importance of the learning environment. It describes a continuum from analytic to holistic approaches to assess the constituents and facets of competence to performance.

Conscientiousness, the perceived educational environment, and learning approaches were assessed at the beginning of the third year in 268 medical students at the University of Geneva, Switzerland. Performance was examined at the end of the third year via a computer-based assessment (CBA) and the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). Path analysis was used to test the proposed model, whereby conscientiousness and the perceived educational environment predicted performance directly and indirectly via students’ learning approaches. A second model included interaction effects. The proposed model provided the best fit and explained 45% of the variance in CBA performance, and 23% of the variance in OSCE performance. Conscientiousness positively predicted CBA performance directly (β = 0.19, p < 0.001) and indirectly via a deep learning approach (β = 0.05, p = 0.012). The perceived educational environment positively predicted CBA performance indirectly only (β = 0.02, p = 0.011). Neither conscientiousness nor the perceived educational environment predicted OSCE performance. Model 2 had acceptable, but less optimal fit. In this model, there was a significant cross-over interaction effect (β = 0.16, p < 0.01): conscientiousness positively predicted OSCE performance when perceptions of the educational environment were the most positive, but negatively predicted performance when perceptions were the least positive. The findings suggest that both conscientiousness and perceptions of the educational environment predict CBA performance. Research should further examine interactions between personality traits and the medical school environment to inform strategies aimed at improving OSCE performance. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110997991"

Health professions educators increasingly turn to gamification to optimize students’ learning outcomes. However, little is known about the concept of gamification and its possible working mechanisms. This review focused on empirical evidence for the effectiveness of gamification approaches and theoretical rationales for applying the chosen game attributes. We systematically searched multiple databases, and included all empirical studies evaluating the use of game attributes in health professions education. Of 5044 articles initially identified, 44 met the inclusion criteria. Negative outcomes for using gamification were not reported. Almost all studies included assessment attributes (n = 40), mostly in combination with conflict/challenge attributes (n = 27). Eight studies revealed that this specific combination had increased the use of the learning material, sometimes leading to improved learning outcomes. A relatively small number of studies was performed to explain mechanisms underlying the use of game attributes (n = 7). Our findings suggest that it is possible to improve learning outcomes in health professions education by using gamification, especially when employing game attributes that improve learning behaviours and attitudes towards learning. However, most studies lacked well-defined control groups and did not apply and/or report theory to understand underlying processes. Future research should clarify mechanisms underlying gamified educational interventions and explore theories that could explain the effects of these interventions on learning outcomes, using well-defined control groups, in a longitudinal way. In doing so, we can build on existing theories and gain a practical and comprehensive understanding of how to select the right game elements for the right educational context and the right type of student. © 2020, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094841075"

Student exchange is predominantly North to South. Students from the Global South are less likely to visit the North on global medical education visits. Global indigenous and traditional ways of knowing rooted may be suppressed, hidden or misappropriated and repackaged for consumption in the Global South with Global North ways of knowing as a reference point. A global history of colonization has shaped this trend influencing postcolonial theorists and decolonial activists to question the legitimacy and depose the influence of dominant Global North ideas. This is evident in how communication skills, reflective practice and narratives are presented and taught. Global North students must be introduced to Global South ways of knowing before visiting the Global South from a position of critical consciousness. Emancipatory education is best led by transformative Global North–South dialogue. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086039121"

Several teaching and learning strategies support the development of competence among student nurses, but the level of competence at the point of graduation remains below expected standards. Therefore, more research is needed to find strategies that can enhance the development of competence among students. The study explored students’ conceptions of competence and the learning processes that support the development of competence in nursing practice. Gaining an understanding of learning and competence from the student’s perspective can improve our current understanding of the development of competence. Utilising a phenomenographic approach, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions were conducted among purposively sampled groups of nursing students. The analysis of data was managed through ATLAS. ti 8.1 and followed the process of familiarisation, condensation, comparison, grouping, articulating labelling and contrasting of excerpts to generate the students’ conceptions of learning. Five categories of description emerged and showed that the development of competence involves students increasing their understanding of what competence is, hence changing their learning strategies to meet the level of competence, as they understood it. In order of hierarchy from the lowest, the categories of description were: competence is understood as task completion; competence is understood as passing assessments /satisfying facilitators; competence is understood as applying theory to practice; competence is understood as performance of nursing according to clinical standards/guidelines; and competence is understood as performance that yields positive health outcomes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102959546"

Current understandings of work-integrated learning or a ‘work-based placement’, focus on students being consumers of experiences rather than providing a reciprocal benefit to the organisation in which they are placed. More nuanced understanding of the ways that students can offer value to organisations may provide new opportunities and increased capacity for workplace learning. This study drew on Social Exchange Theory to explore the perceived value and benefits of work-integrated learning experiences to the organisations in which students are placed. The focus was on population health placements undertaken by dietetics students at a large Australian university. An interpretive approach was employed with interviews with placement educators and document analysis of student-generated products from their placement. Seventeen of 20 eligible placement educators were interviewed, with interview data coded using thematic framework analysis. These data were supported with document analysis of student scientific posters completed as part of assessment to develop themes which were interpreted with social exchange theory. Three themes were identified: (1) students add to the organisation’s capacity, (2) benefits outweigh time cost of planning and supervising and (3) explicitly valuing students for their contributions may build trust and further potentiate bi-directional benefits. Results suggest that student placements can add value to organisations. This reciprocity of benefits should be communicated to all stakeholders involved in the university-community collaboration, including students. Social exchange theory sensitised researchers to nuanced findings that may support the translation of these study findings to other student work-integrated learning settings. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101833327"

The stated strength of the OSCE is that such error might largely balance out over the exam as a whole. This study uses linear mixed models to estimate the impact of different factors (examiner, station, candidate and exam) on station-level total domain score and, separately, on a single global grade. The exam data is from 442 separate administrations of an 18 station OSCE for international medical graduates who want to work in the National Health Service in the UK. We find that variation due to examiner is approximately twice as large for domain scores as it is for grades (16% vs. 8%), with smaller residual variance in the former (67% vs. 76%). Combined estimates of exam-level (relative) reliability across all data are 0.75 and 0.69 for domains scores and grades respectively. The correlation between two separate estimates of stringency for individual examiners (one for grades and one for domain scores) is relatively high (r=0.76) implying that examiners are generally quite consistent in their stringency between these two assessments of performance. Cluster analysis indicates that examiners fall into two broad groups characterised as hawks or doves on both measures. At the exam level, correcting for examiner stringency produces systematically lower cut-scores under borderline regression standard setting than using the raw marks. In turn, such a correction would produce higher pass rates—although meaningful direct comparisons are challenging to make. As in other studies, this work shows that OSCEs and other standardised performance assessments are subject to substantial variation in examiner stringency, and require sufficient domain sampling to ensure quality of pass/fail decision-making is at least adequate. More, perhaps qualitative, work is needed to understand better how examiners might score similarly (or differently) between the awarding of station-level domain scores and global grades. The issue of the potential systematic bias of borderline regression evidenced for the first time here, with sources of error producing cut-scores higher than they should be, also needs more investigation. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125475262"

Its main difficulties manifest as problems with motor coordination, organisation, academic and social difficulties. There are now more students arriving at university with SpLDs, and, therefore, a similar rise may be expected within medical education. There has been no previous research focusing on dyspraxia in doctors. An interpretive phenomenological approach was used. Six UK foundation schools disseminated the announcements. Three participants took part in loosely structured telephone interviews regarding their experiences of undertaking medical school and foundation school with dyspraxia. These were transcribed verbatim and then thematically analysed. The themes could be split into two main categories: “Weakness and Coping Strategies” and “Perspectives of Dyspraxia”. “Weakness” included: clumsiness, organisation and needing extra time. The participants focused on their “Coping Strategies” that included: Ensuring safety, adapted learning preferences and external support. “Perspectives of Dyspraxia” included: diagnosis, career choice, stigma, “normalisation” and the “difference view” or “medical deficit” view of dyspraxia. Doctors with dyspraxia often mask their difficulties through sophisticated coping strategies. These were determined and hardworking individuals who believe that their dyspraxia was a positive aspect of their identity, adopting a “difference view”. They felt further education is needed about dyspraxia to change the perceived stigma. There is now a need for further research in this area. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100859234"

Studying the individual, patient, clinical, and contextual factors that interfere with compassion—the “barriers”—may clarify our understanding of the origins of compassion and identify potential targets for improving patient-centred care. Studies of the related construct of empathy have suggested that medical students report declines with increasing clinical experience. In contrast, when comparing physicians with medical students, increased clinical experience predicts lower barriers to compassion. Whether—and how—a similar experience-related decline in the factors that interfere with compassion occurs across medical training remains unknown. Aims: To describe how the barriers to compassion vary across clinical training in medical students. Method: New Zealand medical students (N = 351) in their clinical years (Years 4–6) completed measures of the Barriers to Physician Compassion (BPCQ) and potential covariates such as demographics, work burden factors, and dispositional factors. The BPCQ indexes the extent to which barriers in four domains (individual, patient, clinical, and contextual) interfere with a physician/student’s compassion towards patients. Analyses of variance and regression analyses were used to explore the effect of year level on the four types of barriers. Results: Year 4 students reported slightly lower student-related, environmental and patient/family-related (but not clinical) barriers than Year 6 students (effect size: ɷ2 < 0.05); all barriers increased comparably across training. Controlling for relevant confounds, regression analyses confirmed that lower year level predicted lower barriers to compassion. Higher self-compassion, but not gender, predicted lower barriers. Conclusions: In extending studies of empathy decline, this report suggests that students experience higher barriers to compassion as clinical training progresses. This is in contrast to existing studies contrasting physicians with medical students, where greater experience was associated with lower perceived barriers to compassion. Self-compassion may offset increases in barriers to care. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127660140"

Although a plethora of clinical reasoning studies in healthcare professionals exists, the majority appear to originate from Western cultures. A scoping review was undertaken to examine clinical reasoning related research across Asian cultures. PubMed, SciVerse Scopus, Web of Science and Airiti Library databases were searched. Inclusion criteria included full-text articles published in Asian countries (2007 to 2019). Search terms included clinical reasoning, thinking process, differential diagnosis, decision making, problem-based learning, critical thinking, healthcare profession, institution, medical students and nursing students. After applying exclusion criteria, n = 240 were included in the review. The number of publications increased in 2012 (from 5%, n = 13 in 2011 to 9%, n = 22) with a steady increase onwards to 12% (n = 29) in 2016. South Korea published the most articles (19%, n = 46) followed by Iran (17%, n = 41). Nurse Education Today published 11% of the articles (n = 26), followed by BMC Medical Education (5%, n = 13). Nursing and Medical students account for the largest population groups studied. Analysis of the articles resulted in seven themes: Evaluation of existing courses (30%, n = 73) being the most frequently identified theme. Only seven comparative articles showed cultural implications, but none provided direct evidence of the impact of culture on clinical reasoning. We illuminate the potential necessity of further research in clinical reasoning, specifically with a focus on how clinical reasoning is affected by national culture. A better understanding of current clinical reasoning research in Asian cultures may assist curricula developers in establishing a culturally appropriate learning environment. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110625436"

Which cases to supply to which learners in which order is still to be worked out, with there being considerable potential for adapting the learning. Advances in statistical modeling, based on an accumulating learning curve, offer methods for more effectively pairing learners with cases of known calibrations. Using demonstration radiograph and electrocardiogram datasets, the advantages of moving from traditional regression to multilevel methods for modeling growth in ability or performance are demonstrated, with a final step of integrating case-level item-response information based on diagnostic grouping. This produces more precise individual-level estimates that can eventually support learner adaptive case selection. The progressive increase in model sophistication is not simply statistical but rather brings the models into alignment with core learning principles including the importance of taking into account individual differences in baseline skill and learning rate as well as the differential interaction with cases of varying diagnosis and difficulty. The developed approach can thus give researchers and educators a better basis on which to anticipate learners’ pathways and individually adapt their future learning. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101850801"

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive systematic review of evidence examining effects of academic resilience, grit, perceived stress, locus of control, and Big Five Personality Traits on academic performance of health professions students. A literature search of peer-reviewed, English-language articles describing select noncognitive factors was performed using seven databases. Searches were performed from the earliest index date through May 2020. The following data from included studies were extracted and summarized: research design hierarchy, hierarchy of study outcomes (modified from Kirkpatrick), association between noncognitive factors and academic outcomes, and quality assessment criteria. 149 articles met inclusion criteria. Almost 80% of studies were Level III (observational). Medical students were the most frequently studied population (n = 73 articles). The most studied academic outcome was grade point average (n = 61). Perceived stress and Big Five Personality Traits accounted for greater than 50% of studies. Most studies were rated as fair to good quality. Associations between noncognitive factors and academic outcomes were largely inconsistent, although greater perceived stress was generally associated with poorer academic performance outcomes, while higher conscientiousness, academic resilience, and grit were generally associated with better outcomes. This systematic review represents a large body of evidence concerning select noncognitive factors and their association with academic performance of health professions students. Support services addressing noncognitive factors should be deliberated and tailored for specific health professions education programs and student populations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103359324"

While generally beneficial, the addition of options can lead to misalignment in the philosophical assumptions associated with different features of assessment (e.g., the nature of constructs and competence, ways of assessing, validation approaches). Such incompatibility can threaten the quality and defensibility of researchers’ claims, especially when left implicit. We investigated how authors state and use their philosophical positions when designing and reporting on performance-based assessments (PBA) of intrinsic roles, as well as the (in)compatibility of assumptions across assessment features. Using a representative sample of studies examining PBA of intrinsic roles, we used qualitative content analysis to extract data on how authors enacted their philosophical positions across three key assessment features: (1) construct conceptualizations, (2) assessment activities, and (3) validation methods. We also examined patterns in philosophical positioning across features and studies. In reviewing 32 papers from established peer-reviewed journals, we found (a) authors rarely reported their philosophical positions, meaning underlying assumptions could only be inferred; (b) authors approached features of assessment in variable ways that could be informed by or associated with different philosophical assumptions; (c) we experienced uncertainty in determining (in)compatibility of philosophical assumptions across features. Authors’ philosophical positions were often vague or absent in the selected contemporary assessment literature. Leaving such details implicit may lead to misinterpretation by knowledge users wishing to implement, build on, or evaluate the work. As such, assessing claims, quality and defensibility, may increasingly depend more on who is interpreting, rather than what is being interpreted. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112042073"

One AMC specializing in the care of incarcerated patients is the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB), which hosts the only dedicated prison hospital in the U.S. and supplies 80% of the medical care for the entire Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ). Nearly all medical students and residents at UTMB take part in the care of the incarcerated. This research, through qualitative exploration using focus group discussions, sets out to characterize the correctional care learning environment medical trainees enter. Participants outlined an institutional culture of low prioritization and neglect that dominated the learning environment in the prison hospital, resulting in treatment of the incarcerated as second-class patients. Medical learners pointed to delays in care, both within the prison hospital and within the TDCJ system, where diagnostic, laboratory, and medical procedures were delivered to incarcerated patients at a lower priority compared to free-world patients. Medical learners elaborated further on ethical issues that included the moral judgment of those who are incarcerated, bias in clinical decision making, and concerns for patient autonomy. Medical learners were left to grapple with complex challenges like the problem of dual loyalties without opportunities to critically reflect upon what they experienced. This study finds that, without specific vulnerable populations training for both trainees and correctional care faculty to address these institutional dynamics, AMCs risk replicating a system of exploitation and neglect of incarcerated patients and thereby exacerbating health inequities. © 2020, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092700749"

In this article, we report on an experimental study in which we address the question of how much list-type selected response formats and short-essay type constructed response formats are related to differences in how test takers approach clinical reasoning tasks. The design of this study was informed by a framework developed within cognitive psychology which stresses the importance of the interplay between two components of reasoning—self-monitoring and response inhibition—while solving a task or case. The results presented support the argument that different response formats are related to different processing behavior. Importantly, the pattern of how different factors are related to a correct response in both situations seem to be well in line with contemporary accounts of reasoning. Consequently, we argue that when designing assessments of clinical reasoning, it is crucial to tap into the different facets of this complex and important medical process. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105874871"

However, the directions that guide institutions from quality culture theory to educational practice have been missing so far. A prospective qualitative case study of three health professions education programmes was conducted to explore how a quality culture can be enhanced according to the experiences and perspectives of educational leaders. The data collection was structured by an appreciative inquiry approach, supported with vignette-based interviews. A total of 25 participants (a selection of course coordinators, bachelor coordinators and directors of education) reflected on quality culture themes to learn about the best of what is (Discover), envision positive future developments (Dream), identify actions to reach the desired future (Design), and determine how to support and sustain improvement actions (Destiny) within their own educational setting. The results are presented as themes subsumed under these four phases. The experiences and perspectives of educational leaders reveal that peer learning in teams and communities, attention to professional development, and embedding support- and innovation networks, are at the heart of quality culture enhancement. An emphasis on human resources, (inter)relations and contextual awareness of leaders stood out as quality culture catalysts. Educational leaders are therefore encouraged to especially fuel their networking, communication, coalition building, and reflection competencies. © 2020, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092464596"

To date, no robust evidence exists to support the utility of spaced education in the Family Medicine residency. We aimed to test whether alerts to encourage spaced education can improve clinical knowledge as measured by scores on the Canadian Family Medicine certification examination. Method: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial to empirically and pragmatically test spaced education using two versions of the Family Medicine Study Guide mobile app. 12 residency training programs in Canada agreed to participate. At six intervention sites, we consented 335 of the 654 (51%) eligible residents. Residents in the intervention group were sent alerts through the app to encourage the answering of questions linked to clinical cases. At six control sites, 299 of 586 (51%) residents consented. Residents in the control group received the same app but with no alerts. Incidence rates of case completion between trial arms were compared using repeated measures analysis. We linked residents in both trial arms to their knowledge scores on the certification examination of the College of Family Physicians of Canada. Results: Over 67 weeks, there was no statistically significant difference in the completion of clinical cases by participants. The difference in mean exam scores and the associated confidence interval did not exceed the pre-defined limit of 4 percentage points. Conclusion: Further research is recommended before deploying spaced educational interventions in the Family Medicine residency to improve knowledge. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098685731"

However, the effectiveness of this training can only be fully evaluated when considering the extent to which knowledge transfer and long-term retention occur as a result, the former of which is known to be notoriously difficult to achieve. This study aimed to investigate whether knowledge learned during an online training exercise for chest X-ray diagnosis promoted either knowledge transfer or retention, or both. Second year medical students were presented with, and trained to recognise the features of four chest X-ray conditions. Subsequently, they were shown the four trained-for cases again as well as different representations of the same conditions varying in the number of common elements and asked to provide a diagnosis, to test for near-transfer (four cases) and far-transfer (four cases) of knowledge. They were also shown four completely new conditions to diagnose. Two weeks later they were asked to diagnose the 16 aforementioned cases again to assess for knowledge retention. Dependent variables were diagnostic accuracy and time-to-diagnosis. Thirty-six students volunteered. Trained-for cases were diagnosed most accurately and with most speed (mean score = 3.75/4, mean time = 4.95 s). When assessing knowledge transfer, participants were able to diagnose near-transfer cases more accurately (mean score = 2.08/4, mean time = 15.77 s) than far-transfer cases (mean score = 1.31/4, mean time = 18.80 s), which showed similar results to those conditions previously unseen (mean score = 0.72/4, mean time = 19.46 s). Retention tests showed a similar pattern but accuracy scores were lower overall. This study demonstrates that it is possible to successfully promote knowledge transfer and retention in Year 2 medical students, using an online training exercise involving diagnosis of chest X-rays, and is one of the few studies to provide evidence of actual knowledge transfer. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102385539"

Curricula are often not implemented as intended. An under-explored aspect that might play a role is governance. In light of major curriculum changes, we explored educators’ perspectives of the role of governance in the process of translating curriculum goals and concepts into institutionalized curriculum change at micro-level (teacher–student). In three Dutch medical schools, 19 educators with a dual role (teacher and coordinator) were interviewed between March and May 2018, using the rich pictures method. We employed qualitative content analysis with inductive coding. Data collection occurred concurrently with data analysis. Different governance processes were mentioned, each with its own effects on the curriculum and organizational responses. In Institute 1, participants described an unclear governance structure, resulting in implementation chaos in which an abstract educational concept could not be fully realized. In Institute 2, participants described a top–down and strict governance structure contributing to relatively successful implementation of the educational concept. However it also led to demotivation of educators, who started rebelling to recover their perceived loss of freedom. In Institute 3, participants described a relatively fragmentized process granting a lot of freedom, which contributed to contentment and motivation but did not fully produce the intended changes. Our paper empirically illustrates the importance of governance in curriculum change. To advance curriculum change processes and improve their desired outcomes it seems important to define and explicate both hard and soft governance processes. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102003786"

Education science is happening in many medical specialties; however, Family Medicine or General Practice settings have not seen a proportional share of theory-driven education research. The limited nature of education research in Family Medicine is surprising, given that there are several aspects of general practice that make it a particularly unique and interesting context to study issues of general importance to medical education, and there is a particular need for education research to further the discipline of Family Medicine. It is important that the community of medical education researchers in Family Medicine have a strong understanding and perspective on the breadth and potential impact of their work, and what this means for the training that occurs within and for the discipline. This Reflection aims to inform strategic thinking, collaboration, and innovation in medical education research as it pertains to Family Medicine. It does so by discussing four hallmarks of Family Medicine practice and outlining their independent and interactive potential for medical education research. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091727370"

In daily clinical practice, however, it is not only important that doctors receive a tool with which they can correctly judge—the speed of these judgments is also a crucial factor. In this study, we analyzed accuracy and efficiency in medical Bayesian inferences. In an empirical study we varied information format (probabilities vs. natural frequencies) and visualization (text only vs. tree only) for four contexts. 111 medical students participated in this study by working on four Bayesian tasks with common medical problems. The correctness of their answers was coded and the time spent on task was recorded. The median time for a correct Bayesian inference is fastest in the version with a frequency tree (2:55 min) compared to the version with a probability tree (5:47 min) or to the text only versions based on natural frequencies (4:13 min) or probabilities (9:59 min).The score diagnostic efficiency (calculated by: median time divided by percentage of correct inferences) is best in the version with a frequency tree (4:53 min). Frequency trees allow more accurate and faster judgments. Improving correctness and efficiency in Bayesian tasks might help to decrease overdiagnosis in daily clinical practice, which on the one hand cause cost and on the other hand might endanger patients’ safety. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101043824"

As trainees move into working as fully qualified professionals, they can struggle to know how well they are practising in the absence of formal oversight. They therefore need to build their evaluative judgement: their capability to interpret cues and messages from the clinical environment, allowing them to judge quality of practice. This paper explores how Australian general practice (GP) trainees develop their evaluative judgement. We interviewed 16 GPs, who had recently completed certification requirements, asking them how they managed complex learning challenges across their training trajectory. A thematic analysis was sensitised by conceptualisations of evaluative judgement and feedback for future practice. Findings are reported via three themes: sources of performance relevant information; sense-making about progress within complex learning challenges; and changing practice as evaluative judgement develops. Trainees actively sought to understand what quality practice looked like within complex and ambiguous circumstances but often found it difficult to calibrate their performance. While reflective practice was key to developing evaluative judgment, feedback conversations could provide significant opportunities for trainees and supervisors to co-construct meaning. A ‘feedback community’ was available for frequent instances where supervisors were absent or not regarded as entirely credible, although feedback conversations in themselves did not necessarily assist trainees to develop evaluative judgement. There is room for a more active role for supervisors in assisting trainees to consider how to independently make sense of learning cues. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120536916"

Despite the importance of empathy toward patients in medicine, it remains unclear the nature of the changes in empathy among medical students. Thus, we systematically investigated affective and cognitive empathy for patients among medical students using neuroscientific approach. Nineteen medical students who completed their fifth-year medical curriculum and 23 age- and sex-matched nonmedical students participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Inside a brain scanner, all participants read empathy-eliciting scenarios while adopting either the patient or doctor perspective. Brain activation and self-reported ratings during the experience of empathy were obtained. Behavioral results indicated that all participants reported greater emotional negativity and empathic concern in association with the patient perspective condition than with the doctor perspective condition. Functional brain imaging results indicated that neural activity in the posterior superior temporal region implicated in goal-relevant attention reorienting was overall increased under the patient perspective than the doctor perspective condition. Relative to nonmedical students, medical students showed decreased activity in the temporoparietal region implicated in mentalizing under the patient perspective versus doctor perspective condition. Notably, this same region showed increased activity under the doctor versus patient condition in medical students relative to nonmedical students. This study is among the first to investigate the neural mechanisms of empathy among medical students and the current findings point to the cognitive empathy system as the locus of the primary brain differences associated with empathy toward patients. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104968870"

No consensus exists on what reflection exactly entails; thus far, cross-comparing empirical findings has not resulted in definite evidence on how to foster reflection. The concept is as slippery as soap. This leaves the research field with the question, ‘how can research approach the conceptual indeterminacy of reflection to produce knowledge?’. The authors conducted a critical narrative umbrella review of research on reflection in medical education. Forty-seven review studies on reflection research from 2000 onwards were reviewed. The authors used the foundational literature on reflection from Dewey and Schön as an analytical lens to identify and critically juxtapose common approaches in reflection research that tackle the conceptual complexity. Research on reflection must deal with the paradox that every conceptualization of reflection is either too sharp or too broad because it is entrenched in practice. The key to conceptualizing reflection lies in its use and purpose, which can be provided by in situ research of reflective practices. © 2021, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118941718"

The Medical Emotion Scale (MES) was previously developed to assess achievement emotions experienced by North American medical learners during learning activities. The goal of this study was to create and validate a Japanese version of the Medical Emotion Scale (J-MES). We translated the MES into Japanese and conducted two initial validation studies of the J-MES. In the first pilot study, we asked five, native-Japanese, second-year medical students to assess their emotions with the J-MES during a computer-based clinical reasoning activity. Each participant was then interviewed to assess the clarity and suitability of the items. In a second, larger study, 41 Japanese medical students were recruited to assess the psychometric properties of the J-MES. We also conducted individual, semi-structured interviews with ten of these participants to explore potential cultural features in the achievement emotions of Japanese students. The first pilot study demonstrated that the J-MES descriptions were clear, and that the scale captured an appropriate range of emotions. The second study revealed that the J-MES scale’s profiles and internal structure were largely consistent with control-value theory. The achievement emotions of pride, compassion, and surprise in the J-MES were found to be susceptible to cultural differences between North American and Japanese contexts. Our findings clearly demonstrated the scoring capacity, generalizability, and extrapolability of the J-MES. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105866408"

However, even interprofessional teams are susceptible to group pressures which may inhibit speaking up (positive deviance). Obedience is one group pressure that can inhibit positive deviance leading to negative patient outcomes. To examine the influence of obedience to authority in an interprofessional setting, an experimental simulated clinical scenario was conducted with Respiratory Therapy (RT) (n = 40) and Advanced Care Paramedic (ACP) (n = 20) students. In an airway management scenario, it was necessary for students to challenge an authority, a senior anesthesiologist, to prevent patient harm. In a 2 × 2 design cognitive load and an interventional writing task designed to increase positive deviance were tested. The effect of individual characteristics, including Moral Foundations, and displacement of responsibility were also examined. There was a significant effect for profession and cognitive load: RT students demonstrated lower levels of positive deviance in the low cognitive load scenario than students in other conditions. The writing task did not have a significant effect on RT or ACP students’ behaviour. The influence of Moral Foundations differed from expectations, In Group Loyalty was selected as a negative predictor of positive deviance while Respect for Authority was not. Displacement of responsibility was influential for some participants thought not for all. Other individual variables were identified for further investigation. Observational analysis of the simulation videos was conducted to obtain further insight into student behaviour in a compliance scenario. Individual differences, including experience, should be considered when providing education and training for positive deviance.

While trait anxiety may further increase such risk, little is known about the role of trait mindfulness in mitigating these effects. Here we examine the protective role of specific mindfulness facets as mediators in pathways from trait anxiety to perceived stress, psychosomatic burden and sleep-wake quality in medical students, across repeated measurements throughout the first trimester of the school year. Preclinical medical students enrolled in the second year of the Medical School of University of Bologna completed self-report questionnaires examining personality traits as well as physical and psychological wellbeing. Data were collected at the beginning (Time 1: N = 349) and the end of the first trimester (Time 2: N = 305). As students approached the end of the trimester and upcoming exams, reported levels of perceived stress, psychosomatic problems and difficulties in wakefulness increased significantly compared to the beginning of the trimester. Mediation results showed that trait anxiety predicted such outcomes whereas the protective role of mindfulness facets in mitigating these effects was significant only at Time 2. Specific facets of Nonjudging of inner experience and Acting with awareness proved to be the most effective mediators. Findings highlight that the beneficial role of mindfulness facets in mitigating negative consequences of trait anxiety on medical student wellbeing is revealed in high-pressure periods and when self-regulation is needed the most. Cultivating awareness and nonjudgmental acceptance of one’s inner experiences is a crucial self-regulation resource that can help medical students sustain their wellbeing as they learn and throughout their high-pressure education and professional careers. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102244772"

With the goal of optimizing the educational value of assessment in medical education, we mapped the primary literature to identify factors that may affect a learner’s perceptions of the credibility of assessment and assessment-generated feedback (i.e., scores or narrative comments). For this scoping review, search strategies were developed and executed in five databases. Eligible articles were primary research studies with medical learners (i.e., medical students to post-graduate fellows) as the focal population, discussed assessment of individual learners, and reported on perceived credibility in the context of assessment or assessment-generated feedback. We identified 4705 articles published between 2000 and November 16, 2020. Abstracts were screened by two reviewers; disagreements were adjudicated by a third reviewer. Full-text review resulted in 80 articles included in this synthesis. We identified three sets of intertwined factors that affect learners’ perceived credibility of assessment and assessment-generated feedback: (i) elements of an assessment process, (ii) learners’ level of training, and (iii) context of medical education. Medical learners make judgments regarding the credibility of assessments and assessment-generated feedback, which are influenced by a variety of individual, process, and contextual factors. Judgments of credibility appear to influence what information will or will not be used to improve later performance. For assessment to be educationally valuable, design and use of assessment-generated feedback should consider how learners interpret, use, or discount assessment-generated feedback. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115788845"

This study aimed to synthesise educator perspectives on implementing practice-based IPE and develop recommendations to inform sustainable practice-based IPE. An ethnographic case study was carried out at a school of allied health. Data collection involved six observations, 11 interviews and a review of eight documents. Reflexive thematic analysis, informed by Normalisation Process Theory, established two key themes. First, we found that strategic planning is needed, with a coherent implementation agenda and planned reflection on activities. Second, building partnerships with placement partners was identified as essential. This can be achieved by supporting and championing practice-based IPE activities developed by placement sites and establishing how university and clinical educators can work collaboratively to deliver sustainable practice-based IPE. These conditions create a favourable environment for normalising practice-based IPE in healthcare curriculums, benefitting students, patients, and the overall healthcare service. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096635489"

To investigate this issue, we draw specifically on situated learning theory and its cultural concept to examine their professionalism dilemma narratives that were collected through interviews. Of the 79 interviewed students, nearly half of them experienced patient autonomy dilemmas caused by conflicts between school and clinical culture, which have significant negative impacts on their learning and emotional wellbeing. Four major types of patient autonomy-related dilemmas emerge from the data. It was also found that when school culture and clinical culture clash, the latter has a greater influence on students. Thus, the study argues that Taiwanese students’ frequent encounters with patient-autonomy dilemmas highlight the challenges faced by health professions students in transferring knowledge between school and clinical cultures, and clinical culture has a more powerful influence on their behaviour and clinical decision making. This phenomenon should be taken into account when organizing health professions education. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113502309"

Nevertheless, perhaps the most crucial criticism comes from learners' difficulty in interpreting and making meaningful use of summative scores and the potentially detrimental impact these scores have on learners. The term ""post-psychometric era"" has become popular, despite persisting calls for the sensible use of modern psychometrics. In recent years, cognitive diagnostic modelling has emerged as a new psychometric paradigm capable of providing meaningful diagnostic feedback. Cognitive diagnostic modelling allows the classification of examinees in multiple cognitive attributes. This measurement is obtained by modelling these attributes as categorical, discrete latent variables. Furthermore, items can reflect more than one latent variable simultaneously. The interactions between latent variables can be modelled with flexibility, allowing a unique perspective on complex cognitive processes. These characteristic features of cognitive diagnostic modelling enable diagnostic classification over a large number of constructs of interest, preventing the necessity of providing numerical scores as feedback to test takers. This paper provides an overview of cognitive diagnostic modelling, including an introduction to its foundations and illustrating potential applications, to help teachers be involved in developing and evaluating assessment tools used in healthcare professions education. Cognitive diagnosis may represent a revolutionary new psychometric paradigm, overcoming the known limitations found in frequently used psychometric approaches, offering the possibility of robust qualitative feedback and better alignment with competency-based curricula and modern programmatic assessment frameworks. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125133207"

Feedback that coaches using a feedforward approach, is considered to be more personal and emotionally literate Bussey (Bull R Coll Surg Engl 99: 180–182, 2017), Hattie (Rev Educ Res 77: 81–112, 2007). Many modes of feedback are employed in clinical teaching environments, however, written feedback is particularly important, as a component of feedback discourse, as significant time may elapse before a similar clinical situation is encountered. In practice, time constraints often result in brief or descriptive written feedback rather than longer coaching feedback. This study aimed to explore whether a change in ethos and staff development would encourage clinical dental tutors to utilise a coaching approach in their written feedback. Across two time-points, written feedback was categorised into either descriptive, evaluative or coaching approaches. Cross-sections of data from 2017 to 2019 were examined to determine whether changes in practice were noted and whether there were any alterations in the affective nature of the language used. Feedback moved significantly towards coaching and away from a descriptive approach. A shift towards the use of more positive language was seen overall, although this was solely driven by a change in the evaluative feedback category. Descriptive feedback generally used neutral language with coaching feedback using marginally more positive language. Both categories employed significantly lower levels of affective language than evaluative feedback. These data indicate a move towards feedback approaches and language that may support increased uptake and utilisation of feedback. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114764958"

It is the first to examine expertise development in volumetric image interpretation (i.e., CT scans) within radiology residents using scroll data collected longitudinally over five years of residency training. Consistent with the holistic model of image perception, the percentage of time spent on full runs, i.e. scrolling through more than 50% of the CT-scan slices (global search), decreased within residents over residency training years. Furthermore, the percentage of time spent on question-relevant areas in the CT scans increased within residents over residency training years, consistent with the information reduction hypothesis. Second, we examined if scroll patterns can predict diagnostic accuracy. The percentage of time spent on full runs and the percentage of time spent on question-relevant areas did not predict diagnostic accuracy. Thus, although scroll patterns over training years are consistent with visual expertise theories, they could not be used as predictors of diagnostic accuracy in the current study. Therefore, the relation between scroll patterns and performance needs to be further examined, before process measures can be used to monitor and evaluate expertise development in radiology residency training. © 2020, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092356407"

However, there is limited empirical and theoretical examination as to why, when and how interprofessional and multiprofessional education occurs in QI and the outcomes of these approaches. This paper reports on a qualitative collective case study of interprofessional and multiprofessional education in three longitudinal QI education programs. We conducted 58 interviews with learners, QI project coaches, program directors and institutional leads and 135 h of observations of in-class education sessions, and collected relevant documents such as course syllabi and handouts. We used an interpretive thematic analysis using a conventional and directed content analysis approach. In the directed content approach, we used sociology of professions theory with particular attention to professional socialization, hierarchies and boundaries in QI, to understand the ways in which individuals’ professional backgrounds informed the planning and experiences of the QI education programs. Findings demonstrated that both interprofessional and multiprofessional education approaches were being used to achieve different education objectives. While each approach demonstrated positive learning and practice outcomes, tensions related to the different ways in which professional groups are engaging in QI, power dynamics between professional groups, and disconnects between curricula and practice existed. Further conceptual clarity is essential for a more informed discussion about interprofessional and multiprofessional education approaches in QI and explicit attention is needed to professional processes and tensions, to optimize the impact of education on practice. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094207162"

Here we focus on two binary choices for junior doctors: first, whether to apply to GP; second, whether to accept a GP training place if offered. Previous attitudinal studies have indicated factors claimed to affect recruitment. The current study goes further by quantifying the relative impact of different factors on the propensity of candidates to apply to GP and accept a training place. An online questionnaire was sent to candidates applying to United Kingdom (UK) specialty training in 2015. Descriptive statistics and a path analysis evaluated the importance of various factors on GP applications. Our results were synthesised with an analysis of data from the online applications portal. With 3838 candidates responding to the survey, the path analysis showed that personality and previous GP experiences were strongly associated with the decision to apply. There was some evidence that it was easier to enter GP than other specialties; in terms of deciding whether to accept, the evidence suggests GP was a backup plan for around 9% of candidates who accepted a GP post. Our results indicate that recruitment initiatives should focus on candidates who apply to GP but not as first choice or consider GP but do not apply, particularly by providing substantial experience of GP and accentuating the positives of the specialty such as work-life balance and the intellectual challenge of working with patients in primary care. Acceptance of a GP place may also depend on competition for places in other specialties. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074825736"

Therefore, our research focused on those constructs, answering the question: do the internal structures of the tests in an outcome-based selection procedure reflect the content that was intended to be measured? Downing’s validity framework was applied to organize evidence for construct validity, focusing on evidence related to content and internal structure. The applied selection procedure was a multi-tool, CanMEDS-based procedure comprised of a video-based situational judgement test (focused on (inter)personal competencies), and a written aptitude test (reflecting a broader array of CanMEDS competencies). First, we examined content-related evidence pertaining to the creation and application of the competency-based selection blueprint and found that the set-up of the selection procedure was a robust, transparent and replicable process. Second, the internal structure of the selection tests was investigated by connecting applicants’ performance on the selection tests to the predetermined blueprint using cognitive diagnostic modeling. The data indicate 89% overlap between the expected and measured constructs. Our results support the notion that the focus placed on creating the right content and following a competency-blueprint was effective in terms of internal structure: most items measured what they were intended to measure. This way of linking a predetermined blueprint to the applicants’ results sheds light into the ‘black box of selection’ and can be used to support the construct validity of selection procedures. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074516281"

Emerging dietitians can provide important insights on an evolving workforce that is well-placed to advance future global health. This study aimed to explore a national sample of dietetics graduates’ experiences of, and challenges faced in, dietetics workforce preparation and preparedness in Australia. An interpretive description methodology guided this study whereby researchers interpreted the meanings that participants attributed to their experiences. Twenty dietitians (graduated within the last 2 years) were purposively sampled from across Australia and detailed insights were obtained through semi-structured interviews. A multi-analyst approach employing thematic and template analysis, enabled five themes to be identified across the data set. These included: (1) being held back; (2) chasing the prize; (3) valuing real learning; (4) easing the transition; and (5) encountering influencers. While graduates appreciated their preparation, they were not empowered or equipped to embrace opportunities in diverse and emerging areas of dietetics practice. Graduates were challenged by the competitive landscape of securing obvious job opportunities and by a lack of support in transitioning into the workforce. Practice exposures and encounters with influential dietitians were highly valued. Research on role-emerging dietetics placements along with enhanced support mechanisms for novice dietitians is urgently required to ensure appropriate alignment between future dietetics preparation and practice. Obtaining insights into health professional graduates’ experiences of their education can be used to ensure that emerging health workforces are relevant and responsive to future market needs. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070212898"

Evidencing this through empirical research, however, has proven to be a lot more problematic. This paper retraces how the discourse on motivation started from a laymen’s conception in the early days of PBL, and slowly evolved into a field of scientific inquiry in the 1980s and 1990s. However, looking at the evolution of motivation theory over the same period, we show that motivation discourse in the burgeoning literature on motivation and PBL remained largely wedded to the laymen’s approach, and failed to catch up with the new achievement-goal theory and self-determination theory approaches. This paper proceeds to analyse the explosion of studies on PBL and motivation after 2000, acknowledging efforts to move away from anecdotal accounts and provide theoretical grounding to the research. However, once again, we show that the majority of the research employed outdated motivational measures that do not fully grasp the complexity of contemporary motivation theory. The paper concludes on the observation that single-course and curriculum-wide research interventions have yielded no conclusive results on the effect of PBL on intrinsic motivation, and that future research should therefore seek to use up-to-date motivational constructs in more targeted interventions. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076359974"

Such a change could serve as an important source of clinical feedback to the prior physician. However, this feedback may not transpire if the current physician doubts the prior physician’s receptivity to the information. This study explored facilitators of and barriers to feedback communication in the context of patient care transitions using an exploratory sequential, qualitative to quantitative, mixed methods design. Twenty-two internal medicine residents and hospitalist physicians from two teaching hospitals were interviewed and data were analyzed thematically. A prominent theme was participants’ reluctance to communicate diagnostic changes. Participants perceived case complexity and physical proximity to facilitate, and hierarchy, unfamiliarity with the prior physician, and lack of relationship to inhibit communication. In the subsequent quantitative portion of the study, forty-one hospitalists completed surveys resulting in 923 total survey responses. Multivariable analyses and a mixed-effects model were applied to survey data with anticipated receptivity as the outcome variable. In the mixed-effects model, four factors had significant positive associations with receivers’ perceived receptivity: (1) feedback senders’ time spent on teaching services (β = 0.52, p = 0.02), (2) receivers’ trustworthiness and clinical credibility (β = 0.49, p < 0.001), (3) preference of both for shared work rooms (β = 0.15, p = 0.006), and (4) receivers being peers (β = 0.24, p < 0.001) or junior colleagues (β = 0.39, p < 0.001). This study suggests that anticipated receptivity to feedback about changed clinical decisions affects clinical communication loops. Without trusting relationships and opportunities for low risk, casual conversations, hospitalists may avoid such conversations. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073921575"

As the field matures, researchers are increasingly seeking evidence to support various teaching and assessment methods. However, there is a tendency to focus on a limited set of topics, leaving other areas under-examined and limiting our understanding of the field. By explicitly examining areas that are undescribed, i.e. absences in the literature, researchers and scholars have the potential to enrich our practice and our field’s understanding of what counts as legitimate research. Using the theoretical framework of Bourdieu’s concept of field, we conducted an instrumental case study of three published research projects that each had a finding of absence. We examined each case individually, and then analyzed across cases. Our dataset included published papers, peer-review feedback, and reflective notes. Each of the cases interrogated a different form of absence: absence of content, absence of research, and absence of evidence. While the typology suggests that each absence was different, there were similarities across cases in terms of challenges in ‘proving’ the reality of the absence and some disbelief or discomfort with accepting the findings as rigorous and/or legitimate. Absence research has potential to add to our theoretical and methodological approaches to the field.

However, early PIF research may have inadvertently left out experiences from ethnically/racially minoritized physicians. As a result, the PIF literature may have forwarded dominant perspectives and assumptions about PIF that does not reflect those of minoritized physicians. This study used a cross-sectional study design, in which interview data was initially collected using constructivist grounded theory and then analyzed using critical lenses. Participants included 14 Black/African American students, 10 residents, and 17 attending physicians at two Southern medical schools in the U.S. Coding included the both/and conceptual framework developed out of Black feminist scholarship, and further analyzed using medicine’s culture of Whiteness. These lenses identified assumptions made in the dominant PIF literature and how they compared to the experiences described by Black physicians. The results show that medical education’s historical exclusion of minoritized physicians in medical education afforded a culture of Whiteness to proliferate, an influence that continues to frame the PIF research. Black physicians described their professional identity in terms of being in service to their racial/ethnic community, and the interconnectedness between personal/professional identities and context. Their professional identity was used to challenge larger social, historical, and cultural mistreatment of Black Americans, findings not described in the dominant PIF research. Black physicians’ experiences as minoritized individuals within a culture of Whiteness reveals that the PIF literature is limited, and the current framings of PIF may be inadequate to study minoritized physicians. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086790046"

Methods that can assess students’ ability to apply such integrated knowledge are not as developed, however. The purpose of this project was to assess the validity of scores on a focused version of concept maps called mechanistic case diagrams (MCDs), which are hypothesized to enhance existing tools for assessing integrated knowledge that supports clinical reasoning. The data were from the medical school graduating class of 2018 (N = 136 students). In 2014–2015 we implemented a total of 16 case diagrams in case analysis groups within the Mechanisms of Health and Disease (MOHD) strand of the pre-clinical curriculum. These cases were based on topics being taught during the lectures and small group sessions for MOHD. We created an overall score across all 16 cases for each student. We then correlated these scores with performance in the preclinical curriculum [as assessed by overall performance in MOHD integrated foundational basic science courses and overall performance in the Clinical and Professional Skills (CAPS) courses], and standardized licensing exam scores [United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)] Step 1 (following core clerkships) and Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (at the beginning of the fourth year of medical school). MCD scores correlated with students’ overall basic science scores (r =.46, p =.0002) and their overall performance in Clinical and Professional Skills courses (r =.49, p <.0001). In addition, they correlated significantly with standardized exam measures, including USMLE Step 1 (r =.33, p ≤.0001), and USMLE Step 2 CK (r =.39, p <.0001). These results provide preliminary validity evidence that MCDs may be useful in identifying students who have difficulty in integrating foundational and clinical sciences. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075192697"

But in medical practice in particular this networked approach is often compromised by a lingering, historically conditioned pattern of heroic individualism (under the banner ‘self help’). In an era promising patient-centredness and inter-professional practices, we must ask: ‘when will medicine, and its informing agent medical education, embrace democratic habits and collectivism?’ The symptom of lingering heroic individualism is particularly prominent in North American medical education. This is echoed in widespread resistance to a government-controlled public health, where the USA remains the only advanced economy that fails to provide universal health care. I track a resistance to collectivist medical-educational reform historically from a mid-nineteenth century nexus of influential thinkers who came, some unwittingly, to shape North American medical education within a Protestant-Capitalist individualist tradition. This tradition still lingers, where some doctors recall a fictional ‘golden age’ of medical practice and education, actually long since eclipsed by fluid inter-professional health care team practices. I cast this tension between conservative traditions of individualism and progressive collectivism as a political issue. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094650872"

This is unlikely to change with newly graduating students, as 2.6% of 2017 graduates were African American and 5.7% were Hispanic or Latino. Faculty mentorship has a more profound influence on the retention of underrepresented minority students as compared with students from privileged backgrounds, according to undergraduate literature. The influences of faculty characteristics on physical therapy graduates of color are unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine faculty and programmatic characteristics that could influence the percentage of physical therapy graduates of color. This study implemented the theory of academic capitalism to inform the results of a retrospective panel analysis, which used accreditation data from 2008 to 2017. Data from 231 programs was used to create fixed effects and random effects models to estimate the effects that faculty and program characteristics had on the percentage of graduates of color that a program produced. There was a statistically significant positive relationship between faculty of color and graduates of color (p < 0.001), but faculty must be sufficiently diverse before a program can expect a meaningful change in their percentage of graduates of color. Academic capitalist principles suggest that competition between programs for resources could negatively influence the proportion of graduates of color. Cause and effect associations between variables cannot be established. The authors concluded that professional physical therapy programs appeared to have increases in the percentages of graduates of color when they had more core faculty members of color. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85087066334"

UK literature indicates that pupils in these schools feel that their teachers are ill-equipped, cautious or even discouraging towards their aspiration and/or application to medicine. This study aimed to explore teachers’ perspectives and practices to include their voice in discussions and consider how medical schools might best engage with them to facilitate WA. Interviews were conducted with high school teachers in three UK regions, working in schools targeted by WA initiatives. Data were analysed thematically using template analysis, using a largely data-driven approach. Findings showed that although medicine was largely seen as a prestigious and worthwhile career, teachers held reservations about advocating this above other choices. Teachers saw it as their role to encourage pupils to educate themselves about medicine, but to ultimately allow pupils to make their own decisions. Their attitudes were influenced by material constraints in their schools, and the perception of daunting, long and emotionally difficult admissions requirements, with low chances of success. Medical schools may wish to work with teachers to understand their hesitations and help them develop the mindset required to advocate a challenging and unfamiliar career, emphasising that this encouragement can further the shared goal of empowering and preparing pupils to feel capable of choosing medicine. Reciprocally, medical schools should ensure pupils have fair opportunities for access, should they choose to apply. © 2020, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088598050"

It is used in formative assessments to guide the learning process as well as in large-scales assessments to monitor educational programs. Yet, such assessments suffer from high variation in students’ test-taking effort. We aimed to identify institutional strategies related to serious test-taking behavior in low stakes assessment to provide medical schools with practical recommendations on how test-taking effort might be increased. First, we identified strategies that were already used by medical schools to increase the serious test-taking behavior on the low stakes Berlin Progress Test (BPT). Strategies which could be assigned to self-determination theory of Ryan and Deci were chosen for analysis. We conducted the study at nine medical schools in Germany and Austria with a total of 108,140 observations in an established low stakes assessment. A generalized linear-mixed effects model was used to assess the association between institutional strategies and the odds that students will take the BPT seriously. Overall, two institutional strategies were found to be positively related to more serious test-taking behavior: discussing low test performance with the mentor and consequences for not participating. Giving choice was negatively related to more serious test-taking behavior. At medical schools that presented the BPT as evaluation, this effect was larger in comparison to medical schools that presented the BPT as assessment. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074597579"

Studies on empathy changes among medical students are not univocal: empathy may decline, remain stable or increase. A largely unexplored research question regards inter-individual variability in empathy change, namely if different longitudinal trajectories of empathy exist. Evidence on the association of empathy trajectories with personality and motives for studying medicine is also scarce. Here, latent growth modeling examined empathy (measured with the Jefferson Scale of Empathy) among 201 medical students (Mage = 20.74, 57% females) across three assessments: at entry year (Year 1) and during the first two clinical years (Years 4 and 5). Associations between empathy trajectories, personality in Year 1 and motives for studying medicine in Years 4 and 5 were tested. We identified two empathy trajectory groups: lower and decreasing (n = 59; 29%) and higher and stable (n = 142; 71%). Regression analyses indicated that higher openness in Year 1 was associated with an increased probability of higher and stable group membership (controlling for motives in Year 1). The effect of openness disappeared controlling for motives in Years 4 and 5 while caring for patients (in Years 4 and 5) and altruism (in Year 4) were positively associated with an increased probability of higher and stable group membership. In sum, we observed that empathy remains stable in most medical students and declines in fewer; openness and patients-oriented motives for studying medicine are associated with higher and stable empathy. Encouraging medical students’ patients-oriented motives from preclinical throughout clinical years may prevent empathy decline. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092189184"

Attempts to improve feedback frequently focus on faculty development programs without addressing learners’ capabilities to engage with feedback. For feedback to be effective, students need to understand its processes and to translate this into practice. Developing student feedback literacy may enhance feedback engagement and, therefore, learning outcomes. This qualitative interview study aimed to problematise student feedback literacy in the healthcare setting, from the learner’s perspective. Before commencing placements, 105 healthcare students at an Australian teaching hospital participated in a feedback literacy program. After their placements, 27 students engaged in semi-structured interviews to explore their feedback experiences. Informed by workplace learning theory, interview transcripts were analysed using the framework method of qualitative analysis. Students reported reframing feedback as a process they could initiate and engage in, rather one they were subjected to. When they took an intentional stance, students noted that feedback conversations generated plans for improvement which they were enacting. However, students had to work hard against orthodox feedback expectations and habits in healthcare. They privileged intraprofessional supervisor feedback over interprofessional practitioners, patients, or peers. Findings suggest that student engagement with feedback can be augmented with focussed retraining. However, further research examining the structural and cultural influences on students’ capacity to be active in workplace feedback is warranted. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073934806"

These assumptions are: (1) disciplines are silos that inhibit the free flowing of knowledge across fields and stifle innovative thinking; (2) interdisciplinary research generates a better understanding of the world as it brings together researchers from various fields of expertise capable of tackling complex problems; and (3) interdisciplinary research reduces fragmentation across groups of researchers by eliminating boundaries. These assumptions are among the new beliefs shaping the contemporary academic arena; they orient academics’ and university administrators’ decisions toward expanding interdisciplinary research and training, but without solid empirical evidence. This article argues that the field of HPER has largely adopted the premises of interdisciplinary research but has not yet debated the potential effects of organizing around these premises. The authors hope to inspire members of the HPER community to critically examine the ubiquitous discourse promoting interdisciplinarity, and engage in reflection about the future of the field informed by evidence rather than by unsubstantiated assumptions. For example: Should research centres and graduate programs in HPER encourage the development of interdisciplinary or disciplinary-trained researchers? Should training predominantly focus on methods and methodologies or draw more on disciplinary-based knowledge? What is the best route toward increasing the field’s profile within academia and attracting the best students and researchers to engage in HPER? These are questions that merit attention at the current juncture as the future of the HPER field relies on decisions made in the present time. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071171796"

Box # 85500, Utrecht, 3508 GA, Netherlands","Interprofessional education (IPE) and entrustable professional activities (EPAs) represent two topics in health professions education that have attracted significant attention in recent years. IPE (when different health professionals learn with, from and about each other with the aim of optimal care) has an inherent focus on the collective. EPAs (units of professional practice that can be fully entrusted to a trainee, once he or she has demonstrated the necessary competence to execute this activity unsupervised) have a focus on the individual. Attempts to relate the two may cause friction and the question is: can they be reconciled? Are interprofessional EPAs or team-EPAs useful concepts and if so what should they look like? The authors argue that most work in modern healthcare involves interprofessional collaboration. Some EPAs have an inherent strong interprofessional nature, such as emergency teamwork, running multidisciplinary team meetings, and surgery. Other EPAs are less inherently dependent on interprofessional collaboration. The authors conclude that neither interprofessional team-EPAs (for which a team can or should be certified), nor IP-EPAs for individuals, as opposed to other EPAs, are viable concepts. However, the authors do not question that certifying health care professionals and entrusting trainees with most clinical tasks will require to ascertain their competence in interprofessional collaboration. This must be included when assessing learners for most EPAs and making entrustment decisions. This can help to strengthen interprofessional competence in the clinical workplace. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076926117"

Recent reforms of medical education curricula incorporate specific educational opportunities that aim to foster successful interprofessional collaboration and teamwork. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of curriculum reform on medical students’ perceptions of their interactions and team-working with nurses. We gathered data from 12 semi-structured individual narrative interviews with a purposive sample of male (n = 6) and female (n = 6) medical students from fourth year (n = 6 following an integrated curriculum) and fifth year (n = 6 following a traditional curriculum). Data were subject to narrative analysis which was undertaken using NVivo software. Overall, there was no notable difference in the responses of the participants on the traditional and integrated curricula about their interactions and team work with nurses. However, the introduction of an integrated medical curriculum was viewed positively but a lack of interprofessional education with nursing students, removal of a nursing placement and shorter clinical placements were perceived as lost opportunities for the development of educationally beneficial relationships. The participants reported that nurses play a number of roles in clinical practice which underpin patient safety including being medical educators who provide a valuable source of support for medical students. The participants highlighted different factors that could hinder or foster effective working relationships such as a lack of understanding of nurses’ different professional roles and mutual respect. Medical education needs to provide students with more structured opportunities to work with and learn from nurses in clinical practice. Further research could explore how to foster positive relationships between medical students and nurses. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070283955"

Clinical vignettes demonstrating empathy tasks were presented to participants undergoing fMRI, to assess regional changes in the brain. Self-reported empathy scores and brain activity signals using fMRI from before and after the program were compared. The JSE-S total and perspective taking scores significantly increased after the program.

Using a critical narrative review approach, underpinned by our archive of global PBL literature and a targeted literature search, we analyze these dominant global discourses of PBL in health professions education. More precisely, we explore what is missed when the globalization of PBL is theorized either as a positive consequence of standardization, or a problematic spread of Western educational ideals and values around the world. We make visible how two dominant global discourses, a universalist and culturalist discourse, have emerged in the global proliferation of PBL. We also discuss the limitations of the two discourses by demonstrating how they either ignore contextual and cultural diversity or see it as problematic. We then turn to a perspective that has been marginalized in the PBL literature that emphasizes the global origins of PBL, transcending the dichotomy between West and non-West. We make a case for relating to PBL as a plural construct in order to learn from the cultural and situational nuances of educational activities labeled PBL around the world. We argue that PBL as a singular and universal concept has no global future, yet versions of PBL may continue to thrive locally. Finally, we propose avenues for future research that may help elucidate the global and local values that underpin our curricula, as well as the socio-political factors that perpetuate neo-colonialist views and practices in the uptake and implementation of PBL approaches across the globe. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076361366"

E-mentoring is proposed as a means of supplementing this dominant form of mentoring in medicine by providing accessible, timely and longitudinal support for mentees. However, with little is known about e-mentoring nor its role in a blended mentoring approach, a systematic scoping review is proposed to evaluate these gaps in understanding in order to better understand e-mentoring and assess the viability of employing e-mentoring practice to support novice mentoring. Using Arksey and O’Malley’s (Int J Soc Res Methodol 8(1):19–32, 2005) approach, 5 reviewers carried out independent literature reviews of e-mentoring as an adjuvant to novice mentoring in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Google Scholar, Scopus, GreyLit, OpenGrey, and Web of Science databases. Braun and Clarke’s (Qual Res Psychol 3(2):77–101, 2006) thematic analysis approach was used to thematically analyse accounts of e-mentoring across different settings. 6557 abstracts were identified, 109 full text articles were reviewed, and 18 articles were included and thematically analysed. The themes identified include definitions, role, stages, processes, platforms, evaluation, and relationships in e-mentoring. The themes identified provide a clinically relevant definition of e-mentoring, and in highlighting the similarities in the phases of novice and e-mentoring reaffirms the validity of a blended approach as a means of addressing shortfalls in mentoring in medicine. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079334695"

One thousand and forty-eight medical students (Mage = 22.90; 67.1% women) filled out the Portuguese version of the N-GAMS (N-GAMS.pt) along with measures of Physician Empathy and Sexism. A Parallel Analysis and an Exploratory Factor Analysis suggested the presence of three factors. A Confirmatory Factor Analysis showed a good fit of the hypothesized three-factor structure: (1) gender sensitivity (n = 6 items; α =.713), (2) gender-role ideologies towards patients (n = 7 items; α =.858) and (3) gender-role ideologies towards doctors (n = 5 items; α =.837), with a positive association between the latter two (r =.570; p <.001). The N-GAMS.pt also showed good criteria-related validity. Namely, as hypothesized: (1) more empathic students reported more gender sensitivity and lower endorsement of gender-role ideologies; (2) higher hostile and benevolent sexism were associated to higher endorsement of gender-role ideologies; and (3) higher hostile sexism was associated to lower gender sensitivity.

Data science, which includes Artificial Intelligence techniques such as Machine Learning (ML), has been credited with the promise to transform Health Professions Education (HPE) by offering approaches to handle big (and often messy) data.To examine this promise, we conducted a critical review to explore: (1) published applications of data science and ML in HPE literature and (2) the potential role of data science and ML in shifting theoretical and epistemological perspectives in HPE research and practice. Existing data science studies in HPE are often not informed by theory, but rather oriented towards developing applications for specific problems, uses, and contexts.The most common areas currently being studied are procedural (e.g., computer-based tutoring or adaptive systems and assessment of technical skills). We found that epistemic beliefs informing the use of data science and ML in HPE poses a challenge for existing views on what constitutes objective knowledge and the role of human subjectivity for instruction and assessment.As a result, criticisms have emerged that the integration of data science in the field of HPE is in danger of becoming technically driven and narrowly focused in its approach to teaching, learning and assessment. Our findings suggest that researchers tend to formalize around the epistemological stance driven largely by traditions of a research paradigm. Future data science studies in HPE need to involve both education scientists and data scientists to ensure mutual advancements in the development of educational theory and practical applications. This may be one of the most important tasks in the integration of data science and ML in HPE research in the years to come. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094952740"

Historically, research on health professional’s work preparedness has focused on the quality of graduates’ clinical knowledge, skills and problem-solving. This ignores the role of professional identity formation in determining readiness for clinical practice. Yet, professional identity defines graduate self-perception, how others perceive them and informs clinical behaviour. The scholarship of identity formation at the transition from undergraduate to graduate is characterised by individual (cognitive) rather than relational (sociocultural) perspectives. Yet there is growing recognition that identity formation is not just individually mediated, but is also constructed between individuals and social context. The aim of this study was to explore professional identity formation among undergraduates and graduates from one healthcare profession (speech and language therapy-SLT) using a sociocultural theoretical standpoint. A qualitative descriptive methodology was used. Final (4th) year SLT undergraduate students and graduate SLTs with less than 2 years’ clinical experience participated in individual semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis was used to describe patterns in the data, which were subsequently subjected to interpretation informed by the constructs of Figured Worlds. Data analysis revealed that undergraduate professional identity was characterised by dependency, self-centredness (as opposed to patient-centredness), and a naïve role concept. Graduate identity on the other hand included expectations of self-sufficiency, patient-centredness and a more nuanced perception of the professional role. Undergraduates have naïve, prototypical understandings of what it is to be a graduate practitioner. The nature of undergraduate clinical placement hinders meaningful identity development. This suggests that curriculums should facilitate undergraduates to act with meaningful autonomy and to be positioned in more patient-centred roles, e.g. involvement in the decision-making process for patients. Graduates may then feel more authentic as autonomous professionals in their early graduate posts. This leads to better graduate, patient and service outcomes. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078227463"

The sample consisted of four graduating classes, 1996–1999, of Harvard Medical School, 20% of whom were URiM. URiM respondents came from families of lower educational attainment and graduated with more debt. As students, they reported a greater experience of stereotype threat and, and at graduation they showed a tendency to place a higher value on avoiding a career that places them under constant pressure. Concerning their current status, URiM respondents expressed a lower level of satisfaction with their career progress. Multivariable analyses indicated that across the entire sample, URiM status was not a significant predictor of employment in academic medicine, but that being in academic medicine was predicted by mentors’ encouragement for a research career, greater intention to pursue research, and a lower value on having a financially rewarding career. Lower career satisfaction was predicted by one’s status as URiM, employment in academic medicine, greater involvement in research, and a greater value on avoiding constant pressure. The data suggest that negative student experiences in medical school, combined with the lack of mentor encouragement and financial pressures may discourage URiM medical students from pursuing academic careers, and that pressures for productivity and working in academic medicine may degrade the satisfaction derived by physicians in general. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078455547"

Given these roles and their relevance in the health professions, we sought to understand the methods and strategies used in the development of existing competency frameworks. We applied the Arksey and O’Malley framework to undertake this scoping review. We searched six electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Scopus, and ERIC) and three grey literature sources (greylit.org, Trove and Google Scholar) using keywords related to competency frameworks. We screened studies for inclusion by title and abstract, and we included studies of any type that described the development of a competency framework in a healthcare profession. Two reviewers independently extracted data including study characteristics. Data synthesis was both quantitative and qualitative. Among 5710 citations, we selected 190 for analysis. The majority of studies were conducted in medicine and nursing professions. Literature reviews and group techniques were conducted in 116 studies each (61%), and 85 (45%) outlined some form of stakeholder deliberation. We observed a significant degree of diversity in methodological strategies, inconsistent adherence to existing guidance on the selection of methods, who was involved, and based on the variation we observed in timeframes, combination, function, application and reporting of methods and strategies, there is no apparent gold standard or standardised approach to competency framework development. We observed significant variation within the conduct and reporting of the competency framework development process. While some variation can be expected given the differences across and within professions, our results suggest there is some difficulty in determining whether methods were fit-for-purpose, and therefore in making determinations regarding the appropriateness of the development process. This uncertainty may unwillingly create and legitimise uncertain or artificial outcomes. There is a need for improved guidance in the process for developing and reporting competency frameworks. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076058451"

Challenges may arise when these philosophical positions are not considered in assessment design. These can include (a) a logical incompatibility leading to varied or difficult interpretations of assessment results, (b) an “anything goes” approach, and (c) uncertainty regarding when and in what context various philosophical positions are appropriate. We propose a compatibility principle that recognizes that different philosophical positions commit assessors/assessment researchers to particular ideas, assumptions and commitments, and applies ta logic of philosophically-informed, assessment-based inquiry. Assessment is optimized when its underlying philosophical position produces congruent, aligned and coherent views on constructs, assessment strategies, justification and their interpretations. As a way forward we argue that (a) there can and should be variability in the philosophical positions used in assessment, and these should be clearly articulated to promote understanding of assumptions and make sense of justifications; (b) we focus on developing the merits, boundaries and relationships within and/or between philosophical positions in assessment; (c) we examine a core set of principles related to the role and relevance of philosophical positions; (d) we elaborate strategies and criteria to delineate compatible from incompatible; and (f) we articulate a need to broaden knowledge/competencies related to these issues. The broadened use of philosophical positions in assessment in the health professions affect the “state of play” and can undermine assessment programs. This may be overcome with attention to the alignment between underlying assumptions/commitments. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074710096"

Many researchers and educators in the health professions embraced this theory, but few have considered how SLT has been used and what has been learned or improved through its use in health professions education (HPE). In this scoping review, the authors examine these questions and consider opportunities for future work with SLT in HPE. The authors followed Levac’s modified scoping review framework. They conducted a search of CINAHL, ERIC, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for articles referencing SLT or related concepts in HPE between 2006 and 2016. Two reviewers screened all titles and abstracts, then screened full text for inclusion based on substantive treatment of SLT. Two authors extracted, analyzed and synthesized data from the final set of 193 articles. The authors identified two patterns of theory use. One sought an understanding of social learning processes in a specific context. The other aimed to design and/or evaluate interventions associated with communities of practice. These patterns are similar to other literatures (e.g., general education, healthcare, and organizational development) and, according to Lave and Wenger, may reflect confusion about the purpose, stance, and terminology of SLT. The authors discuss their findings in relation to primary source literature and consider opportunities for HPE researchers to employ and contribute to SLT going forward. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068157790"

They offer a unique relationship that is rich and powerful. Researchers have tried to better understand this relationship and the other varieties of mentoring relationships. But there is a significant gap in that research: we don’t talk about the experience of the sudden loss of a mentor. Sometimes mentoring relationships end—especially if the mentoring was in support of specific goals, learning objectives, or when the relationship simply no longer fits the needs of the mentor or the mentee. But sometimes disease, tragic accidents, or other powers beyond our control intervene; suddenly, relationships with important mentors are simply gone. How do we navigate these losses?

The reproduction of dominant gender biases in the medical setting can negatively impact the professional development of medical students and the wellbeing of patients. In this analysis of medical students’ narratives of professionalism dilemmas, we explore students’ experiences of gender bias in hospital settings. Seventy-one students participated in 12 group interviews, where they discussed witnessing or participating in various activities that they thought were professionalism lapses. Within the dataset, 21 narratives had a distinctly gendered component broadly pertaining to patient dignity and safety dilemmas, informed consent issues, and female student abuse. Interestingly, perpetrators of such acts were commonly female healthcare professionals and educators. Although students recognized such acts as professionalism lapses and often expressed concern for patient wellbeing, students did not intervene or report such acts due to hierarchical cultural contexts, and at times even reproduced the discriminatory behavior they were criticizing. This raises concerns about medical students’ professionalism development and the extent to which gender bias is ingrained within particular medical systems. The normalization of disrespectful and abusive treatment of female patients poses immediate and future consequences to the wellbeing and safety of women. Furthermore, the same socio-cultural values that sustain these acts may account for perpetrators often being women themselves as they strive to overcome their subordinate position within medicine. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074020443"

Particularly affected are mentoring relationships between senior clinicians and junior doctors which lie at the heart of mentoring. To better understand and address these concerns, a systematic scoping review into prevailing accounts of ethical issues and professional lapses in mentoring is undertaken. Arksey and O’Malley’s (Int J Soc Res Methodol 8(1):19–32, 2005. https://doi.org/10.1080/1364557032000119616) methodological framework for conducting scoping reviews was employed to explore the scope of ethical concerns in mentoring in general medicine. Databases searcheed included PubMed, ScienceDirect, ERIC, Embase, Scopus, Mednar and OpenGrey. 3391 abstracts were identified from the initialy search after removal of duplicates, 412 full-text articles were reviewed, 98 articles were included and thematically analysed. Unsatisfactory matching, misaligned expectations, inadequate mentor training, cursory codes of conduct, sketchy standards of practice, meagre oversight and unstructured processes have been identified as potential causes for ethical and professional breaches in mentoring practice. Changes in how professionalism is viewed suggest further studies of educational culture should also be carried out. The host organization plays a major role in establishing codes of conduct, expectations, and holistically, longitudinally oversight of the mentoring process and mentoring relationships. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074814817"

This study proposes an alternative strategy for competency-based medical education design, which is supported by change management theories. We demonstrate the value of allowing room for re-invention and creative adaptation of innovations. This new strategy was explored for the development of a new generic competency framework for a harmonised European curriculum in Obstetrics and Gynaecology. The generic competency framework was developed through action research. Data were collected by four European stakeholder groups (patients, nurses, midwives and hospital boards), using a variety of methods. Subsequently, the data were analysed further in consensus discussions with European specialists and trainees in Obstetrics and Gynaecology. These discussions ensured that the framework provides guidance, is specialty-specific, and that implementation in all European countries could be feasible. The presented generic competency framework identifies four domains: ‘Patient-centred care’, ‘Teamwork’, ‘System-based practice’ and ‘Personal and professional development’. For each of these four domains, guiding competencies were defined. The new generic competency framework is supported by European specialists and trainees in Obstetrics and Gynaecology, as well as by their European stakeholders. According to change management theories, it seems vital to allow room for re-invention and creative adaptation of the competency framework by medical professionals. Therefore, the generic competency framework offers guidance rather than prescription. The presented strategy for competency framework development offers leads for implementation of competency-based medical education as well as for development of innovations in postgraduate medical education in general. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071414125"

An online learning module on perioperative tobacco control was developed, in formats incorporating permutations of adaptive/non-adaptive and high/low interactivity (i.e., 2 × 2 factorial design). Participants (a national sample of US anesthesiology residents) were randomly assigned to module format. Primary outcomes included tobacco knowledge, time to complete the module, and self-efficacy in delivering tobacco interventions. One hundred fourteen residents completed the module, which required a median of 60 min (interquartile range 49, 138). The difference in post-module tobacco knowledge score was similar for adaptive and non-adaptive formats [mean difference 0.3 of 10 possible (95% CI − 0.3, 1.0), p = 0.25] but time was shorter for the adaptive format [− 7 min (95% CI − 14, 0), p = 0.01] and knowledge efficiency (knowledge score divided by time) was higher [0.08 units (95% 0.03, 0.14), p = 0.004]. The level of interactivity had no significant effect on self-efficacy [− 0.1 on a 5-point scale (95% CI − 0.3, 0.1), p = 0.50] in delivering tobacco interventions (both outcomes using 5-point scales). Adapting online instruction to learners’ prior knowledge appears to improve the efficiency of learning; adaptation should be implemented when feasible. Adding features that encourage learner interaction in an online course does not necessarily improve learning outcomes. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070083334"

Despite the development of best practice guidelines, some learners in the health professions still struggle to incorporate corrective feedback. To date, little research has been done to examine learner characteristics and how those traits might explain differences in feedback-related behavior. A qualitative study using a constructivist, grounded theory approach was conducted to examine the behaviors and learner characteristics that contribute to successful use of feedback. Medical and physician assistant students in their clinical years at one academic health center were interviewed to determine how they used feedback to learn. An overarching theory was developed to explain the process used by students who successfully used feedback. Participants needed to be ready, willing, and able to learn from feedback. Readiness required the learner to hear the corrective feedback without negative emotion and understand how to use the criticism. Willingness required a valuing process that resulted in meaning making. It also required motivation and a growth mindset. Able learners needed to utilize strategic learning behaviors to incorporate feedback into practice change. Barriers to feedback use included emotional interference, inability to create a positive narrative around the feedback encounter and understand it as part of a larger context, and the inability to utilize adaptive learning strategies. The paper considers important education theories, such as Self-regulated Learning and Achievement Goal Theory—theories that should be incorporated into future research. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074482437"

Most methods focus on aspects of the process of diagnostic reasoning, such as the relation between case features and diagnostic hypotheses. Inevitably, detailed elucidation of aspects of the process requires substantial time per case and limits the number of cases that can be examined given a limited testing time. Shifting assessment to the outcome of diagnostic reasoning, accuracy of the diagnosis, may serve as a reliable measure of diagnostic competence and would allow increased sampling across cases. The present study is a retrospective analysis of 7 large studies, conducted by 3 research teams, that all used a series of brief written cases to examine the outcome of diagnostic reasoning—the diagnosis. The studies involved over 600 clinicians ranging from final year medical students to practicing emergency physicians. For 4 studies with usable reliability data, reliability for a 2 h test ranged from.63 to.94. On average speeded tests were more reliable (.85 vs.73).To achieve a reliability of.75 required an average test time of 1.11 h for speeded tests and 1.99 for unspeeded tests. The measure was shown to be positively correlated with both written knowledge tests and measures of problem solving derived from OSCE performance tests. This retrospective analysis provides evidence to support the implementation of outcome-based assessments of clinical reasoning. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069639692"

Prior research has looked at using SPs to replace PEs. This paper reports on two studies that implement and evaluate a standardized patient (SP) scoring tool to augment PE scoring. The unique aspect of this study is that it explores the benefits of combining SP and PE scores. SP focus groups developed rating scales for four dimensions they labelled: Listening, Communication, Empathy/Rapport, and Global Impression. In Study I, 43 SPs from one site of a national PE-scored OSCE rated 60 examinees with the initial SP rating scales. In Study II, 137 SPs used slightly revised rating scales with optional narrative comments to score 275 examinees at two sites. Examinees were blinded to SP scoring and SP ratings did not count. Separate PE and SP scoring was examined using descriptive statistics and correlations. Combinations of SP and PE scoring were assessed using pass-rates, reliability, and decision consistency and accuracy indices. In Study II, SP and PE comments were examined. SPs showed greater variability in their scoring, and rated examinees lower than PEs on common elements, resulting in slightly lower pass rates when combined. There was a moderate tendency for both SPs and PEs to make negative comments for the same examinee but for different reasons. We argue that SPs and PE assess performance from different perspectives, and that combining scores from both augments overall reliability of scores and pass/fail decisions. There is potential to provide examinees with feedback comments from each group. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089659664"

The present study advances education in implementation science by compiling a competence profile for implementation practice and research and by exploring implementation experts’ sources of expertise. The competence profile is theoretically based on educational psychology, which implies the definition of improvable and teachable competences. In an online-survey, an international, multidisciplinary sample of 82 implementation experts named competences that they considered most helpful for conducting implementation practice and implementation research. For these competences, they also indicated whether they had acquired them in their professional education, additional training, or by self-study and on-the-job experience. Data were analyzed using a mixed-methods approach that combined qualitative content analyses with descriptive statistics. The participants deemed collaboration knowledge and skills most helpful for implementation practice. For implementation research, they named research methodology knowledge and skills as the most important ones. The participants had acquired most of the competences that they found helpful for implementation practice in self-study or by on-the-job experience. However, participants had learned most of their competences for implementation research in their professional education. The present results inform education and training activities in implementation science and serve as a starting point for a fluid set of interdisciplinary implementation science competences that will be updated continuously. Implications for curriculum development and the design of educational activities are discussed. © 2020, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085149081"

Residents experience shifting thresholds between variations that one surgeon holds firmly as principle and another takes more lightly as preference. Such variability has implications for surgical education, but the impact is not well understood. This is a critical problem to investigate as programs seek to define procedures for competency-based medical education (CBME) and improve learning through deliberate practice. Our study analyzes the emergence of procedural variation in an early-adopter CBME program through a situational analysis of tonsillectomy, a foundation level procedure in this otolaryngology, head and neck surgical program. An earlier phase of the study identified frequent variations (n = 12) on tonsillectomy among co-located surgeons who routinely perform this procedure (n = 6). In the phase reported here we interviewed these surgeons (n = 4) and residents at different stages of training (n = 3) about their experiences of these variations to map the relations of contributing social and material actors. Our results show that even a basic procedure resists standardization. This study contributes a sociomaterial grounded theory of surgical practice as an embodied response to conditions materialized by intra-relations of human and more-than-human actors. Shifting root metaphors about practice in surgical education from standardization to stabilization can help residents achieve stable-for-now embodiments of performance as their practice thresholds continue to emerge. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084854526"

Despite a plethora of evidence on the effectiveness of supervision, scant evidence for the impact of supervision training exists. While three previous literature reviews have begun to examine the effectiveness of supervision training, they fail to explore the extent to which supervision training works, for whom, and why. We adopted a realist approach to answer the question: to what extent do supervision training interventions work (or not), for whom and in what circumstances, and why? We conducted a team-based realist synthesis of the supervision training literature focusing on Pawson’s five stages: (1) clarifying the scope; (2) determining the search strategy; (3) study selection; (4) data extraction; and (5) data synthesis. We extracted contexts (C), mechanisms (M) and outcomes (O) and CMO configurations from 29 outputs including short (n = 19) and extended-duration (n = 10) supervision training interventions. Irrespective of duration, interventions including mixed pedagogies involving active and/or experiential learning, social learning and protected time served as mechanisms triggering multiple positive supervisor outcomes. Short-duration interventions also led to positive outcomes through mechanisms such as supervisor characteristics, whereas facilitator characteristics was a key mechanism triggering positive and negative outcomes for extended-duration interventions. Disciplinary and organisational contexts were not especially influential. While our realist synthesis builds on previous non-realist literature reviews, our findings extend previous work considerably. Our realist synthesis presents a broader array of outcomes and mechanisms than have been previously identified, and provides novel insights into the causal pathways in which short and extended-duration supervision training interventions produce their effects. Future realist evaluation should explore further any differences between short and extended-duration interventions. Educators are encouraged to prioritize mixed pedagogies, social learning and protected time to maximize the positive supervisor outcomes from training. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074936594"

However, it has yet to be critically examined as an alternative paradigm for medical education, which is how it was proposed. This commentary examines EBM on the terms on which it was originally advanced and within the context that gave rise to it, the problem-based learning (PBL) environment at McMaster University in the 1970s and 80s. The EBM educational prescription is revealed to be aligned with the information processing psychology (IPP) model of learning through acquisition of general problem solving skills that characterized the early McMaster version of PBL. The IPP model has been identified in the literature as discordant with an alternative, constructivist, model that emerged at Maastricht University in the Netherlands over the subsequent period. Strengths and weaknesses of EBM are identified from the standpoint of the underlying cognitive theories. Principles are proposed with which to guide an educationally viable approach to learning and teaching the valuable skills included within the original EBM formula. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Note","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074536700"

To identify any working conceptualisations that assessors use while assessing undergraduate medical students’ consultation skills and develop assessment tools based on assessors’ working conceptualisations and natural language for undergraduate consultation skills. In semi-structured interviews, 12 experienced assessors from a UK medical school populated a blank assessment scale with personally meaningful descriptors while describing how they made judgements of students’ consultation skills (at exit standard). A two-step iterative thematic framework analysis was performed drawing on constructionism and interactionism. Five domains were found within working conceptualisations of consultation skills: Application of knowledge; Manner with patients; Getting it done; Safety; and Overall impression. Three mechanisms of judgement about student behaviour were identified: observations, inferences and feelings. Assessment tools drawing on participants’ conceptualisations and natural language were generated, including ‘grade descriptors’ for common conceptualisations in each domain by mechanism of judgement and matched to grading rubrics of Fail, Borderline, Pass, Very good.

After reporting their diagnosis of a case, they were given immediate feedback. Participants were asked to verbalize their thoughts while completing the diagnosis and while they reflected on the provided feedback. The protocol analysis of their verbalizations showed that participants used some combination of four processes to interpret the case: gestalt interpretation, purposeful search, rule application, and reasoning from a prior case. All types of processes except reasoning from a prior case were applied significantly more frequently by experts. Further, gestalt interpretation was used with higher frequency in abnormal cases while purposeful search was used more often for normal cases.

It is unclear how the current promotion of workplace-based assessment as a pedagogical approach to promote learning has impacted this use of assessments for decision-making; meeting both these purposes may present unforeseen challenges. In this study we explored how supervisors make decisions on trainee progress in practice. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 supervisors of postgraduate anesthesia training across Australia and New Zealand and undertook thematic analysis of the transcripts. Supervisors looked beyond the formal assessment portfolio when making performance decisions. They instead used assessment ‘shadow systems’ based on their own observation and confidential judgements from trusted colleagues. Supervisors’ decision making involved expert judgement of the perceived salient aspects of performance and the standard to be attained while making allowances for the opportunities and constraints of the local learning environment. Supervisors found making progress decisions an emotional burden. When faced with difficult decisions, they found ways to share the responsibility and balance the potential consequences for the trainee with the need to protect their patients. Viewed through the lens of community of practice theory, the development of assessment ‘shadow systems’ indicates a lack of alignment between local workplace assessment practices and the prescribed programmatic assessment approach to high-stakes progress decisions. Avenues for improvement include cooperative development of formal assessment processes to better meet local needs or incorporating the information in ‘shadow systems’ into formal assessment processes. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072182564"

The current literature is limited in so far as it typically focuses on student perspectives within healthcare contexts and does not use the concept of ‘dignity’. Instead, this study explored student and supervisor perspectives on student dignity during WIL across healthcare and non-healthcare disciplines. Research questions included: What are: (1) types of student dignity experiences and patterns by groups; (2) factors contributing to experiences; (3) consequences of experiences? Sixty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted using narrative interviewing techniques with 30 supervisors and 46 students from healthcare (medicine, nursing and counselling) and non-healthcare (business, law and education) disciplines. Data were analyzed using framework analysis. Nine common narrative types were identified within 344 stories: verbal abuse, right for learning opportunities, care, inclusion, reasonable expectations, right for appropriate feedback, equality, trust, and right to be informed. Factors contributing to dignity experiences and consequences were often at the individual level (e.g. student/supervisor characteristics). We found some salient differences in perceptions of experiences between students and supervisors, but few differences between healthcare and non-healthcare disciplines.

Consequently, touching and being touched are also fundamental to healthcare practice. Despite a significant literature on touch, it is rarely conceptualized or discussed in terms of the student journey from layperson to practitioner. We chose to explore professional touch using the threshold concepts framework (TCF), which provides a theoretical model for exploring the way in which learners encounter, engage with and understand fundamental concepts in a discipline. This qualitative research synthesis (QRS) describes the use of the TCF to identify key issues involved in developing and using professional touch. Through a cross-professional analysis and synthesis of recent international literature, we aimed to identify key characteristics of the transitional journey for professional touch. Three orders of analysis were applied, employing a methodology described by Major and Savin-Baden (An introduction to qualitative research synthesis: managing the information explosion in social science research, Routledge, London, 2010). Following identification of threshold characteristics in the overall sample of articles, second order analysis revealed the nuances of professional touch associated with the characteristics. The final synthesis led to identification of five themes: touch as dialogue; being changed by touch; multiple boundaries of touch; multiple meanings of touch and influences on touch. Whilst providing support for some assertions within the literature, this QRS also offers new insights into the complexity of professional touch. Given the paucity of explicit learning and reflection around professional touch in training programmes of health professionals, the TCF reveals ways in which professional preparation might be improved to promote understanding of the role and impact of touch in practice. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069152114"

While debate remains as to whether tolerance of uncertainty is changeable or static, the prevailing conceptual healthcare tolerance of uncertainty model (Hillen et al. in Soc Sci Med 180:62–75, 2017) suggests that individuals’ tolerance of uncertainty is influenced by so-called moderators. Evidence regarding education’s role as a moderator of tolerance of uncertainty is, however, lacking. Preliminary work exploring medical students’ professional identity formation within anatomy learning identified tolerance of uncertainty as a theme warranting further exploration. Extending from this work, our research question was: How does the anatomy education learning environment impact medical students’ tolerance of uncertainty? To address this question, qualitative data were collected longitudinally across two successive cohorts through online discussion forums during semester and end of semester interviews. Framework analysis identified five stimuli of uncertainty, four moderators of uncertainty, and cognitive, emotional and behavioral responses to uncertainty with variable valency (positive and/or negative). Longitudinal data analyses indicated changes in stimuli, moderators and responses to uncertainty over time, suggesting that tolerance of uncertainty is changeable rather than static. While our findings support the Hillen et al. (Soc Sci Med 180:62–75, 2017) model in parts, our data extend this model and the previous literature. Although further research is needed about students’ development of tolerance of uncertainty in the clinical learning environment, we encourage medical educators to incorporate aspects of tolerance of uncertainty into curricular and learning environments. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085003065"

When adding individual scores to calculate final ranking, it is generally presumed that the values of possible scores on the evaluation grid are separated by constant intervals, following a linear function, although this assumption is seldom validated with raters themselves. Inaccurate interval values could lead to systemic bias that could potentially distort candidates’ final cumulative scores. The aim of this study was to establish rating scale values based on rater’s intent, to validate these with an independent quantitative method, to explore their impact on final score, and to appraise their meaning according to experienced MMI interviewers. A 4-round consensus-group exercise was independently conducted with 42 MMI interviewers who were asked to determine relative values for the 6-point rating scale (from A to F) used in the Canadian integrated French MMI (IFMMI). In parallel, relative values were also calculated for each option of the scale by comparing the average scores concurrently given to the same individual in other stations every time that option was selected during three consecutive IFMMI years. Data from the same three cohorts was used to simulate the impact of using new score values on final rankings. Comments from the consensus group exercise were reviewed independently by two authors to explore raters’ rationale for choosing specific values. Relative to the maximum (A = 100%) and minimum (F = 0%), experienced raters concluded to values of 86.7% (95% CI 86.3–87.1), 69.5% (68.9–70.1), 51.2% (50.6–51.8), and 29.3% (28.1–30.5), for scores of B, C, D and E respectively. The concurrent score approach was based on 43,412 IFMMI stations performed by 4345 medical school applicants. It provided quasi-identical values of 87.1% (82.4–91.5), 70.4% (66.1–74.7), 51.2% (47.1–55.3) and 31.8% (27.9–35.7), respectively. Qualitative analysis explained that while high scores are usually based on minor details of relatively low importance, low scores are usually attributed for more serious offenses and were assumed by the raters to carry more weight in the final score. Individual drop or increase in final MMI ranking with the use of new scale values ranged from − 21 to + 5 percentiles, with the average candidate changing by ± 1.4 percentiles. Consulting with experienced interviewers is a simple and effective approach to establish rating scale values that truly reflects raters’ intent in MMI, thus improving the accuracy of the instrument and contributing to the general fairness of the process. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084984090"

Originally, assessment was mainly seen as a measurement problem with the aim to tell people apart, the competent from the not competent. Logically, reproducibility or reliability and construct validity were seen as necessary and sufficient for assessment quality and the role of human judgement was minimised. Later, assessment moved back into the authentic workplace with various workplace-based assessment (WBA) methods. Although originally approached from the same measurement framework, WBA and other assessments gradually became assessment processes that included or embraced human judgement but based on good support and assessment expertise. Currently, assessment is treated as a whole system problem in which competence is evaluated from an integrated rather than a reductionist perspective. Current research therefore focuses on how to support and improve human judgement, how to triangulate assessment information meaningfully and how to construct fairness, credibility and defensibility from a systems perspective. But, given the rapid changes in society, education and healthcare, yet another evolution in our thinking about good assessment is likely to lurk around the corner. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094192776"

Trainee help-seeking plays a key role in supervisor oversight of trainee consultations. This study used focus groups and interviews with general practice supervisors to explore their approaches to trainee help-seeking and in-consultation supervision. Supervisor approaches are discussed under three themes: establishing a help-seeking culture; perceptions of in-consultation assistance required; and scripts for help provision. Within these themes, three interwoven entrustment processes were identified: supervisor entrustment; trainee self-entrustment; and ‘patient entrustment’ (patient confidence in the trainee’s clinical management). Entrustment appears to develop rapidly, holistically and informally in general practice training, partly in response to workflow pressure and time constraints. Typical supervisor scripts and etiquette for help-provision involve indirect, soft correction strategies to build trainee self-entrustment. These scripts appear to be difficult to adapt appropriately to under-performing trainees. Importantly, supervisor scripts also promote patient entrustment, increasing the likelihood of patients returning to the trainee and training practice for subsequent review, which is a major mechanism for ensuring patient safety in general practice. Theories of entrustment in general practice training must account for the interplay between supervisor, trainee and patient entrustment processes, and work-related constraints. Gaps between entrustment as espoused in theory, and entrustment as enacted, may suggest limitations of entrustment theory when extended to the general practice context, and/or room for improvement in the oversight of trainee consultations in general practice training. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089745351"

One pressing area where gaps and inequities are apparent is transgender (trans) people’s access to gender-affirming medicine such as hormones and surgeries. Reasons for the dire state of care include education gaps. While specific content knowledge has been identified as lacking in medical school curricula, less research has focused on the complex social practices required of clinicians and educators working in gender-affirming medicine, and how these skills are learned through practice. In order to inform health professions education in this key area of need, we conducted a study to better understand the social practices, and the learning that occurs therein, of gender-affirming medicine. We identified the work processes of 22 clinicians, clinician-educators, trans patients, and clinical care administrators with attention to how policies and protocols influenced practice, learning, and teaching. The results of our study elucidate: (1) that practicing of gender-affirming medicine is strictly dictated by standardized assessment protocols, which serve as a form of curriculum; and (2) how health professionals learn and teach health advocacy as a form of resistance to protocols identified as creating inequities. These findings suggest an opportunity to view protocols—and their inherent limitations—more deliberately as teaching and learning tools, specifically for learning advocacy. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066460499"

Therefore, instructors must intentionally incorporate team-based skill building into their courses, using teaching strategies like team-based learning (TBL). An assumption of TBL is that team dynamics facilitate learning; however, limited research has examined this connection. The primary purposes of this mixed-methods evaluation were: (a) to describe the characteristics of team dynamics in a graduate-level research methods course that employs a modified TBL approach, and (b) to examine the association between team dynamics and student grades. Given the importance of preparing health professional students to work collaboratively in their careers, a secondary aim was to examine how team skills developed through a team-based learning approach could be transferred to other courses and to future jobs. We conducted surveys on team dynamics at mid-semester (n = 64) and the end of the semester (n = 66), collected students’ grades for the final paper and overall course, and conducted 4 focus groups with Master of Public Health students (n = 25). Paired t tests were used to examine change in team dynamics and correlations were conducted to assess the relationship between team dynamics and grades. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes related to team dynamics from the focus group data. Overall, students reported experiencing positive and beneficial team dynamics. The findings support two main underlying categories of team dynamics, interpersonal team processes and task orientation, and the linkages between the categories that allow teams to function. Team dynamics scores were not associated with student grades. However, students recognized the value of practicing team skills in preparation for future group work and jobs. These findings suggest that active learning approaches, such as TBL, can help to facilitate the acquisition of collaborative skills. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074822780"

However, there is little known about the effects on clinicians when conflict occurs with their students. What do clinicians perceive to be major causes of these conflicts? How do they react when and after conflict occurs? A phenomenological inquiry exploring the lived experience of 12 clinician teachers in medical schools was performed. The clinicians were selected using purposeful sampling and snowballing techniques. The interviews revolved around discussions based on episodes of conflict with medical students that the clinicians considered significant. The analysis and emergent themes were partially constructed around and informed by theories of conflict, and conflict management. A number of themes emerged from this study. Clinicians experienced that significant psychological and behavioural problems of students had a dominant impact on the likelihood and severity of conflict; these conflicts had a significant emotional impact on clinicians; though the responses to conflict varied, “avoidance” was a mechanism commonly used by clinicians and thus the assessment of attitudinal and behavioural professional issues in the workplace was problematic. This study shows how the clinician perspective to challenging student/clinician encounters impacts on the quality of education they are able to provide. We recommend medical schools consider these issues when designing their programs in order to develop and maintain clinician–teacher engagement and participation. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074288076"

However, enduring controversies regarding the purpose, efficacy, and implementation of humanities initiatives suggest that the timing and context of trainees’ exposure to such content is a key, but seldom considered, factor. To better understand the affordances of introducing humanities-based health curriculum prior to the HPE admissions gateway, we conducted a qualitative instrumental case study with participants from Canada’s first Health Humanities baccalaureate program. Fully anonymized transcripts from semi-structured interviews (n = 11) and focus groups (n = 14) underwent an open-coding procedure for thematic narrative analysis to reveal three major temporal domains of described experience (i.e., prior to, during, and following their participation in a 12-week semester-long “Introduction to Health Humanities” course). Our findings demonstrate that perceptions of arts- and humanities content in health education are generated well in advance of HPE admission. Among other findings, we define a new concept—epistemological multicompetence—to describe participants’ emergent capability to toggle between (and advocate for the role of) multiple disciplines, arts and humanities particularly, in health-related teaching and learning at the pre-professional level. Improved coordination of baccalaureate and HPE curricula may therefore enhance the development of capabilities associated with arts and humanities, including: epistemological multicompetence, aesthetic sensibility, and other sought-after qualities in HPE candidates. In conclusion, attending to the pre-professional admissions gateway presents a new, capabilities-driven approach to enhancing both the implementation and critical understanding of arts and humanities’ purpose, role, and effects across the “life course” of health professions education. © 2020, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096890773"

However, the relative importance of social ties among team-members for patient satisfaction remains unknown. In this study, we explored the association between social ties within emergency teams performing simulated caesarean sections (CS) and patient-actor satisfaction. Two hundred seventy-two participants were allocated to 33 teams performing two emergency CSs in a simulated setting. We collected data on social ties between team-members, measured as affective, personal and professional ties. Ties were rated on 5-point Likert scales. In addition, participants’ clinical experience, demographic data and their knowledge about team members’ roles were surveyed. Perceived patient satisfaction was measured on a 5-point Likert scale. Data was analysed with a linear regression model using elastic net regularization. In total, 109 predictor variables were analysed including 84 related to social ties and 25 related to clinical experience, demographics and knowledge test scores. Of the 84 variables reflecting social ties, 34 (41%) had significant association with patient satisfaction, p < 0.01. By contrast, a significant association with patient satisfaction was found for only one (4%) of the 25 variables reflecting clinical experience, demographics and knowledge of team roles. Affective ties and personal ties were found to be far more important predictors in the statistical model than professional ties and predictors relating to clinical experience. Social ties between emergency team members may be important predictors of patient satisfaction. The results from this study help to enhance our conceptual understanding of social ties and their implications for team-dynamics. Our study challenges existing views of team-performance by placing emphasis on achieving collective competence through affective and personal social ties, rather than focusing on traditional measures of expertise. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074943924"

This common view of Med Ed research is echoed and reinforced by the narrative used by leading Med Ed departments and research centres to describe their activities as “interdisciplinary.” Bibliometrics offers an effective method of investigating scholarly communication to determine what knowledge is valued, recognized, and utilized. By empirically examining whether knowledge production in Med Ed research draws from multiple disciplines and research areas, or whether it primarily draws on the knowledge generated internally within the field of Med Ed, this article explores whether the characterisation of Med Ed research as interdisciplinary is substantiated. A citation analysis of 1412 references from research articles published in 2017 in the top five Med Ed journals was undertaken. A typology of six knowledge clusters was inductively developed. Findings show that the field of Med Ed research draws predominantly from two knowledge clusters: the Applied Health Research cluster (made of clinical and health services research), which represents 41% of the references, and the Med Ed research cluster, which represents 40% of the references. These two clusters cover 81% of all references in our sample, leaving 19% distributed among the other knowledge clusters (i.e., Education, disciplinary, interdisciplinary and topic centered research). The quasi-hegemonic position held by the Applied Health and Med Ed research clusters confines the other sources of knowledge to a peripheral role within the Med Ed research field. Our findings suggest that the assumption that Med Ed research is an interdisciplinary field is not convincingly supported by empirical data and that the knowledge entering Med Ed comes mostly from the health research domain. © 2020, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086870011"

We highlight the principles informing scoping reviews and outline how epistemology—the aspect of philosophy that “deals with questions involving the nature of knowledge, the justification of beliefs, and rationality”—should guide methodological considerations, toward the aim of ensuring the production of a high-quality review with defensible and appropriate conclusions. To contextualize our claims, we illustrate some of the methodological challenges we have personally encountered while executing a scoping review on clinical reasoning and reflect on how these challenges could have been reconciled through a broader understanding of the methodology’s philosophical foundation.

We explored how program directors (PDs) justify decisions about whether they would trust finishing Post Graduate Year 1 (PGY1) residents to care for the PD or a loved one.Using an end of year survey with validity evidence, we assessed PDs’ responses (Yes, No, Not Sure) and written comments about this entrustment decision for USUHS medical students from graduating classes of 2013–2015 (PGY1). We performed a qualitative inductive content analysis to identify themes in how PDs justified their decisions as well as descriptive statistics and a contingency table analysis to examine associations between trust decisions and election to membership in Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA), or conversely, referral to the Student Promotions Committee (SPC) for remediation. Qualitative analyses revealed five themes related to this trust decision about medical residents: personal, interpersonal, knowledge, competence, and developmental. Neither AOA status, nor SPC referral status was significantly associated with the trust measure, overall, but positive trust decisions were significantly higher among those elected to AOA than in those who were not. Positive trust decisions were significantly associated with AOA status but negative trust decisions were not significantly associated with referral to the SPC. This study offers insights into what attributes may underpin trust decisions by PDs. Our findings suggest that PDs’ frequent use of personal and interpersonal characteristics to justify trust decisions contrasts with the use of clinical and knowledge based assessments during undergraduate medical education (UME), and emphasize the importance of critical intrinsic abilities. © 2020, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079378569"

PBL focuses on promoting abilities such as clinical reasoning, team skills and metacognition. PBL also aims to foster self-directed learning and deep learning as opposed to rote learning. This has incentivized researchers in assessment to find possible solutions. Originally, these solutions were sought in developing the right instruments to measure these PBL-related skills. The search for these instruments has been accelerated by the emergence of competency-based education. With competency-based education assessment moved away from purely standardized testing, relying more heavily on professional judgment of complex skills. Valuable lessons have been learned that are directly relevant for assessment in PBL. Later, solutions were sought in the development of new assessment strategies, initially again with individual instruments such as progress testing, but later through a more holistic approach to the assessment program as a whole. Programmatic assessment is such an integral approach to assessment. It focuses on optimizing learning through assessment, while at the same gathering rich information that can be used for rigorous decision-making about learner progression. Programmatic assessment comes very close to achieving the desired constructive alignment with PBL, but its wide adoption—just like PBL—will take many years ahead of us. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074365360"

By comparing resident and faculty perceptions of feedback opportunities within one internal medicine residency training program, we sought to understand whether and how principles underlying meaningful feedback could be supported or constrained across a variety of feedback opportunities. Using case-study qualitative methodology, interviews and focus groups were conducted to explore 19 internal medicine residents’ and 7 faculty members’ perceptions of feedback across a variety of feedback opportunities: coaching, mini-CEXs, in-training evaluation reports and routine clinical supervision. Our data analysis moved iteratively between developing conceptual understandings and fine-grained analyses, while attending to both deductive and inductive analysis. Our results suggest that all feedback opportunities, including those created through formalized assessments, can foster meaningful feedback if faculty establish a trusting relationship with the resident, base their feedback on direct observation and support resident learning. However, formalized assessments were often perceived as inhibiting the conditions for meaningful feedback. A coaching program provided a context in which meaningful feedback could arise, in part because faculty were supported in shifting their focus from patient to resident. Meaningful feedback in clinical education may be fostered across a variety of feedback opportunities, however, it is often constrained by assessment. We must consider whether increasing the frequency of formative assessments may inhibit efforts to improve our feedback cultures while, in contrast, freeing up faculty to focus on supporting resident learning could improve these cultures. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077145964"

However, the potential to bias future assessments has been raised as a concern. The purpose of this study is to determine whether prior performance information such as LH influences the assessment of learners in the clinical context. Between December 2017 and June 2018, forty-two faculty members and final-year residents from the Department of Medicine at the University of Ottawa were assigned to one of three study groups through quasi-randomisation, taking into account gender, speciality and rater experience. In a counter-balanced design, each group received either positive, negative or no LH prior to watching six simulated learner–patient encounter videos. Participants rated each video using the mini-CEX and completed a questionnaire on the raters’ general impressions of LH. A significant difference in the mean mini-CEX competency scale scores between the negative (M = 5.29) and positive (M = 5.97) LH groups (P <.001, d = 0.81) was noted. Similar findings were found for the single overall clinical competence ratings. In the post-study questionnaire, 22/28 (78%) of participants had correctly deduced the purpose of the study and 14/28 (50%) felt LH did not influence their assessment. LH influenced mini-CEX scores despite raters’ awareness of the potential for bias. These results suggest that LH could influence a rater’s performance assessment and careful consideration of the potential implications of LH is required. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086774677"

This call for greater alignment is not unique to the health professions. Researchers within the field of higher education have long wrestled with the complexities of aligning professional learning and workplace concerns. In this study, we extend this critical line of inquiry to explore the possible conceptual intersections between two CE programs acting within a single healthcare organization. Both programs are concerned with improving patient care, primarily by changing the ways professionals think and talk with one another. However, the two programs have different historical origins: one in a workplace, the other within a university setting. Introducing the concept of “modes of ordering” as a way to analyze the curricula, we argue the programs are operating through separate logics of learning. We label these two modes of ordering: (1) learning as standardization and (2) learning as identification. Through our discussion, we explore how these different modes demand different roles for educators and participants. Ultimately, we argue that both have value. However, we also argue that educators require conceptual tools to sensitize them to the possibility of competing logics of learning and the subsequent implications for their practice as educators. In conclusion, we offer the metaphor of CE educator as choreographer, connecting concepts and practices within these logics in productive ways while continually navigating the various learning imperatives acting on professionals at any given time. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077625809"

Here, learning becomes more self-driven, meaningful and relevant, pertaining to the social accountability principle of higher education. Being popular worldwide and driven by a strong demand for medical education reform during the past two decades, PBL has rapidly swept across the medical education communities in Asian countries. Many medical schools in Asia were drawn in by the innovative pedagogical methodology that PBL embraces, but tended to neglect with time, often unintentionally, the philosophy that PBL embodies. As a result, PBL in Asia, for various local academic, cultural, economic and administrative reasons started drifting away from its intended educational purposes. Consequently, the acceptance and practice of PBL in Asia has taken compromised forms as PBL-hybrids embedded within long existing and incorrigibly traditional curricula, or other less effective forms for easier implementation and management, at the expense of SCL and SDL. PBL in health sciences education, which has had a 50-year flourishment in the West, remains a continuous struggle in Asia. PBL for health science education in Asia is certainly no panacea, and is probably heading for a thorny path, despite the ultimate hope for a promising future. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074652694"

However, this process is not always straightforward. Learning takes place in complex contexts, requiring practitioners to overcome various motivational, systemic, emotional, and social barriers to the application of knowledge. This paper explores the mechanisms through which individuals translate knowledge into action to provide insight into why disconnects between knowledge and action can arise. As a critical review, the aim was to draw on key literature from multiple fields to analyse and synthesize existing schools of thought and lay a strong conceptual foundation on which knowledge to action gaps might be considered. We iteratively consulted clinicians and experts in various fields to guide literature searches focused on theoretical perspectives that could inform educational and research efforts around knowledge-to-action gaps. Key theoretical perspectives on motivation address when and how individuals decide to take action. Literatures from cognitive science address how clinicians and learners self-regulate to (sometimes) overcome barriers to action. Sociocultural theories examine the ways in which action might be prevented by social norms that conflict with what the individual knows and believes, potentially also giving rise to counter-normative action. No single perspective will entirely explain how health professionals and learners implement knowledge in practice. As a result, the authors offer multiple lenses through which to view the problem, and then propose how each of these lenses might better guide educational and research efforts to untangle this challenging but important issue. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064057788"

Phenomenology allows clinicians to strip away assumptions, habits of thinking, and normative ideas within the clinical encounter in order to enter the descriptive world of the patient. In suspending presuppositions and heuristics, the clinician can better empathize with the vivid, embodied stories that the patient is describing. Finally, the practice of phenomenology makes tangible the complexities of medical illnesses, emotions, and lived experiences. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074517983"

Despite its’ successful implementation worldwide, many institutions still encounter problems in their daily teaching practices that limit deep learning in students. This raises the question: How else can we look at PBL practice and research? The main argument of this reflective paper is to better align PBL practice with the theories or principles of contextual, constructive, self-directed and collaborative learning. This paper explains what these principles or theories are. In addition, it discusses a new way to bridge theory and practice: design-based research (DBR), which combines redesigning theory-based teaching practices with investigating these practices in close collaboration with various stakeholders. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to address the problems encountered in PBL. We should be very careful in drawing conclusions about which PBL approach works best.

They are feedback-, not decision-oriented, and should hold little consequences to a learner based on their performance. The use of low-stakes assessment as a learning opportunity requires an environment in which continuous improvement is encouraged. This may be hindered by learners’ perceptions of assessment as high-stakes. Teachers play a key role in learners’ assessment perceptions. By investigating assessment perceptions through an interpersonal theory-based perspective of teacher–learner relationships, we aim to better understand the mechanisms explaining the relationship between assessment and learning within medical education. First, twenty-six purposefully selected learners, ranging from undergraduates to postgraduates in five different settings of programmatic assessment, were interviewed about their assessment task perception. Next, we conducted a focussed analysis using sensitising concepts from interpersonal theory to elucidate the influence of the teacher–learner relationship on learners’ assessment perceptions. The study showed a strong relation between learners’ perceptions of the teacher–learner relationship and their assessment task perception. Two important sources for the perception of teachers’ agency emerged from the data: positional agency and expert agency. Together with teacher’s communion level, both types of teachers’ agency are important for understanding learners’ assessment perceptions. High levels of teacher communion had a positive impact on the perception of assessment for learning, in particular in relations in which teachers’ agency was less dominantly exercised. When teachers exercised these sources of agency dominantly, learners felt inferior to their teachers, which could hinder the learning opportunity. To utilise the learning potential of low-stakes assessment, teachers are required to stimulate learner agency in safe and trusting assessment relationships, while carefully considering the influence of their own agency on learners’ assessment perceptions. Interpersonal theory offers a useful lens for understanding assessment relationships. The Interpersonal Circumplex provides opportunities for faculty development that help teachers develop positive and productive relationships with learners in which the potential of low-stakes assessments for self-regulated learning is realised. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074684693"

One example is research on productive failure, a teaching strategy that asks learners to attempt to generate solutions to difficult problems before receiving instruction. This study compared the effectiveness of productive failure with indirect failure to further characterize the underpinning cognitive mechanisms of productive failure. Year one pharmacy students (N = 42) were randomly assigned to a productive failure or an indirect failure learning condition. The problem of estimating renal function based on serum creatinine was described to participants in the productive failure learning condition, who were then asked to generate a solution. Participants in the indirect failure condition learned about the same problem and were given incorrect solutions that other students had created, as well as the Cockcroft–Gault formula, and asked to compare and contrast the equations. Immediately thereafter all participants completed a series of tests designed to assess acquisition, application, and preparation for future learning (PFL). The tests were repeated after a 1-week delay. Participants in the productive failure condition outperformed those in the indirect failure condition, both on the immediate PFL assessment, and after a 1-week delay. These results emphasize the crucial role of generation in learning. When preparing novice students to learn new knowledge in the future, generating solutions to problems prior to instruction may be more effective than simply learning about someone else’s mistakes. Struggle and failure are most productive when experienced personally by a learner because it requires the learner to engage in generation, which deepens conceptual understanding. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095999443"

Effective intervention methods are therefore needed to support students in improving their image reading skills for OPTs. To this end, we developed a compare-and-contrast intervention, which aimed at supporting students in achieving full coverage when visually inspecting OPTs and, consequently, obtaining a better diagnostic performance. The comparison entailed a static eye movement visualization (heat map) on an OPT showing full gaze coverage from a peer-model (other student) and another heat map showing a student’s own gaze behavior. The intervention group (N = 38) compared five such heat map combinations, whereas the control group (N = 23) diagnosed five OPTs. Prior to the experimental variation (pre-test) and after it (post-test), students in both conditions searched for anomalies in OPTs while their gaze was recorded. Results showed that students in the intervention group covered more areas of the OPTs and looked less often and for a shorter amount of time at anomalies after the intervention. Furthermore, they fixated on low-prevalence anomalies earlier and high-prevalence anomalies later during the inspection. However, the students in the intervention group did not show any meaningful improvement in detection rate and made more false positive errors compared to the control group. Thus, the intervention guided visual attention but did not improve diagnostic performance substantially. Exploratory analyses indicated that further interventions should teach knowledge about anomalies rather than focusing on full coverage of radiographs. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085921013"

However, what comprises professional identities is rarely interrogated. This research tackles this relatively understudied component of professional identities research by understanding emergency medicine physicians’ perspectives on the important elements that comprise their professional identities. Q-methodology was used to identify different clusters of viewpoints on professional identities; by extension, the core components that comprise emergency medicine physicians’ professional identities are disclosed. Thirty-three emergency medicine physicians were recruited, through purposive sampling, from five hospitals across Taiwan. R software was used to analyse the Q-sorts, determine loadings on each viewpoint and formulate the viewpoint array. Analysis of interview data enhanced our understanding of these viewpoints. In total, twenty-five emergency medicine physicians loaded onto four distinct viewpoints, reflecting dominant perspectives of emergency medicine physicians’ understanding of their professional identities. These distinct viewpoints demonstrated what emergency medicine physicians deemed significant in how they understood themselves. The viewpoints comprised: skills acquisition, capabilities and practical wisdom; coping ability and resilience; professional recognition and self-esteem; and wellbeing and quality of life. All viewpoints stressed the importance of trust between colleagues. These findings demonstrate the multitude of ways in which seemingly unified professional identities diverge across groups of individuals. An enhanced understanding of speciality work culture is gained. By understanding facets of professional identities, the development of future educational interventions and departmental initiatives, which might support key components of professional identities, can be explored. © 2020, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084301274"

Medical student cohorts can include students who enter medicine from a previous career, i.e. with developed professional identities and who are usually older and more mature. Students with previously developed professional identities may have specific challenges in negotiating their new ‘doctor’ identity. This study examined the development of professional identity in mature medical students who had a variety of previous careers prior to entering medical school. A narrative inquiry was undertaken using interviews of mature medical students with backgrounds that included physiotherapy, clinical physiology, public health and nutrition, and the armed forces. A narrative analysis was conducted combining both thematic and structural perspectives using linguistics and positioning theory as interpretive tools. Three main themes emerged that portray the development processes that arise in this cohort as they develop their medical professional identity: holding back aspects of the previous self; foregrounding aspects of the previous self; and developing new aspects towards forming a ‘new’ self. These themes and their implications are discussed in the context of current literature, highlighting some of the specific challenges that this cohort faces in developing their medical identity. We argue that dedicated faculty and student development be offered, exploring how professional identity formation in mature medical students can be facilitated and supported, so staff and students are better equipped to engage and shape mature students’ professional identity in a meaningful way. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074956022"

Economics significantly shapes the way we behave and think as educators and learners and so there is increasing interest in using economic ways of thinking and approaches to examine and understand how choices are made, the influence of constraints and boundaries in educational decision making, and how costs are felt. Thus, in this article, we provide a brief historical overview of modern economics, to illustrate how the core concepts of economics—scarcity (and desirability), rationality, and optimization—developed over time. We explain the important concept of bounded rationality, which explains how individual, meso-factors and contextual factors influence decision making. We then consider the opportunities that these concepts afford for health professions education and research.

Yet, the development of PBL is not a series of success stories, but rather a journey of experiments, failures and lessons learned. In this paper, we analyzed the meta-analyses and systematic reviews on PBL from 1992 to present as they provide a focused lens on the PBL research in the past 5 decades. We identified three major waves in the PBL research development, analyzed their impact on PBL research and practice, and offered suggestions of research gaps and future directions for the field. The first wave of PBL research (polarization: 1990–mid 2000) focused on answering the question “Does PBL work?” and the outcomes. The results were conflicting. The researchers took polarizing positions and debated over the merits of PBL throughout this wave. However, the contradictory results and the debates in fact pushed the researchers to look harder for new directions to solve the puzzle. These efforts resulted in the second wave (from outcomes to process: mid 2000–mid 2010) that focused on the question “How does PBL work?” The second wave of PBL research targeted at investigating the effects of implementation constituents, such as assessment formats or single versus curriculum wide implementations. The third wave (specialization: mid 2010 and onward) of PBL research focused on “How does PBL work in different specific contexts?” These research widened our perspectives by expanding our understanding of how PBL manifests itself in different contexts. Given the diversification of PBL and more hybrid PBL models, we suggest “Why does PBL with particular implementation characteristics for specific outcomes work or not work in the condition where it is implemented?” to be the question to answer in the next wave of PBL research. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076199714"

While the goals are clear—to produce the health workforce that society needs to improve health outcomes—both education and healthcare systems continue to evolve concurrently amidst changes in knowledge, skills, population demographics and social contracts. In observing a significant anniversary of this journal, which sits at the junction of education and healthcare systems, it is appropriate to reflect on how the relationship is evolving. Health professions educators must listen to the voices of regulators, employers, students and patients when adapting to new service delivery models that emerge in response to pressures for change. The recent COVID-19 pandemic is one example of disruptive change, but other factors, such as population pressures and climate change, can also drive innovations that result in lasting change. Emerging technology may act as either a servant of change or a disruptor. There is a pressing need for interdisciplinary research that develops a theory and evidence base to strengthen sustainability of change. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096717471"

Newly qualified doctors feel required to make decisions before owning their new identity. It is essential to understand how responsibility relates to identity formation to improve transitions for doctors and patients. This multiphase ethnographic study explores realities of transition through anticipatory, lived and reflective stages. We utilised Labov’s narrative framework (Labov in J Narrat Life Hist 7(1–4):395–415, 1997) to conduct in-depth analysis of complex relationships between changes in responsibility and development of professional identity. Our objective was to understand how these concepts interact. Newly qualified doctors acclimatise to their role requirements through participatory experience, perceived as a series of challenges, told as stories of adventure or quest. Rules of interaction within clinical teams were complex, context dependent and rarely explicit. Students, newly qualified and supervising doctors felt tensions around whether responsibility should be grasped or conferred. Perceived clinical necessity was a common determinant of responsibility rather than planned learning. Identity formation was chronologically mismatched to accepting responsibility. We provide a rich illumination of the complex relationship between responsibility and identity pre, during, and post-transition to qualified doctor: the two are inherently intertwined, each generating the other through successful actions in practice. This suggests successful transition requires a supported period of identity reconciliation during which responsibility may feel burdensome. During this, there is a fine line between too much and too little responsibility: seemingly innocuous assumptions can have a significant impact. More effort is needed to facilitate behaviours that delegate authority to the transitioning learner whilst maintaining true oversight. © 2020, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078261811"

However, the twenty-first century goal of sustainable education poses a challenge to PBL, especially as it relates to isolation. Here we discuss the underlying issue of isolation in three respects. First, the information-processing model of PBL depends on generalized skills, whereas real life problem-solving skills involve context-bound cognitive processes. Second, in all models of PBL, the focus on knowledge acquisition for a specific problem improves performance but separates education from the world at large. Third, the existing culture of measurement strengthens the aforementioned isolating effects. In response, we introduce a conceptual approach based on Hannah Arendt’s technical notion of ‘world’. We make suggestions to meet the criteria of sustainable education by reconnecting PBL to our shared world, and emphasizing a responsibility for this shared world. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074520057"

The cognitive psychology of learning consists of activation of prior knowledge while processing new information and elaboration on the resulting new knowledge to facilitate storing in long-term memory. This process is limited by the size of working memory. Six interventions based on cognitive theory that facilitate learning and expertise development are discussed: (1) Fostering self-explanation, (2) elaborative discussion, and (3) distributed practice; (4) help with decreasing cognitive load, (5) promoting retrieval practice, and (6) supporting interleaving practice. These interventions contribute in different measure to various instructional methods in use in medical education: problem-based learning, team-based learning, worked examples, mixed practice, serial-cue presentation, and deliberate reflection. The article concludes that systematic research into the applicability of these ideas to the practice of medical education presently is limited and should be intensified. © 2020, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85096532043"

Despite its constraints (overcrowding and unpredictable workload, in particular), the emergency department (ED) should be viewed as an opportune place for improving patient satisfaction and adherence to recommendations, and thus for preventing complications and early readmission, suggesting that better PE and health information could be one way to enhance patient safety. Building evidence on how best to organise and deliver effective PE poses many challenges, however. This paper gives an overview of the main issues (what we already know and prospects for research/clinical approaches) concerning PE in the ED: improving provider skills, ensuring PE continuity, developing educational materials, interprofessional collaboration, identifying specific educational needs for certain subgroups of patients, evaluating PE delivery, and identifying the most effective interventions. Future research will be needed to develop evidence-based guidelines for a comprehensive approach to PE. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065161105"

The relationship between student and patient, with a supportive preceptor as a resource, can influence the progression and development of an authentic person-centred approach to care among students. The purpose of this study was to analyse the congruence between nursing students’ and patients’ views of their relationship during students’ clinical placement. The study compared data from cross-sectional matched cohort pairs of nursing students (n = 187) and patients (n = 187) in Finland. The data were collected between March 2015 and May 2016 using corresponding questionnaires and procedures in both cases. Both students’ and patients’ views were moderately or weakly congruent in terms of facilitative relationship, characterised as a mutually enriching relationship for both students and patients through dialogue. Patients, however, tended to see the relationship significantly more often as mechanistic, focusing on students learning practical skills, compared to students who saw the relationship more often as facilitative. Patients’ age and the reasons for care were the only background variables that predicted the congruence between students’ and patients’ views of their relationships. These findings suggest ways in which student–patient relationships can be made more meaningful in supporting learning in clinical education. © 2020, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085323781"

Disabled peoples’ participation in healthcare professions is limited by assumptions about disability. Little research explores how healthcare professions can be organized to support disabled peoples’ employment. Within a critical realist paradigm influenced by grounded theory, this study used interviews to explore the experiences of 56 disabled healthcare clinicians and students, and advance a conceptual taxonomy of disability experience within healthcare professions. Participants describe their experiences of disability in the healthcare professional context in terms of characteristics and dimensions of disability—how characteristics interact with factors within healthcare training and practice environments. We profile two particularly salient dimensions of the disability experience: visibility and onset of disability. These are developed to describe complexity and specificity of the experiences of individuals negotiating the healthcare context. Among participants there is extensive heterogeneity related to the experience of disability in healthcare professional contexts. Despite some having similar disability characteristics, no two individuals experience the same combination of characteristics and dimensions of disability. Given the complexity of experiences for disabled healthcare professionals/students, a taxonomy for conceptualizing this experience is presented. Readers are encouraged to consider the taxonomy through which they might conceptualize individual, embodied, and socially embedded experiences of disabled healthcare professionals and students. Stakeholders involved in healthcare professions and education should consider this shift in perspective, with a view to increasing access of disabled people to health professional practice. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073968095"

The current study applies the early work of Jurgen Habermas and his knowledge-constitutive interests as a lens to explore an educational approach where physician-educators were asked to make their expert reasoning visible to emergency medicine trainees, to more deliberately make visible and accessible the context-specific thinking that emergency physicians routinely use. An action research methodology was used. The ‘making thinking visible’ teaching approach was introduced to five emergency medicine educators working in large public hospital emergency departments. Participants were asked to trial this teaching method and document its impact on student learning over two reporting cycles. Based on written reports of trialing the teaching approach, participants identified a need to change from: (1) introducing thinking structures to cultivating enquiry; and, (2) providing explanations based on cognitive thinking routines towards encouraging the learner to see the relevance of the clinical context. Educators described how they developed a more diagnostic and reflexive approach to learners, recognized the need to cultivate independent thinking, and valued the opportunity to reflect on their usual teaching. Teaching clinical reasoning using the ‘making thinking visible’ approach prompted educators to decrease the emphasis on providing technical information to assisting learners to understand the purposes and meanings behind clinical reasoning in emergency medicine. The knowledge-constitutive interests work of Jurgen Habermas was found to provide a robust framework supporting this emancipatory teaching approach. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078920603"

Yet, such clarity does not mean roles are fixed within teams and some literature suggests role flexibility can enhance team functioning. Interprofessional practice competencies and learning activities often emphasize knowledge and definition of roles, but rarely attend to the dynamic nature of roles and influential contextual factors. This study explores role fluidity in interprofessional student groups using an activity theory framework. Using a collective instrumental case study approach, the authors examine the fluidity of one physical therapy (PT) student’s role within 3 different interprofessional (medical, pharmacy, PT) student groups completing nursing home patient care plans. Field notes, group debriefing interviews, and care plans were collected and coded from all care planning sessions. Codes mapped to group-specific activity systems that compared role-influencing interactions and tensions. The PT student’s role fluidity varied in each group’s activity system, influenced primarily by system tensions from implicit rules (e.g., encouraging questions), division of labor (e.g., rigid profession-based task assignment), and tool use (e.g., computers).

To provide guidance to faculty pursuing careers as educators, we sought to explore perceived factors that contributed to the career development of outstanding medical educators. Using a thematic analysis, investigators at two institutions interviewed 39 full or associate professor physician faculty with prominent roles as medical educators in 2016. The social cognitive career theory (SCCT) informed the interview guide. Investigators developed the codebook and performed iterative analysis using qualitative methods. Extensive team discussion generated the final themes. Eight themes emerged related to preparation, early successes, mentors, networks, faculty development, balance, work environment, and multiple identities. Preparation led to early successes, which served as “launch points,” while mentors, networks, and faculty development programs served as career accelerators to open more opportunities, and a supportive work environment was an additional enabler of this pathway. Educators who reported balance between work and outside interests described boundary setting as well as selectively choosing new opportunities to establish boundaries in mid-career. Participants described multiple professional identities, and clinician and educator identities tended to merge and reinforce each other as careers progressed. This study revealed common themes describing trajectories of success among medical educators. These themes aligned with the SCCT, and typically replayed and spiraled over the course of the educators’ careers. These findings resonate with other studies, lending credence to an approach to career development that can be shared with junior faculty who are exploring careers in medical education. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077906572"

First, project-PBL may enhance student engagement and motivation by allowing them to direct their own learning. Second, project-PBL may help students develop metacognitive competencies by forcing them to collaborate and regulate learning in settings without a facilitator. Finally, project-PBL may foster skills and competencies related to medical research. As illustrated through a brief example from Aalborg University, Denmark, students learn differently from project-PBL and case-PBL, and so one implementation cannot simply replace the other.

However, this component is rarely presented in educational surgical videos. It is unknown whether affectively engaging students by including patient-related emotionally salient information potentiates or draws focus away from learning a surgical procedure and whether such information affects motivation and attitudes toward the video. Therefore, we investigate whether presenting a patient’s emotional state before video surgery enhances or weakens the educational value of that video. In a within-subjects crossover design, second-year medical students (n = 130) viewed video clips of surgeries. These videos, from online medical education platforms, were preceded by the patient’s information from the original video or by information about the patient’s preoperative emotional preparation. After each video, participants completed a multiple-choice test about the video’s content to measure learning, answered a question about their motivation to re-watch the video, and completed an attitude scale regarding the video. Incorporating patient’s information into surgical videos significantly enhanced students’ acquisition of the technical aspects of surgery procedures (p < 0.0001), motivation to re-watch the video (p < 0.001), and favorable attitudes toward the video (p = 0.02). These findings show that incorporating information about patients’ emotional states may enhance students’ positive attitudes and motivations toward educational videos and may improve their learning of surgical techniques. They also suggest that the role of this factor should be considered when developing guidelines for medical educational video release. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078615266"

Therefore, the early identification of potential dropout students is important. The contribution of personal features to dropout rates has merited exploration. However, there is a paucity of research on aspects of student experience that may lead to dropping out. In this study, underpinned by theoretical models of student commitment, involvement, and engagement, we explored the hypothesis of using inferior participation as an indicator of a higher probability of dropping out in year 1. Class participation was calculated as an aggregate score based on teachers’ daily observations in class. The study used a longitudinal dataset of six cohorts of high-school entry students (N = 709, 67% females) in one medical school with an annual intake of 120 students. The findings confirmed the initial hypothesis and showed that lower scores of class participation in year 1 added predictive ability to pre-entry characteristics (Pseudo-R                             2                              raised from 0.22 to 0.28).

The implications for practice are that teachers’ ratings of class participation can play a role in indicating medical students who may eventually drop out. We conclude that the scores of class participation can contribute to flagging systems for the early detection of student dropouts.                          © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056346023"

While each of these approaches has uniquely contributed to the advancement of patient care, this pluralism is not without tension. Evidence-based medicine is not necessary individualized; personalized medicine may be individualized but is not necessarily person-centered. As novel technologies and big data continue to proliferate today, the focus of medical practice is shifting away from the dialogic encounter between doctor and patient, threatening the loss of humanism that many view as integral to medicine’s identity. As medical trainees, we struggle to synthesize medicine’s diverse and evolving ‘ways of knowing’ and to create a vision of doctoring that integrates new forms of medical knowledge into the provision of person-centered care. In search of answers, we turned to twentieth-century philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer, whose unique outlook on “health” and “healing,” we believe, offers a way forward in navigating medicine’s ‘messy pluralism.’ Drawing inspiration from Gadamer’s emphasis on dialogue and ‘practical wisdom’ (phronesis), we initiated a dialogue with the dean of our medical school to address the question of how medical trainees and practicing clinicians alike can work to create a more harmonious pluralism in medicine today. We propose that implementing a pluralistic approach ultimately entails ‘bridging’ the current divide between scientific theory and the practical art of healing, and involves an iterative and dialogic process of asking questions and seeking answers. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045425875"

Reflexivity brings historical, institutional, and socio-cultural influences on clinical activities to the fore, enabling consideration of new possibilities. Continuing education methodologies that encourage reflexivity may improve clinical practice and trainee learning, but are rare. We piloted a dialogical methodology with a children’s rehabilitation team to foster reflexivity (patient population: young people with Duchenne’s or Becker’s muscular dystrophy). The methodology involved three facilitated, interactive dialogues with the clinical team. Each dialogue involved clinicians learning to apply a social theory (Mol’s The Logic of Care) to ethnographic fieldnotes of clinical appointments, to make routine practice less familiar and thus open to examination. Discourse analyses that preserve group dynamics were completed to evaluate the extent to which the dialogues spurred reflexive dialogue within the team. Overall, imagining impacts of clinical care on people’s lives—emphasized in the social theory applied to fieldnotes—showed promise, shifting how clinicians interpreted routine practices and spurring many plans for change. However, this reflexive orientation was not sustained throughout, particularly when examining entrenched assumptions regarding ‘best practices’. Clinicians defended institutional practices by co-constructing the metaphor of balancing logics in care delivery. When invoked, the balance metaphor deflected attention from emotional, social, and moral impacts of clinical care on patients and their families. Emergent findings highlight the value of analysing reflexivity-oriented dialogues using discourse analysis methods. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047340007"

Autonomous motivation (acting out of true interest or personal endorsement) is associated with better learning and academic performance. This study examined whether study strategy (surface, achieving, and deep) was a mediator between the type of motivation (autonomous and controlled motivation) and academic performance (GPA and clerkship performance), and whether these relations are different for students from different ethnic groups to gain a better understanding about the needed intervention/support in the curriculum. Data was gathered from 947 students at VUmc School of Medical Sciences, Amsterdam. Structural Equation Modelling was performed to test the hypothesized model: a higher autonomous motivation has a positive association with academic performance through deep and achieving strategy, and has a negative association with performance through surface strategy. The model with the outcome variables GPA and clerkship performance had a good fit (n = 618; df = 1, RMSEA = 0.000, p = 0.43). The model for the ethnic majority and minority groups was significantly different (p < 0.025). In this study, autonomous motivation had a positive association with GPA through achieving strategy for the ethnic majority students only. It might be that the size of the minority groups was too small to detect differences or that other factors mediate these relations in ethnic minority students. Qualitative research is needed to identify other factors influencing the academic performance of ethnic minority students and what they experience during their education, in order to support their learning in the right manner. © 2018, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050665928"

The implementation of regulated learning is essential for students to cope with medical course environment and succeed. This study aimed to investigate the reciprocal relationships between self-regulated learning skills (SRLS) and academic workload (AW) across secondary school to medical school transition. Freshmen enrolled in medical school (N = 102) completed questionnaires at the beginning and at the end of their academic year, assessing AW (measured as study time hours and perceived workload), SRLS (planning and strategies for learning assessment, motivation and action to learning and self-directedness) and academic achievement. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and a longitudinal path analysis were performed. According to the EFA, study time and perceived workload revealed two factors of AW: students who had a high perceived workload also demonstrated increased study time (tandem AW); and those who had a low perceived workload also demonstrated increased study time (inverse AW). Only a longitudinal relationship between SRLS and AW was found in the path analysis: prior self-directedness was related to later tandem AW. Moreover, success during the first year of medical school is dependent on exposure to motivation, self-directedness and high study time without overload during secondary school and medical school, and prior academic achievement. By better understanding these relationships, teachers can create conditions that support academic success during the first year medical school. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045420072"

This study aimed to examine the prevalence of academic procrastination among undergraduates in health professions, and explore the mediation effects of self-efficacy for self-regulation and fear of failure in the relationship between self-esteem and academic procrastination. A cross-sectional design was used to study 1184 undergraduates in health professions from China. Participants completed measures of academic procrastination, self-esteem, self-efficacy for self-regulation and fear of failure. We used Pearson product-moment correlation to examine the bivariate correlations between study variables, and path analysis to examine mediation. Among the 1184 undergraduates, 877 (74.1%) procrastinated on at least one type of academic task. The total score for academic procrastination was negatively correlated with scores for self-esteem and self-efficacy for self-regulation, and positively correlated with the score for fear of failure. Moreover, the relationship between self-esteem and academic procrastination was fully mediated by self-efficacy for self-regulation (indirect effect: β = −.15, 95% bootstrap CI −.19 to −.11) and fear of failure (indirect effect: β = −.06, 95% bootstrap CI −.09 to −.04). These findings suggest that interventions targeting the enhancement of self-efficacy for self-regulation and the conquest of fear of failure may prevent or reduce academic procrastination among undergraduates in health professions, especially for those with lower self-esteem. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047667860"

The preclinical medical curriculum at the University of Kansas Medical Center uses a two-exam system for summative assessments in which students test, revisit material, and then re-test (same content, different questions), with the higher score used to determine the students’ grades. Using a quasi-experimental design and data collected during the normal course of instruction, test and re-test scores from midterm multiple choice examinations were compared between academic year (AY) 2015–2016, which provided delayed feedback with the correct answer only, and AY 2016–2017, where delayed feedback consisted of the correct answer plus a rationale. The average increase in score on the re-test was 2.29 ± 6.83% (n = 192) with correct answer only and 3.92 ± 7.12% (n = 197) with rationales (p < 0.05). The effect of the rationales was not different in students of differing academic abilities based on entering composite MCAT scores or Year 1 GPA. Thus, delayed feedback with exam question rationales resulted in a greater increase in exam score between the test and re-test than feedback with correct response only. This finding suggests that delayed elaborative feedback on a summative exam produced a small, but significant, improvement in learning, in medical students. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050633541"

As a result, physicians are ill-equipped to consider costs. This study sought input from practicing physicians on perceived deficiencies in current teaching and recommendations for necessary content to include in medical teaching. We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using semi-structured interviews utilizing a purposeful maximum variation sample of cardiologists and neonatologists practicing in diverse settings. We analyzed interviews using conventional content analysis. 18 cardiologists and 17 neonatologists participated in this study. Respondents perceived that current teaching does not impart sufficient knowledge of value and cost considerations to achieve patient-centered, high-value decision-making. They identified the following priority areas for education related to healthcare costs: the business of medicine and information about out-of-pocket patient costs, training in health research interpretation skills to critically appraise evidence, and communication skills to engage patients as partners in shared decision-making. Participants recommended a variety of teaching methods, including didactic sessions on core topics, role modeling and case studies. American physicians perceive learning needs related to the incorporation of costs into clinical decision-making that can inform curriculum development initiatives in this field. Physicians perceive knowledge of these topics and skills to be crucial to achieving patient-centered high-value care. Concomitant health system reforms supporting the needs of the patient at its center are essential to enable physicians to focus on a patient-centered approach to healthcare delivery. © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066812972"

Therefore, the authors further explored how residents experience their own well-being in relation to their professional and personal life. The authors conducted a qualitative study based on a phenomenological approach. From June to October 2013, 13 in-depth interviews were conducted with residents in various training programs using a semi-structured interview guide to explore participants’ experience of their well-being in relation to their professional life. The data were collected and analyzed through an iterative process using the thematic network approach. Effort–reward balance and perceived autonomy were dominant overarching experiences in influencing residents’ well-being. Experiencing sufficient autonomy was important in residents’ roles as caregivers, as learners and in their personal lives. The experienced effort–reward balance could both positively and negatively influence well-being. We found two categories of ways that influence residents’ experience of well-being; (1) professional lives: delivering patient care, participating in teamwork, learning at the workplace and dealing with the organization and (2) personal lives: dealing with personal characteristics and balancing work–life. In residents’ well-being experiences, the effort–reward balance and perceived autonomy are crucial. Additionally, ways that influence residents’ well-being are identified in both their professional and personal lives. These dominant experiences and ways that influence well-being could be key factors for interventions and residency training adaptations for enhancing residents’ well-being. © 2018, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051852551"

Over three decades later, we conducted a comprehensive, systematic review of the validity evidence gathered since then. The evidence was compiled according to the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing’s five sources of validity evidence, namely, Content, Response process, Internal structure, Relations to other variables, and Consequences, to which we added two other types related to Cost-feasibility and Acceptability. Of the 457 publications that referred to the KFs approach between 1984 and October 2017, 164 are cited here; the remaining 293 were either redundant or the authors simply mentioned the KFs concept in relation to their work. While one set of articles reported meeting the validity standards, another set examined KFs test development choices and score interpretation. The accumulated validity evidence for the KFs approach since its inception supports the decision-making construct measured and its use to assess clinical decision-making skills at all levels of training and practice and with various types of exam formats. Recognizing that gathering validity evidence is an ongoing process, areas with limited evidence, such as item factor analyses or consequences of testing, are identified as well as new topics needing further clarification, such as the use of the KFs approach for formative assessment and its place within a program of assessment. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047156438"

In this study we move away from the theoretical notions of criteria, concepts and guidelines to adopt an ontological approach which seeks to stay as close to the lived experience as possible. Our research asked 12 participants from a variety of health disciplines to tell their stories of working interprofessionally. We sought to glean meaning from the lived experience. Our phenomenological hermeneutic approach and interpretation were informed by Heidegger and Gadamer. Rather than offering a thematic overview, in this article we share three stories from the research that were congruent with other stories. The first, told by a doctor, is of a resuscitation in an emergency department. It shows how the effective working together of the interprofessional team was more than each member following a resuscitation protocol. There was ‘something’ about how they worked together that made this story stand out, even though the patient died. The second story showcases how ‘who’ the person is makes a difference. This nurse makes an effort to get to know other staff as people, to find common interests. In such a way interprofessional practice comes to flourish. The third story shows how a physiotherapist and a psychologist joined in conversation to seek innovative possibilities for a challenging situation. In such a way each built on the others expertise and were excited at the success they achieved for the patient. From these ontological accounts we have come to see that interprofessional practice flourishes when practitioners are their authentic, caring selves.

Lack of preparation hinders both individual learning and team performance during TBL. The purpose of the present study was to explore how the grading of the individual readiness assurance test (iRAT) can affect pre-class preparation, iRAT performance and performance in the end-of-year examination. Using a quasi-experimental design, Year 1 and 2 students’ download frequency for their pre-class materials, performance on iRAT and examination were examined under two conditions; (1) under which the iRAT was graded and (2) under which the iRAT was ungraded. Medical students (N = 220) from three cohorts were included in the study. Differences between both conditions were tested by means of six separate ANCOVAs, using medical school entry test scores as the covariate to account for potential cohort effects. Results revealed that students were downloading more pre-class materials prior to their TBL sessions, and were performed significantly better on iRAT when their performance was graded, even after controlling for cohort effects. Analysis of covariance demonstrated that performance on iRAT also appeared to affect performance on their examination scores. The results of the study suggest that grading has a positive effect on students’ iRAT scores.

As a case in point, at its inception, Problem Based Learning was hailed as a major curriculum innovation, with the promise of enormous gains in learning outcomes. Very quickly, ecclesiastical debates arose as what was true PBL and what was “modified PBL”. Ironically, systematic reviews conducted fairly early in its evolution showed that the gains in learning outcome from PBL were neither large nor uniform (Vernon and Blake in Acad Med 68:550–563, 1993), and the most consistent finding was greater student satisfaction. In this paper, we review five decades of experience with the first PBL curriculum at McMaster. We point out how the curriculum has evolved, both theoretically and practically, in response to external influences, based both on empirical evidence and practical demands.

By fostering the acquisition of “negative knowledge” about typical cognitive errors in the medical reasoning process, we support learners in avoiding future erroneous decisions and actions in similar situations. Since learning from errors is based on self-explanation activities, we provided additional prompting procedures to foster the effectiveness of the error-based instructional approach. The extent of instructional support in a web-based learning environment with erroneous clinical case examples was varied in a one-factorial design with three groups by either presenting the cases as (a) unsupported worked examples or by providing the participants with (b) closed prompts in the form of multiple-choice tasks or (c) with open reflection prompts during the learning process. Despite significant learning progress in all conditions, neither prompting procedure improved the learning outcomes beyond the level of the unsupported worked example condition. In contrast to our hypotheses, the unsupported worked example condition was the most effective with respect to fostering clinical reasoning performance. The effects of the learning conditions on clinical reasoning performance was mediated by cognitive load, and moderated by the students’ self-efficacy. Both prompting procedures increased extraneous cognitive load. For learners with low self-efficacy, the prompting procedures interfered with effective learning from errors. Although our error-based instructional approach substantially improved clinical reasoning, additional instructional measures intended to support error-based learning processes may overtax learners in an early phase of clinical expertise development and should therefore only be used in moderation. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059858790"

However, there are contentious views on how to implement it. In addition, there is scanty evidence on how students experience it and how they develop the ability to integrate learning. In this paper, students’ experiences of integration are explored. Using a phenomenographic approach, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with students and teachers in an undergraduate medical programme. Analysis of data revealed the “outcome space”—a collective of students’ experiences. Using the “anatomy of awareness” framework, the experiences were structured according to how students experience the meaning of integration of learning; the abilities that they perceive are needed to carry it out; the acts of learning that for them are associated with these abilities; and internal and external factors which they perceive to facilitate or hinder it. The research revealed five conceptions of integration and abilities to achieve it, developing with increasing sophistication over time. Teachers’ experiences with the curriculum generally supported the students’ experiences. To facilitate integrative learning, starting earlier in the programme, intentional contextually directed interventions are suggested. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052496663"

One view is that errors result from unconscious application of cognitive heuristics; the alternative is that errors are a consequence of knowledge deficits. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of checklists that (a) identify and address cognitive biases or (b) promote knowledge retrieval, as a means to reduce errors in ECG interpretation. Novice postgraduate year (PGY) 1 emergency medicine and internal medicine residents (n = 40) and experienced cardiology fellows (PGY 4–6) (n = 21) were randomly allocated to three conditions: a debiasing checklist, a content (knowledge) checklist, or control (no checklist) to be used while interpreting 20 ECGs. Half of the ECGs were deliberately engineered to predispose to bias. Diagnostic performance under either checklist intervention was not significantly better than the control. As expected, more errors occurred when cases were designed to induce bias (F = 96.9, p < 0.0001). There was no significant interaction between the instructional condition and level of learner. Checklists attempting to help learners identify cognitive bias or mobilize domain-specific knowledge did not have an overall effect in reducing diagnostic errors in ECG interpretation, although they may help novices. Even when cognitive biases are deliberately inserted in cases, cognitive debiasing checklists did not improve participants’ performance. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061064158"

However, research into the impact of such courses on identity formation of healthcare professionals is limited. This study investigates the influence of such programmes on graduates’ educational identities, practices and career progression. Informed by constructivist grounded theory (CGT), semi-structured interviews were conducted with 27 graduates (2008–2012) from one postgraduate programme, who were at different stages in their careers worldwide. The audio data were transcribed and analysed using a CGT approach. Participants enrolled in award-bearing medical education courses for various intrinsic and extrinsic reasons. The findings from this study highlight their development as educators, and educational researchers, leaders and learners, as their self-efficacy in educational practices and engagement in scholarly activities increased. Graduates attributed career progression to the qualification, with many being promoted into senior positions. They also described substantial performance attainments in the workplace. The findings contribute to understanding the complexity and nuances of educational identity formation of healthcare professionals. A qualification in medical education encouraged transformational changes and epistemological development as an educator. Awareness of these findings will inform both those considering enrolment and those supporting them of potential benefits of these programmes. © 2018, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042125242"

Both are variable, however, emanating from assessment judgements. One established source of variability is “contrast effects”: scores are shifted away from the depicted level of competence in a preceding encounter. The shift could arise from an effect on the range-frequency of assessors’ internal scales or the salience of performance aspects within assessment judgments. As these suggest different potential interventions, we investigated assessors’ cognition by using the insight provided by “clusters of consensus” to determine whether any change in the salience of performance aspects was induced by contrast effects. A dataset from a previous experiment contained scores and comments for 3 encounters: 2 with significant contrast effects and 1 without. Clusters of consensus were identified using F-sort and latent partition analysis both when contrast effects were significant and non-significant. The proportion of assessors making similar comments only significantly differed when contrast effects were significant with assessors more frequently commenting on aspects that were dissimilar with the standard of competence demonstrated in the preceding performance. Rather than simply influencing range-frequency of assessors’ scales, preceding performances may affect salience of performance aspects through comparative distinctiveness: when juxtaposed with the context some aspects are more distinct and selectively draw attention. Research is needed to determine whether changes in salience indicate biased or improved assessment information. The potential should be explored to augment existing benchmarking procedures in assessor training by cueing assessors’ attention through observation of reference performances immediately prior to assessment. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049578285"

The first metatheory conceives of truth in terms of coherence (rationality, consistency): a body of knowledge is true when it contains no inconsistencies and has at least some credibility. The second metatheory conceives of truth as correspondence, i.e., empirical accuracy. The two metatheories supplement each other, but are also incommensurable, i.e., they cannot be expressed in each other’s terms, for they employ completely different criteria to establish truth (Englebretsen in Bare facts and naked truths: a new correspondence theory of truth, Routledge, London, 2005). We will discuss both the role of both metatheories in medicine, in particular in medical education in a clinical context. In line with Hammond’s view (Med Decis Mak 16(3):281–287, 1996a; Human judgment and social policy: irreducible uncertainty, inevitable error, unavoidable injustice, Oxford University Press, New York, 1996b), we will extend the two metatheories to two forms of competence: coherence competence and correspondence competence, and demonstrate that distinguishing these two forms of competence increases our insights as to the best way to teach undergraduate students clinical problem solving. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060540807"

One way to explore resolving this issue is to consider whether variables of problem scenario design can be altered to optimize motivation. This mixed method study considered the impact of presentation modality of the PBL problem subject (i.e., the key character involved in the problem) on student motivation within the context of Speech and Voice Science curricula for forty-six undergraduate students at a midwestern, US university. The frequency of verbal and non-verbal engagement behaviors was monitored during four consecutive PBL problems. The problems were designed to provide increasing levels of social presence and used varied case presentation modalities (e.g., paper, audio-visual, face to face). Although the frequency of engagement behaviors declined during the study and fatigue appeared to play a role, most students identified problems with combination of higher subject presence (i.e., audio-visual, face-to-face) and challenging content as motivating. Students were able to develop a sense of ownership and responsibility for their problem-solving efforts with a problem designed with direct interaction (i.e., face to face) with the problem subject. This study sheds light on the impact of affective problem features (e.g., emotion, personal psychological connection) on students’ motivation in the presence of fatigue, which is often undervalued during the design of PBL modules. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064620574"

However, medical students often struggle to understand physiological concepts. Interactive learning through Peer instruction (PI) is known to stimulate students’ comprehension, but its relative efficacy and working mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated if and how PI could optimize comprehension of physiological concepts and transfer relative to Self-explanation (SE) which is considered a lower-order type of overt learning. First-year medical students (n = 317) were randomly assigned to either PI or SE in a pre-post test design, followed by a set of near and far transfer questions. In both PI and SE groups post-test scores were significantly improved (p < 0.0001) with PI outperforming SE (+ 35% vs. + 23%, p = 0.006). Interestingly, a substantial number of students with initial incorrect answers even had enhanced scores after discussion with an incorrect peer. Both methods showed higher transfer scores than control (p = 0.006), with a tendency for higher near transfer scores for PI. These findings support PI as a valuable method to enhance comprehension of physiological concepts. Moreover, by comparing the effects of interactive PI with constructive SE we have established new insights that complement educational theories on overt learning activities. © 2018, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055743156"

When interpreting repeated assessment data displayed as learning curves, a key assessment question is: “How well is each learner learning?” We outline the validity argument and investigation relevant to this question, for a computer-based repeated assessment of competence in electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation. We developed an on-line ECG learning program based on 292 anonymized ECGs collected from an electronic patient database. After diagnosing each ECG, participants received feedback including the computer interpretation, cardiologist’s annotation, and correct diagnosis. In 2015, participants from a single institution, across a range of ECG skill levels, diagnosed at least 60 ECGs. We planned, collected and evaluated validity evidence under each inference of Kane’s validity framework. For Scoring, three cardiologists’ kappa for agreement on correct diagnosis was 0.92. There was a range of ECG difficulty across and within each diagnostic category. For Generalization, appropriate sampling was reflected in the inclusion of a typical clinical base rate of 39% normal ECGs. Applying generalizability theory presented unique challenges. Under the Extrapolation inference, group learning curves demonstrated expert–novice differences, performance increased with practice and the incremental phase of the learning curve reflected ongoing, effortful learning. A minority of learners had atypical learning curves. We did not collect Implications evidence. Our results support a preliminary validity argument for a learning curve assessment approach for repeated ECG interpretation with deliberate and mixed practice. This approach holds promise for providing educators and researchers, in collaboration with their learners, with deeper insights into how well each learner is learning. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052843169"

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, ERIC, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Communication and Mass Media Complete (CMMC), key journals, and bibliographic databases. The effect sizes (ESs) were extracted and pooled in random effects meta-analyses. We assessed the quality of the study using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI). From 34,737 articles, 9 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The overall effect size for CST was 0.611 (95% CI 0.327–0.895), and it was statistically significant (p = 0.000). We found based on the subgroup analyses that CST has a large effect size when it used stand-alone courses, lecture-lab based courses, video recordings, feedback, training for 2 or more semesters, hours per week ≥5 h and external assessments. For the CST effect, the effect sizes were ranked in order of confidence, knowledge, skills, and attitudes. The result of the meta-regression is that the total number of attendees is significantly negatively correlated with the effect sizes of the CST. The findings of the present meta-analysis provide evidence that CST in pharmacy education may act as an efficient way to improve the communication competency of students, and it may serve as a guide for pharmacy educators. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029537065"

We evaluated three supports for self-regulated simulation-based training: practice schedules, normative comparisons, and learning goals. Participants practiced 5 endoscopy tasks on a physical simulator, then completed 4 repetitions on a virtual reality simulator. Study A compared two practice schedules: sequential (master each task in assigned order) versus unstructured (trainee-defined). Study B compared normative comparisons framed as success (10% of trainees were successful) versus failure (90% of trainees were unsuccessful). Study C compared a time-only goal (go 1 min faster) versus time + quality goal (go 1 min faster with better visualization and scope manipulation). Participants (18 surgery interns, 17 research fellows, 5 medical/college students) were randomly assigned to groups. In Study A, the sequential group had higher task completion (10/19 vs. 1/21; P <.001), longer persistence attempting an ultimately incomplete task (20.0 vs. 15.9 min; P =.03), and higher efficiency (43% vs. 27%; P =.02), but task time was similar between groups (20.0 vs. 22.6 min; P =.23). In Study B, the success orientation group had higher task completion (10/16 vs. 1/24; P <.001) and longer persistence (21.2 vs. 14.6 min; P =.001), but efficiency was similar (33% vs. 35%; P =.84). In Study C, the time-only group had greater efficiency than time + quality (56% vs. 41%; P =.03), but task time did not differ significantly (172 vs. 208 s; P =.07). In this complex motor task, a sequential (vs. unstructured) schedule, success (vs. failure) orientation, and time-only (vs. time + quality) goal improved some (but not all) performance outcomes. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056002091"

We previously found that early patient educator exposure helped to shape the understanding of patient-centredness in pre-clerkship learners. We now expand on this work to evaluate whether there is persistence of initial perceptions and to explore general reflections on longer-term impacts of early patient educator exposures once learners are immersed in the clinical phase of their training. In this follow-up study, we conducted group interviews with a sample of learners who wrote reflections as part of their pre-clerkship patient educator experience. We explored how perspectives on patient educators changed over time, and determined which themes identified during pre-clerkship remained relevant to clinical trainees. Audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed thematically using a hybrid inductive and deductive analysis to construct a thematic framework derived through a method of constant comparison. We identified three new themes: “value of early clinical experience”, “change in learners’ perspectives”, and “valuing and applying CanMEDS roles other than Medical Expert”. Themes from pre-clerkship that remained relevant included: “patients’ perspective humanizes disease”, “patients’ experiences with navigating the healthcare system”, “learners’ perceptions of the learning strategy”, and “inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the learning experience.” Many themes identified in pre-clerkship learners remain relevant in early clinical trainees. Further, insights from pre-clerkship experiences with patient educators evolve as learners experience clerkship with definite shifts in emphasis and new perspectives. This work illuminates the utility of patient educators for those considering this strategy for supporting the development of patient-centredness in undergraduate medical education. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050698402"

This study investigated relationships between the personal factors of achievement goal orientations, achievement emotions, and attention to feedback in BioWorld, a computer environment for learning clinical reasoning. Novice medical students (N = 28) completed questionnaires to measure their achievement goal orientations and then thought aloud while solving three endocrinology patient cases and reviewing corresponding expert solutions. Questionnaires administered after each case measured participants’ experiences of five feedback emotions: pride, relief, joy, shame, and anger. Attention to individual text segments of the expert solutions was modelled using logistic regression and the method of generalized estimating equations. Participants did not attend to all of the feedback that was available to them. Performance-avoidance goals and shame positively predicted attention to feedback, and performance-approach goals and relief negatively predicted attention to feedback. Aspects of how the feedback was displayed also influenced participants’ attention.

Trainees rely on cues to make monitoring judgments to self-regulate their performance. Ideally, cues and monitoring judgements accurately reflect performance, as measured by cue diagnosticity (the ability of a cue to predict performance) and monitoring accuracy (the ability of a monitoring judgement to predict performance). However, this process is far from perfect, emphasizing the need for more accurate cues and monitoring judgements. Perhaps the mental effort of a task could be a cue used to inform certainty judgements. The purpose of this study is to measure cue utilization and cue diagnosticity of mental effort and monitoring accuracy of certainty for self-regulation of performance. Focused on the task of ECG interpretation, 22 PGY 1-3 Internal Medicine residents at McMaster University provided a diagnosis for 10 ECGs, rating their level of certainty (0–100%) and mental effort (Paas scale, 1–9). 220 ECGs completed by 22 participants were analyzed using path analysis. There was a negative moderate path coefficient between certainty and mental effort (β = − 0.370, p < 0.001), reflecting cue utilization. Regarding cue diagnosticity of mental effort, this was reflected in a small negative path coefficient between mental effort and diagnostic accuracy (β = − 0.170, p = 0.013). Regarding monitoring accuracy, a moderate path coefficient was observed between certainty and diagnostic accuracy (β = 0.343, p < 0.001). Our results support mental effort as a cue and certainty as a monitoring judgement for self-regulated performance. Yet, reported correlations are not very high. Future research is needed to identify additional cues. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048271608"

Expectations of what students should learn become re-contextualised and translated into entry-level curriculum, with students operating as a connection between what is intended and enacted in curriculum, and required in the real world. Drawing on phenomenology, this paper explores how students understand practice—the collective, purposeful knowing, doing and being of a community—in entry-level physiotherapy programs. Ways of thinking and practising (WTP)—a framework attentive to the distinctive nature of a discipline, its values, philosophies and world-view (McCune and Hounsell in High Educ 49(3):255–289, 2005)—provides the conceptual lens. Six themes describing how students see the WTP of physiotherapy practice emerged from the analysis: discovery of new knowledge; problem solving client related contexts; adopting a systems based approach to the body; contributing to a positive therapeutic alliance; developing a sense of self and the profession; and the organisation of the workforce. The study produces knowledge about practice by focusing on physiotherapy students’ experiences of disciplinary learning. Including students in educational research in this way is an approach that can help students realise their potential as part of a community of practice. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85037627722"

A cross-country comparison of accreditation systems could provide valuable input into policy development processes. We reviewed the accreditation systems of five countries: The United States, Canada, The United Kingdom, Germany and Israel. We used three information sources: a literature review, an online search for published information and applications to some accreditation authorities. We used template analysis for coding and identification of major themes. All five systems accredit according to standards, and basically apply the same accreditation tools: site-visits, annual data collection and self-evaluations. Differences were found in format of standards and specifications, the application of tools and accreditation consequences. Over a 20-year period, the review identified a three-phased process of evolution—from a process-based accreditation system, through an adaptation phase, until the employment of an outcome-based accreditation system. Based on the five-system comparison, we recommend that accrediting authorities: broaden the consequences scale; reconsider the site-visit policy; use multiple data sources; learn from other countries’ experiences with the move to an outcome-based system and take the division of roles into account. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064165639"

Internal motivational factors for studying medicine (e.g., care for patients, save lives) coupled with a deep approach to learning have been positively related to empathy in contrast to external motivational factors (e.g., future earning potential, prestige) and surface learning. However, assessments of these assumptions among medical school candidates are scarce. This study examined the relationship between different motivational factors and empathy among students enrolled in a selection year in medicine by testing the mediating role of learning approaches. A sample of 572 candidates for medical studies answered a self-reported questionnaire half way through their selection year. Measures included internal and external motivational factors for studying medicine, deep and surface learning approaches and empathy. Path-analysis tested the mediation effects of deep and surface approaches to learning on the relationship of internal and external motivational factors with empathy. The deep learning approach partially mediated the significant positive association between internal motivational factors and empathy, while the surface learning approach fully mediated the significant negative association between external motivational factors and empathy. These results suggest that learning approaches could be a pathway by which internal and external motives for studying medicine are related to empathy among medical school candidates. Pedagogical strategies and educational environments accounting for individual differences in motivation and learning may contribute to training students to become professional and caring doctors in the future. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056658658"

While the professional regulation and standardization of Allied Health Professionals’ education in high-income countries has captured scholarly attention, the study of paramedic practice is still in its infancy and there is a need to explore its evolvement in relation to the fluid societal–political circumstances affecting its provision and demand. Based on interviews with front-line paramedics, paramedic educators and paramedic science students in the South of England, this article examines how the reforms to paramedic education have impacted the professionalization of paramedics and their discourse of professionalism. Framed within to the ‘new’ sociology of professions, the case of British paramedics demonstrates the complex nature of the relationship between the university and professional practice. It appears that universities, the providers of paramedic education, are caught between two opposing discourses of professionalism: on the one hand, that of providing a platform for students’ socialization and engagement with professionalism ‘from within’ practice which is based on students’ common goals and mutual experiences, and, on the other hand, serving as a conduit for managerial/organizational strategies of professionalism which appear to undermine the role of university socialization. © 2017, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033493677"

Current discourse promotes feedback as an interactive, dialogic process between the learner and the learning partner. While much has been written about effective feedback, less is known about key elements that support dialogic feedback. It is therefore important to investigate what is known about the elements that guide best practice for effective feedback. A scoping review of the extant literature following Arksey and O’Malley’s methodology was conducted. A search of literature published in English identified sixty-one publications eligible for this review. Publications were representative of the international literature from both empirical and non-empirical sources. Feedback elements were extracted from the included publications and categorised into 11 core attributes. The attributes identified feedback as: being a process; criteria-based; requiring multiple forms and sources of data/evidence; needs to be desired by the recipient (i.e. invited and welcomed); timely; responsive to the learner (i.e. tailored to developmental needs/learning preferences of the learner); frequent; future-focussed; reciprocal (i.e. two-way); involves skilful interaction; and is multidimensional (i.e. engages the learner in more than one way). Despite the rhetoric on feedback as a ‘dialogic process’, a gap remains in our understanding around what is required to engage the learner as an equal partner in the feedback process. Further research exploring the impact of specific aspects of the feedback process on practice is required. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054533589"

How, why and to what end students, in the context of today’s culturally and linguistically diverse cohorts, interact with members of clinical workplace communities during clinical workplace learning is not well understood. The aim of this research was to generate a theoretical understanding of students’ interactive processes in clinical workplace learning that accounted for high levels of cultural/linguistic diversity. In accordance with constructivist grounded theory methods, data collection and analysis were premised on theoretical sampling and constant comparative analysis, and undertaken from an informed and reflexive stance. This involved iterations of survey, interview and diary data from two diverse cohorts of final year veterinary students who had undergone 11 months of clinical workplace learning. Clinical preceptors were also interviewed. As an aid to theory building, testing and refinement, and in order to test the theory’s relevance, usefulness and transferability beyond veterinary clinical education, critical feedback was sought from medical and allied health educators. Our substantive level theory demonstrates that upon entering the clinical workplace community, students learn how to ‘harness dialogue’ in order to effectively coordinate three, inter-related interactive processes: (i) functioning in the workplace, (ii) impression management and (iii) learning-in-the-moment. We found both positive and negative consequences ensued, depending on how students harnessed dialogue. The theory responds to a perceived need in international student education to move away from a deficit discourse by developing educational theory which focuses on the nature of participation, rather than the nature of the student. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065129055"

Traditionally the educational relationship between student and clinical educator has been considered one-way, with students being the ones that benefit. This review focuses on the areas of clinician practice and behaviour that students are reported to influence through clinical placements and as such, determine the overall impact students can have on supervising clinicians. Electronic searches were conducted across MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO and CINAHL in July 2016. Retrieved articles were filtered to find those which presented data relating to students in the clinical setting. Data was extracted and analysed independently by two authors through thematic analysis. Twenty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Results showed that practitioners enjoy the act of teaching. Clinical student presence encourages clinicians to solidify their knowledge base, stimulates learning and causes them to re-evaluate their practice. Practitioner skills were further developed as a results of students. Clinical educator workload and time spent at work increased when a student was present with time management being the predominant challenge practitioners faced. Studies demonstrated that clinicians feel they benefit by students periodically becoming the teacher. Student placements in clinical practice cause an increase in practitioner workload and lengthen their work day. These perceived limitations are outweighed by the many benefits described by supervising clinicians. Providing clinical education can enrich both the practice, and the practitioner, and the aforementioned advantages should be highlighted when offering or considering the expansion of clinical placements. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85023173545"

The Canadian IMG physician pool increasingly includes Canadian-born IMGs (C-IMGs) along with Immigrant-IMGs (I-IMGs). Similar trends exist in the United States. Our objective was to understand the similarities and differences in the challenges faced by both I-IMGs and C-IMGs during residency to identify actionable recommendations to support them during this critical time. We performed a multiple case study of IMGs’ experiences at a large Canadian university. Within our two descriptive cases (I-IMGs, C-IMGs) we iteratively conducted twenty-two semi-structured interviews; we thematically analyzed our data within, between, and across both cases to understand challenges to IMGs’ integration and opportunities for curricular innovations to facilitate their adaptation process. Research team members with different perspectives contributed reflexively to the thematic analysis. Participants identified key differences between medical culture and knowledge expected in Canada and the health systems and curricula in which they originally trained. I-IMG and C-IMG participants perceived two major challenges: discrimination because of negative labelling as IMGs and difficulties navigating their initial residency months. C-IMGs described a third challenge: frustration around the focus on the needs of I-IMGs. Participants from both groups identified two major opportunities: their desire to help other IMGs and a need for mentorship. I-IMGs and C-IMGs face diverse challenges during their training, including disorientation and discrimination. We identified specific objectives to inform the design of curriculum and support services that residency programs can offer trainees as well as important targets for resident education and faculty development. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053938230"

Doing so is not easy for trainees, as they often consider certainty to be a necessary precursor for action and subsequently struggle in these settings. Understanding how skillful clinicians work comfortably when uncertain, therefore, offers an important opportunity to facilitate trainees’ clinical reasoning development. This critical review aims to define and elaborate the concept of ‘comfort with uncertainty’ in clinical settings by juxtaposing a variety of frameworks and theories in ways that generate more deliberate ways of thinking about, and researching, this phenomenon. We used Google Scholar to identify theoretical concepts and findings relevant to the topics of ‘uncertainty,’ ‘ambiguity,’ ‘comfort,’ and ‘confidence,’ and then used preliminary findings to pursue parallel searches within the social cognition, cognition, sociology, sociocultural, philosophy of medicine, and medical education literatures. We treat uncertainty as representing the lived experience of individuals, reflecting the lack of confidence one feels that he/she has an incomplete mental representation of a particular problem. Comfort, in contrast, references confidence in one’s capabilities to act (or not act) in a safe and effective manner given the situation. Clinicians’ ‘comfort with uncertainty’ is informed by a variety of perceptual, emotional, and situational cues, and is enabled through a combination of self-monitoring and forward planning. Potential implications of using ‘comfort with uncertainty’ as a framework for educational and research programs are explored. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056100699"

Research has focused on the scope and effectiveness of such activities and on why individual teachers attend. However, systemic perspectives that go beyond a focus on individual participants are scarce in the existing literature. Employing activity theory, we explored how clinical teachers’ engagement in educational development was affected by the systems they act within. Three focus groups were held with clinical teachers from different professions. A thematic analysis was used to map the contradictions between the systems that the participants were part of and the manifestations of these contradictions in the system of education. In our model, clinical teachers were part of three activity systems directed by the objects of patient care, research and education respectively. Contradictions arose between these systems as their objects were not aligned. This manifested through the enacted values of the academic hospital, difficulties establishing educational discussions in the clinical workplace, the transient nature of educational employments, and impediments to developing a teacher identity. These findings offer insights into the complexities of engaging in educational development as clinical teachers’ priorities interact with the practices and values of the academic hospital, suggesting that attention needs to shift from individual teachers to developing the systems in which they work. © 2018, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054474174"

However, an optimal scoring algorithm for MTF items has not yet been established, as existing studies yielded conflicting results. Therefore, this study analyzes two questions: What is the optimal scoring algorithm for MTF items regarding reliability, difficulty index and item discrimination? How do the psychometric characteristics of different scoring algorithms compare to those of Type A questions used in the same exams? We used data from 37 medical exams conducted in 2015 (998 MTF and 2163 Type A items overall). Using repeated measures analyses of variance (rANOVA), we compared reliability, difficulty and item discrimination of different scoring algorithms for MTF with four answer options and Type A. Scoring algorithms for MTF were dichotomous scoring (DS) and two partial credit scoring algorithms, PS50 where examinees receive half a point if more than half of true/false ratings were marked correctly and one point if all were marked correctly, and PS1/n where examinees receive a quarter of a point for every correct true/false rating. The two partial scoring algorithms showed significantly higher reliabilities (αPS1/n = 0.75; αPS50 = 0.75; αDS = 0.70, αA = 0.72), which corresponds to fewer items needed for a reliability of 0.8 (nPS1/n = 74; nPS50 = 75; nDS = 103, nA = 87), and higher discrimination indices (rPS1/n = 0.33; rPS50 = 0.33; rDS = 0.30; rA = 0.28) than dichotomous scoring and Type A. Items scored with DS tend to be difficult (pDS = 0.50), whereas items scored with PS1/n become easy (pPS1/n = 0.82). PS50 and Type A cover the whole range, from easy to difficult items (pPS50 = 0.66; pA = 0.73). Partial credit scoring leads to better psychometric results than dichotomous scoring. PS50 covers the range from easy to difficult items better than PS1/n.

This is not always done effectively, but we know little about what cues prompt health professionals to call on resources beyond their own knowledge or skill set. Such information would offer guidance regarding how systems might be designed to offer better individual support. In this study, the authors explored the situational factors that are present during moments of uncertainty that lead primary care physicians to access external resources. To do so, a generic qualitative exploratory analysis was conducted on 72 narratives collected through audio recorder-based, self-observational, journaling completed by 12 purposively selected family physicians. Participants were asked to provide a detailed descriptive account of the circumstances surrounding their consultation of external resources immediately after 6 sequential patient encounters in which they felt compelled to seek such support. Thematic analysis of the transcripts was performed to better understand participants’ experiences of the social, contextual, and personal features surrounding decisions to seek support. When doing so we observed that specific features of patient encounters were routinely present when physicians decided to access external sources for help. These included medical aspects of the case (e.g., complex presentations), social aspects (e.g., the presence of another individual), and personal factors (e.g., feeling a need for reassurance). External resources were seen as an opportunity for verification, a mechanism to increase patient satisfaction, and a means through which to defend decision-making. Accessing such resources appeared to influence the physician–patient relationship for various reasons. Recognition and further study of the cues that prompt use of external information will further our understanding of physicians’ behavioural responses to challenging/uncertain situations, highlight mechanisms through which a culture of self-directed assessment seeking might be encouraged, and offer guidance regarding ways in which physicians can be encouraged to practice mindfully. Our results make it clear that reasons for which primary care physicians seek the support of external resources may be multifactorial and, therefore, one should be cautious when inferring reasons for the pursuit of such support. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066877409"

Since that time, patient involvement in HPE has taken on many different meanings. The result is a disparate body of literature that is challenging to search, making it difficult to determine how to continue to build knowledge in the field. To address this problem, we conducted a review of the literature on patient involvement in HPE using a meta-narrative approach. The aim of the review was to synthesize how questions of patient involvement in HPE have been considered across various research traditions and over time. In this paper, we focus on three scholarly communities concerned with various interpretations of patient involvement in HPE—patient as teachers, real patients as standardized patients, and bedside learning. Focus on these three research communities served as a way to draw out various meta-narratives in which patients are thought of in particular ways, specific rationales for involvement are offered, and different research traditions are put to use in the field. Attending to the intersections between these meta-narratives, we focus on the potentially incommensurate ways in which “active” patient engagement is considered within the broader field and the possible implications. We end by reflecting on these tensions and what they might mean for the future of patient involvement, specifically patient involvement as part of future iterations of competency based education. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055264574"

This study therefore aimed to explore what may be required in order for person-centred care programmes to be successful. The study used an ethnographic method of data collection. This consisted of closely following an implementation programme on a medical emergency ward in a Swedish hospital. Data consisted of participant observation and informal interviews with healthcare providers and their management leaders while they were in the process of training to use person-centred care. These interlocutors were using action learning methods under the guidance of facilitators. Our findings revealed that although the programme resulted in some of the processes that are central for person-centred care being developed, organisational factors and a lack of attention to ethics in the programme counteracted these positive effects. The study highlights the importance of facilitating mechanisms to produce desired results. These include management leaders’ learning about the dynamic and collective nature of learning processes and change. They also include allowing for inter-professional dialogue to enable managers and professionals to reflect deeply on professional boundaries, disciplinary knowledge and power relations in their teams. Teamwork is essential for the development of person-centred care and documentation, in accordance with this specific implementation programme, is also indispensable. The space for inter-professional dialogue should also accommodate their various perspectives on the aims of care and organizational reality. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059864527"

It is likely that this has led to increases in tuition driven activities, and thus has limited research activities of academic physical therapy (PT) programs in particular. However, the relationships between sources of program revenue, the number of graduates from PT programs, and the scholarly production of PT faculty have not been studied. The purpose of this paper is to study the effects of types of funding—including research grants and tuition—on the number of physical therapy graduates from each program and the research productivity of physical therapy faculty. Data from 2008 to 2016 were utilized to perform a fixed-effects panel analysis. Panel models created predictions for the number of graduates and the number of peer-reviewed publications for programs from grant funding, annual tuition, and number of funded faculty members. In any given program, a 1% increase in annual tuition is associated with 24% more graduates per year, but a single percentage point increase in the mix of NIH grant funding over other funding types is associated with 8% fewer graduates, all else equal. For every 1% increase in annual tuition, a program can expect to have 41% fewer publications per year. Those institutions with higher numbers of graduates tended to have higher numbers of publications. Higher annual program tuition appears to be associated with both higher numbers of physical therapy graduates and lower levels of publications. Different funding sources have variable effects on degree production and scholarly productivity. Data are self-reported by programs on the Annual Accreditation Report, and cause and effect cannot be established through observational design. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056645874"

This conclusion is supported by numerous studies showing that most distractors (i.e., incorrect answers) are selected by so few examinees that they are essentially nonfunctional. However, nearly all studies have defined a distractor as nonfunctional if it is selected by fewer than 5% of examinees. A limitation of this definition is that the proportion of examinees available to choose a distractor depends on overall item difficulty. This is especially problematic for mastery tests, which consist of items that most examinees are expected to answer correctly. Based on the traditional definition of nonfunctional, a five-option MCQ answered correctly by greater than 90% of examinees will be constrained to have only one functional distractor. The primary purpose of the present study was to evaluate an index of nonfunctional that is sensitive to item difficulty. A secondary purpose was to extend previous research by studying distractor functionality within the context of professionally-developed credentialing tests. Data were analyzed for 840 MCQs consisting of five options per item. Results based on the traditional definition of nonfunctional were consistent with previous research indicating that most MCQs had one or two functional distractors. In contrast, the newly proposed index indicated that nearly half (47.3%) of all items had three or four functional distractors. Implications for item and test development are discussed. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055712784"

First impressions are one such factor. First impressions are judgments about people that are made quickly and are based on little information. Under some circumstances, these judgments can be predictive of subsequent decisions. A concern for both examinees and test administrators is whether the relationship remains stable when the performance of the examinee changes. That is, once a first impression is formed, to what degree will an examiner be willing to modify it? The purpose of this study is to determine the degree that first impressions influence final ratings when the performance of examinees changes within the context of an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Physician examiners (n = 29) viewed seven videos of examinees (i.e., actors) performing a physical exam on a single OSCE station. They rated the examinees’ clinical abilities on a six-point global rating scale after 60 s (first impression or FIGR). They then observed the examinee for the remainder of the station and provided a final global rating (GRS). For three of the videos, the examinees’ performance remained consistent throughout the videos. For two videos, examinee performance changed from initially strong to weak and for two videos, performance changed from initially weak to strong. The mean FIGR rating for the Consistent condition (M = 4.80) and the Strong to Weak condition (M = 4.87) were higher compared to their respective GRS ratings (M = 3.93, M = 2.73) with a greater decline for the Strong to Weak condition. The mean FIGR rating for the Weak to Strong condition was lower (3.60) than the corresponding mean GRS (4.81). This pattern of findings suggests that raters were willing to change their judgments based on examinee performance. Future work should explore the impact of making a first impression judgment explicit versus implicit and the role of context on the relationship between a first impression and a subsequent judgment. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046033400"

Yet consistency in mentoring between senior clinicians and medical students (novice mentoring) which dominate mentoring processes in medical schools is difficult to achieve particularly when mentors practice in both undergraduate and postgraduate medical schools. To facilitate a consistent approach to mentoring this review scrutinizes common aspects of mentoring in undergraduate and postgraduate medical schools to forward a framework for novice mentoring in medical schools. Four authors preformed independent literature searches of novice mentoring guidelines and programmes in undergraduate and postgraduate medical schools using ERIC, PubMed, CINAHL, OVID and Science Direct databases. 25,605 abstracts were retrieved, 162 full-text articles were reviewed and 34 articles were included. The 4 themes were identified—preparation, initiating and supporting the mentoring process and the obstacles to effective mentoring. These themes highlight 2 key elements of an effective mentoring framework-flexibility and structure. Flexibility refers to meeting the individual and changing needs of mentees. Structure concerns ensuring consistency to the mentoring process and compliance with prevailing codes of conduct and standards of practice. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044054315"

Since the gateway to becoming a physician is medical school, diversity must be addressed in the admissions process. The Association of American Medical Colleges has implemented a Holistic Review Initiative aimed at assisting medical schools with broadening admission criteria to include relevant, mission-driven attributes and experiences in addition to academic preparation to identify applicants poised to meet the needs of a diverse patient population. More evidence is needed to determine whether holistic review results in a more diverse selection process. One of the keys to holistic review is to apply holistic principles in all stages of the selection process to ensure qualified applicants are not overlooked. This study examines whether the use of holistic review during application screening at a new medical school increased the diversity of applicants selected for interview. Using retrospective data from the first five application cycles at the Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine (OUWB), the author compared demographic and experiential differences between the applicants selected using holistic review, including experiences, attributes and academic metrics, to a test sample selected solely using academic metrics. The dataset consisted of the total group of applicants selected for interview in 2011 through 2015 using holistic review (n = 2773) and the same number of applicants who would have been selected for an interview using an academic-only selection model (n = 2773), which included 1204 applicants who were selected using both methods (final n = 4342). The author used a combination of cross-tabulation and analysis of variance to identify differences between applicants selected using holistic review and applicants in the test sample selected using only academics. The holistic review process yielded a significantly higher than expected percent of female (adj. resid. = 13.2, p < .01), traditionally underrepresented in medicine (adj. resid. = 15.8, p < .01), first generation (adj. resid. = 5.8, p < .01), and self-identified disadvantaged (adj resid. = 11.5, p < .01) applicants in the interview pool than selected using academic metrics alone. In addition, holistically selected applicants averaged significantly more hours than academically selected students in the areas of pre-medical school paid employment (F = 10.99, mean difference = 657.99, p < .01) and community service (F = 15.36, mean difference = 475.58, p < .01). Using mission-driven, holistic admissions criteria comprised of applicant attributes and experiences in addition to academic metrics resulted in a more diverse interview pool than using academic metrics alone. These findings add support for the use of holistic review in the application screening process as a means for increasing diversity in medical school interview pools. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85039742954"

One factor which may be operating to maintain social exclusion is the language used in representing WA applicants and students by the gatekeepers and representatives of medical schools, Admissions Deans. We therefore examined the institutional discourse of UK Medical Admissions Deans in order to determine how values regarding WA are communicated and presented in this context. We conducted a linguistic analysis of qualitative interviews with Admissions Deans and/or Staff from 24 of 32 UK medical schools. Corpus Linguistics data analysis determined broad patterns of frequency and word lists. This informed a critical discourse analysis of the data using an “othering” lens to explore and understand the judgements made of WA students by Admissions Deans, and the practices to which these judgments give rise. Representations of WA students highlighted existing divides and preconceptions in relation to WA programmes and students. Through using discourse that can be considered othering and divisive, issues of social divide and lack of integration in medicine were highlighted. Language served to reinforce pre-existing stereotypes and a significant ‘us’ and ‘them’ rhetoric exists in medical education. Even with drivers to achieve diversity and equality in medical education, existing social structures and preconceptions still influence the representations of applicants and students from outside the ‘traditional’ medical education model in the UK. Acknowledging this is a crucial step for medical schools wishing to address barriers to the perceived challenges to diversity. © 2018, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040914605"

After developing a program where all 1st-year medical students are integrated into interprofessional care teams to contribute to patient care, authors use a diffusion of innovations framework to explore and identify barriers, facilitators, and best practices for implementing value-added clinical systems learning roles. In 2016, authors conducted 32 clinical-site observations, 29 1:1 interviews with mentors, and four student focus-group interviews. Data were transcribed verbatim, and a thematic analysis was used to identify themes. Authors discussed drafts of the categorization scheme, and agreed upon results and quotations. Of 36 sites implementing the program, 17 (47%) remained, 8 (22%) significantly modified, and 11 (31%) withdrew from the program. Identified strategies for implementing value-added roles included: student education, patient characteristics, patient selection methods, activities performed, and resources. Six themes influencing program implementation and maintenance included: (1) educational benefit, (2) value added to patient care from student work, (3) mentor time and site capacity, (4) student engagement, (5) working relationship between school, site, and students, and, (6) students’ continuity at the site. Health systems science is an emerging focus for medical schools, and educators are challenged to design practice-based roles that enhance education and add value to patient care. Health professions’ schools implementing value-added roles will need to invest resources and strategize about best-practice strategies to guide efforts. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044211290"

We conducted a linguistic analysis, called Membership Categorization Analysis, of interviews with leaders of recent curriculum changes to explore how they talk about educational scientists in relation to these processes. The analysis was conducted on previously collected interview data with nine change leaders of major undergraduate medical curriculum change processes in the Netherlands. We analyzed how change leaders categorize HPESUs and educational scientists (use of category terms) and what they say about them (predicates). We noticed two ways of categorizing educational scientists, with observable different predicates. Educational scientists categorized by their first name were suggested to be closer to the change process, more involved in decisional practices and positively described, whereas those described in more generic terms were represented in terms of relatively passive and unspecified activities, were less explicit referenced for their knowledge and expertise and were predominantly factually or negatively described. This study shows an ambiguous portrayal of educational scientists by leaders of major curriculum change processes. Medical schools are challenged to establish medical curricula in consultation with a large, diverse and interdisciplinary stakeholder group. We suggest that it is important to invest in interpersonal relationships to strengthen the internal collaborations and make sure people are aware of each other’s existence and roles in the process of curriculum development. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065675542"

Academics use an array of techniques, methods and conceptual apparatuses to achieve this goal. The question we explore in this essay is the following: Does the grounded theory approach, in the constructivist version developed by Kathy Charmaz, provide the necessary methodological tools for the creation of knowledge and theories beyond everyday thinking? To conduct our analysis, we have drawn on the rationalist epistemology originally developed by Gaston Bachelard and taken up a few decades later by Pierre Bourdieu and colleagues to look at the epistemological foundation of the CGT methods as defined by Charmaz. We focussed on two distinctive epistemological features characterising constructivist grounded theory (CGT): the use of inductive reasoning to generate interpretative theory; and the primacy of subjectivity over objectivity as the preferred path to knowledge making. While the usefulness of CGT for conducting qualitative research and understanding the perspective of social actors has been acknowledged by scholars in health professions education research and other research areas, the inductivist logic on which it draws raises questions concerning the nature of the knowledge yielded by this approach. As we argue in this article, it is still unclear in what way the interpretative theory generated by CGT is not a duplication of everyday thinking expressed through meta-narratives. It is also unclear how the understanding of social phenomena can be refined if the use of inductive procedures logically implies the creation of a new theory each time a study is conducted. We engage with these questions to broaden the epistemological conversation within the health professions education research community. It is our hope that scholars in the field will engage in this epistemological conversation and advance it in new directions. © 2018, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051676700"

The objective of the study is to explore how direct observation was experienced by residents and faculty in the context of the I-PASS Handoff Study. In this multi-center qualitative study, we conducted focus groups and semi-structured interviews of residents and faculty members at eight tertiary pediatric centers in North America that implemented the I-PASS Handoff Bundle. We employed qualitative thematic analysis to interpret the data. Barriers to and strategies for direct observation were described relating to the observer, trainee, and clinical environment. Residents and faculty described a mutual awareness that residents change their performance of handoffs when observed, in contrast to their usual behavior in a clinical setting. Changes in handoff performance may depend on the nature of the observer or ‘audience’. Direct observation also highlighted the importance of handoffs to participants, recognized as a clinical activity that warrants feedback and assessment. Dramaturgical theory can be used to understand our finding of ‘front-stage’ (observed) versus ‘backstage’ (unobserved) handoffs as distinct performances, tailored to an “audience”. Educators must be cognizant of changes in performance of routine clinical activities when using direct observation to assess clinical competence. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058363799"

Therefore, continuing education (CE) and continuing professional development (CPD) are needed to secure safe and good quality healthcare. The aim of the study was to investigate the hypothesized associations and their directions between pharmacists’ basic psychological needs in CE, their academic motivation, well-being, learning outcomes. Self-determination theory was used as a theoretical framework for this study. Data were collected through four questionnaires measuring: academic motivation, basic psychological needs (BPN), vitality and lifelong learning adaptability of pharmacists in the CE/CPD learning context. Structural equation modelling was used to analyze the data. Demographic factors like gender and working environment influenced the observed scores for frustration of BPN and factors like training status and working experience influenced the observed scores for academic motivation. A good model fit could be found only for a part of the hypothesized pathway. Frustration of BPN is positively directly related to the less desirable type of academic motivation, controlled motivation (0.88) and negatively directly related to vitality (− 1.61) and negatively indirectly related to learning outcomes in CE. Fulfillment or frustration of BPN are important predictors for well-being and learning outcomes. Further research should be conducted to discover how we can prevent these needs from being frustrated in order to design a motivating, vitalizing and sustainable CE/CPD system for pharmacists and other healthcare professionals.

However, we have a limited understanding of how assessors make judgements and formulate ratings in real world contexts. The current research on assessor cognition has largely focused on the cognitive domain but the contextual factors are equally important, and both are closely interconnected. This study aimed to explore the perceived cognitive and contextual factors influencing Mini-CEX assessor judgements in the Emergency Department setting. We used a conceptual framework of assessor-based judgement to develop a sequential mixed methods study. We analysed and integrated survey and focus group results to illustrate self-reported cognitive and contextual factors influencing assessor judgements. We used situated cognition theory as a sensitizing lens to explore the interactions between people and their environment. The major factors highlighted through our mixed methods study were: clarity of the assessment, reliance on and variable approach to overall impression (gestalt), role tension especially when giving constructive feedback, prior knowledge of the trainee and case complexity. We identified prevailing tensions between participants (assessors and trainees), interactions (assessment and feedback) and setting. The two practical implications of our research are the need to broaden assessor training to incorporate both cognitive and contextual domains, and the need to develop a more holistic understanding of assessor-based judgements in real world contexts to better inform future research and development in workplace-based assessments. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055052983"

Studies demonstrate that productive failure prepares students for later learning of new, related knowledge. Our study explored the effectiveness of productive failure as an instructional intervention in health professions education with respect to (a) acquisition and application of a novel concept, and (b) learners’ preparation for future learning of new, related content. Forty year-one students enrolled in the Doctor of Pharmacy program at the University of Toronto were randomly assigned to a productive failure (i.e. attempt to generate solutions before receiving instruction) or direct instruction only learning condition. After a practice phase, participants completed a series of tests designed to measure knowledge acquisition, knowledge application, and preparation for future learning (new learning is required for successful problem solving). As expected, no difference in performance was seen between participants on the acquisition and application tests. However, participants in the productive failure condition outperformed those in the direct instruction condition on the preparation for future learning test. These results emphasize the role of struggle in learning and support the theory that engaging students in solving problems that are beyond their abilities can be a productive exercise in failure. The results suggest that productive failure assists learners in acquiring the conceptual knowledge needed to facilitate learning in the future. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065980379"

Educators play a central role in supporting students when evaluating a student's concerns and in deciding whether support and/or sanction should be offered. It is not known how educators approach or resolve such potentially contradictory responses. We conducted an interview study of 21 medical educators from a range of professional backgrounds across 11 on-campus and clinical teaching sites. Using Positioning Theory to inform our thematic analysis, we found that participants adopted an overarching position of Diagnostician, and at times, two alternative positions, the Judge and the Confidant when supporting students. In their narratives of support encounters, individual students were positioned as Good Students or Troubling Students. For most, educator positions were fluid and responsive to the storylines enacted in encounters. Rigidly adopting Judge or Confidant positions could lead to “failure to fail” and violations of professional boundaries. Positioning Theory locates student support in a moral space and helps explain the consternation experienced by educators when support is not effective. Positioning analysis offers a language, and metaphors which are meaningful to educators, for framing discussion and reviews of support practices and progression decisions. Such insights could encourage reflective practice and guide further research to inform practice when students with troubling concerns and persistently borderline performances require support. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064849177"

In the current study we explored gender differences in clinical position among academic physicians at three university hospitals, each in a different European country. These countries, Sweden, the Netherlands and Austria, differ in terms of gender equality. We analyzed whether the number of children, working hours or publications could explain gender differences in physicians’ clinical position. In this cross-sectional questionnaire study 1333 (54% female) physicians participated. Physicians were asked about their gender, age, number of children, working hours and clinical position. We used structural equation models to explore the influence of gender on the physicians’ clinical position in each of the three countries. We explored whether the association between gender and clinical position could be explained by number of children, working hours or publication activity. The analyses revealed that at all three university hospitals gender influenced clinical position. These gender differences in clinical position could be partly explained by gender differences in publication activity. Female physicians as compared to male physicians were likely to publish fewer articles, and in turn these lower publication numbers were associated with lower clinical positions. The number of children or working hours did not explain gender differences in publication activity or clinical position. Therefore, factors other than unequal allocation of household labor, such as the academic working environment, may still disproportionately disadvantage women’s progress, even at universities in countries with high rates of gender equality such as Sweden. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062778670"

Only 10% of medical schools offer videoconference interviews to applicants and little is known about the impact of this interview modality on the admissions process. This study investigated the impact of overall acceptance rates using videoconference interviews and face-to-face interviews in the medical school selection process using an equivalence trial design. The University of New Mexico School of Medicine integrated a videoconferencing interview option for community and rural physician interviewers in a pseudo-random fashion during the 2014–2016 admissions cycles. Logistic regression was conducted to examine whether videoconference interviews impacted acceptance rates or the characteristics of accepted students. Demographic, admissions and diversity factors were analyzed that included applicant age, MCAT score, cumulative GPA, gender, underrepresented in medicine, socioeconomic status and geographic residency. Data from 752 interviews were analyzed. Adjusted rates of acceptance for face-to-face (37.0%; 95% CI 28.2, 46.7%) and videoconference (36.1%; 95% CI 17.8, 59.5%) interviews were within an a priori ± 5% margin of equivalence. Both interview conditions yielded highly diverse groups of admitted students. Having a higher medical college admission test score, grade point average, and self-identifying as disadvantaged increased odds of admission in both interview modalities. Integration of the videoconference interview did not impact the overall acceptance of a highly diverse and qualified group of applicants, and allowed rural and community physicians to participate in the medical school interview process as well as allowed campus faculty and medical student committee members to interview remotely. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042113055"

Those who chose to reapply (n = 665) were compared to those who did not reapply (n = 3342).

Our study focuses on students’ life stories to comprehensively identify factors contributing to student wellbeing. We performed a secondary analysis of life-story interviews with graduating fourth year medical students. These interviews were originally conducted in 2012 as part of the Project on the Good Physician, and then re-analyzed, focusing on student wellbeing. Respondents were encouraged to identify turning points in their life stories. De-identified transcripts were then coded using a consensus-based iterative process. 17 of 21 respondents reported feeling burned out at least once during medical school. Students identified three major stressors: negative role models, difficult rotations, and the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1. Two “motivational stressors”—financial concerns and personal life events—emerged as sources of stress that also motivated students to persevere. Finally, students identified four factors—positive role models, support networks, faith and spirituality, and passion—that helped them reframe stressors, making the struggle seem more worthwhile. These findings suggest that a life-story approach can add granularity to current understandings of medical student wellbeing. Initiatives to reduce stress and burnout should extend beyond the immediate medical school context and consider how past challenges might become future sources of resilience. This study also provides an example of secondary analysis of qualitative data, an approach which could be useful to future research in medical education. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046452577"

Workplace learning theories highlight how individual agency and workplace structures dynamically interact to produce change within individuals and learning environments. Promoting awareness of individual biases shaped by clinical learning environments may therefore represent a unique type of workplace learning. We sought to explore how individuals and the workplace learning environment interact once awareness of implicit biases are triggered within learners. In accordance with longitudinal case study methodology and informed by constructivist grounded theory, we conducted multiple longitudinal interviews with physician and nurse participants over 12 months. Our results suggest that implicit bias recognition provokes dissonance among participants leading to frustration, and critical questioning of workplace constraints. Once awareness is triggered, participants began reflecting on their biases and engaging in explicit behavioural changes that influenced the perception of structural changes within the learning environment itself. Collaboration, communication and role modeling within teams appeared to facilitate the process as individual and workplace affordances were gradually transformed. Our findings suggest a potential model for understanding how individual learners adaptively reinvent their role in response to disruptions in their learning environment. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042116561"

A web-based survey was administered at the beginning of the 2017–2018 academic year which included the JSE, a scale to detect “good impression” responses, and demographic/background information. Usable surveys were received from 6009 students enrolled in 41 college campuses (median response rate = 92%). The JSE mean score and standard deviation for the sample were 116.54 and 10.85, respectively. Item-total score correlations were positive and statistically significant (p < 0.01), and Cronbach α = 0.82. Significant gender differences were observed on the JSE scores in favor of women. Also, significant differences were found on item scores between top and bottom third scorers on the JSE. Three factors of Perspective Taking, Compassionate Care, and Walking in Patient’s Shoes emerged in an exploratory factor analysis by using half of the sample. Results of confirmatory factor analysis with another half of the sample confirmed the 3-factor model. We also developed a national norm table which is the first to assess students’ JSE scores against national data. © 2018, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049580315"

Evidence is also accumulating that retrieval practice can enhance other cognitive processes such as the ability to critically evaluate research articles (Dobson et al. in Med Educ 52(5):513–525, 2018) and transfer of learning (Butler in J Exp Psychol Learn Mem Cogn 36(5):1118, 2010). One aim of this investigation was to explore the effects of retrieval practice on transfer of learning with physiology information. A second aim was to compare recall and transfer of physiology information following retrieval practice versus a judgment of learning task (JOL) that is potentially less time consuming for students to use. Participants were randomly assigned to learn three physiology texts using each of the following strategies: (1) studying a text four times (S–S–S–S), (2) studying and then retrieving a text two times (S–R–S–R), and (3) studying a text four times while completing multiple JOL during the second and fourth repetitions (S–S/J–S–S/J). Recall and accuracy on transfer questions were assessed 1 week after the learning phase, and the results were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVAs. The S–R–S–R strategy (21.35 ± 1.08%) produced significantly greater recall than the S–S–S–S strategy (17.35 ± 0.86%), and both the S–R–S–R (44.60 ± 2.55%) and S–S/J–S–S/J (41.79 ± 2.63%) strategies lead to significantly greater transfer than the S–S–S–S strategy (36.07 ± 2.40%). These results provide evidence that retrieval practice enhances recall and transfer of physiology information and that a JOL task can also prove to be beneficial but to a lesser degree. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062563949"

We investigated the associations of learning climate with residents’ work-related well-being. A multicenter questionnaire study was performed among 271 surgery and gynaecology residents in 21 training programs from September 2012 to February 2013. Residents were asked to complete work-related well-being measurements: work engagement (Utrecht Work Engagement Scale), job and specialty satisfaction (measures from Physician Worklife Study), and physician empathy (Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy). The Dutch Residency Educational Climate Test was used to evaluate learning climate. Multivariate adjusted linear regression analyses were used to estimate associations of learning climate with work-related well-being measures. Well-being measures were completed by 144 residents (53.1%). Learning climate was evaluated by 193 residents, yielding 9.2 evaluations per training program on average. Overall learning climate score was positively associated with work engagement [regression coefficient b = 0.58; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18–0.98; p = 0.004] and job satisfaction (b = 0.80; 95% CI 0.48–1.13; p < 0.001). No associations were found between learning climate and empathy and specialty satisfaction. Residents’ work engagement and job satisfaction are positively related to the learning climate and may be further enhanced by improved learning climates of training programs. © 2018, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057950716"

However, much work still remains to progress beyond such good intentions. Moving from contemplation to action means embracing social accountability as a key guiding principle for change. Social accountability means that health institutions attend to improving the performance of individual practitioners and health systems by directing educational and practice interventions to promote the health of all the public and assessing the systemic effects of these interventions. In this Reflection, the authors (1) review the reasons why health professional schools and their governing bodies should codify, in both curricular and accreditation standards, norms of excellence in social accountability, (2) present four considerations crucial to successfully implementing this codification, and (3) discuss the challenges such changes might entail. The authors conclude by noting that in adopting socially accountable criteria, schools will need to expand their philosophical scope to recognize social accountability as a vitally important part of their institutional professional identity. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029177203"

If unprofessional behaviour is identified, educators can help the student to improve their professional performance. In an earlier study, based on opinions of frontline teachers from one institution, the authors identified three profiles of medical students’ unprofessional behaviour: (1) Poor reliability, (2) Poor reliability and poor insight, and (3) Poor reliability, poor insight and poor adaptability. The distinguishing variable was Capacity for self-reflection and adaptability. The current study used Nominal Group Technique and thematic analysis to refine these findings by synthesizing experts’ opinions from different medical schools, aiming to develop a model of unprofessional behaviour profiles in medical students. Thirty-one experienced faculty, purposively sampled for knowledge and experience in teaching and evaluation of professionalism, participated in five meetings at five medical schools in the Netherlands. In each group, participants generated ideas, discussed them, and independently ranked these ideas by allocating points to them. Experts suggested ten different ideas, from which the top 3 received 60% of all ranking points: (1) Reflectiveness and adaptability are two distinct distinguishing variables (25%), (2) The term reliability is too narrow to describe unprofessional behaviour (22%), and (3) Profiles are dynamic over time (12%). Incorporating these ideas yielded a model consisting of four profiles of medical students’ unprofessional behaviour (accidental behaviour, struggling behaviour, gaming-the-system behaviour and disavowing behaviour) and two distinguishing variables (reflectiveness and adaptability). The findings could advance educators’ insight into students’ unprofessional behaviour, and provide information for future research on professionalism remediation. © 2018, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055976445"

During the first year in a new professional practice, a new RN experiences a transition during which the new professional identity is being formed. This is a challenging and demanding period of time. According to the learning theory of communities of practice by Lave and Wenger, individuals’ learning and development in a new professional practice occurs through participation in social activity and is influenced by context. This study is based on the qualitative data from semi-structured interviews. Thirty-two RNs working in the Swedish emergency medical service were interviewed via telephone during the spring of 2017. A qualitative content analysis with deductive reasoning of the interviews was used. The analysis process generated the main category; New RNs participation is challenged by unpredictability and uncertainty in practice. The main category was based on three generic categories; Loneliness in an unpredictable context, Uncertainty about the team, and Uncertainty in action. The challenges new RNs encounter during the first year relate to all three dimensions of a community of practice; mutual engagement, joint enterprise and shared repertoire. The encountered challenges also relate to the EMS context. Taking into account all these aspects when designing support models for RN’s professional development may be advantageous for creating positive development for RNs new to the EMS and/or similar practices. © 2018, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056707108"

However, it remains unclear what factors render this participation in institutional governance a success or a failure. Another question is: what are the perceived benefits for schools and students? We empirically explored experiences and perspectives of student representatives and program directors of all (8) medical and (1) veterinary schools in the Netherlands on factors that influence student participation in institutional governance and its values and challenges for schools and student representatives. A constructivist grounded theory study was performed. A theoretical sample of student representatives was invited to fill out an explorative, qualitative questionnaire. Next, focus groups with student representatives and interviews with all program directors were conducted. Data was analyzed using open, axial and selective coding by all authors. Experiences and perspectives of students and program directors were remarkably similar in both perceived influences and values. Four main categories of influences could be distinguished in student participation: (1) individual student characteristics, (2) individual staff characteristics, (3) the organization of student representatives and (4) the school’s organization, including its culture and policy regarding student participation. A cohesive, well-organized and independent student organization has crucial impact on student participation in educational governance processes. For representatives, major benefits of participation are personal and career development. Challenges are low effectiveness and efficiency of their actions. A clear school policy on student participation and better introduction, feedback and coaching of representatives should be provided to improve student participation in governance processes. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065237113"

Although literature on feedback in medical education is abundant, many supervisors struggle with providing this feedback and residents experience feedback as insufficiently constructive. With a detailed analysis of real-world feedback conversations, this study aims to contribute to the current literature by deepening the understanding of how feedback on residents’ performance is provided, and to formulate recommendations for improvement of feedback practice. Eight evaluation meetings between program directors and residents were recorded in 2015–2016. These meetings were analyzed using conversation analysis. This is an ethno-methodological approach that uses a data-driven, iterative procedure to uncover interactional patterns that structure naturally occurring, spoken interaction. Feedback in our data took two forms: feedback as a unidirectional activity and feedback as a dialogic activity. The unidirectional feedback activities prevailed over the dialogic activities. The two different formats elicit different types of resident responses and have different implications for the progress of the interaction. Both feedback formats concerned positive as well as negative feedback and both were often mitigated by the participants. Unidirectional feedback and mitigating or downplaying feedback is at odds with the aim of feedback in medical education. Dialogic feedback avoids the pitfall of a program director-dominated conversation and gives residents the opportunity to take ownership of their strengths and weaknesses, which increases chances to change resident behavior. On the basis of linguistic analysis of our real-life data we suggest implications for feedback conversations. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064209233"

Literature and research regarding the OSCE is most often situated within the psychometric or competency discourses of assessment. This paper describes an alternative approach: Actor-network-theory (ANT), a sociomaterial approach to understanding practice and learning. ANT provides a means to productively examine tensions and limitations of the OSCE, in part through extending research to include social relationships and physical objects. Using a narrative example, the paper suggests three ANT-informed insights into the OSCE. We describe: (1) exploring the OSCE as a holistic combination of people and objects; (2) thinking about the influences a checklist can exert over the OSCE; and (3) the implications of ANT educational research for standardisation within the OSCE. We draw from this discussion to provide a practical agenda for ANT research into the OSCE. This agenda promotes new areas for exploration in an often taken-for-granted assessment format. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031419973"

Although some articles have explored how residents engage with supervisors, nurses and pharmacists individually, there is little research on how residents enter into and engage with the broader community of clinical practice (CoCP). To this end, we designed a constructivist grounded theory study that took place at Universidad Javeriana in Bogotá, Colombia. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 residents from different training levels and disciplines during the first weeks of their new rotations. During the interviews, we used the Pictor technique as a visual aid to collect data. Using iterative data collection and analysis, constant comparison methods and theoretical sampling, we constructed the final results. When entering a CoCP, residents experienced recurring and intertwined processes including: exploring how their goals and interest are aligned with those of the CoCP; identifying the relevant CoCP members in the workplace environment; and understanding how these members could assist their successful engagement with the community’s practices. Residents entered a CoCP with the intention of either having a central or a peripheral trajectory in it. The final resident participation and role resulted from negotiations between the resident and the CoCP members. Optimising workplace learning includes being mindful as to how each member of the healthcare team influence residents’ engagement on practice, and on understanding the nuances of residents’ participatory trajectories while interacting with them. Understanding such nuances could be key to align CoCPs’ learning affordances and residents’ goals and intentions. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060255436"

Many medical schools have implemented prematriculation programs to prepare students from diverse backgrounds; however, evidence on their impact is largely lacking. In this study, we analyzed participants’ demographics as well as the impact of the prematriculation program on Year 1 performance. Predictive validity of the program was assessed and compared to other traditional predictors, including grade point average (GPA) and Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores and subscores. Linear mixed effect models determined the impact of the prematriculation program, and linear regression analysis assessed the predictive value of the overall score in the prematriculation program and other traditional predictors. Demographics of students participating in the prematriculation program from 2013 to 2015 (n = 75) revealed a significantly higher prevalence of academically disadvantaged students including older students, students with lower GPA and MCAT scores and students of racial and ethnic populations that are underrepresented in medicine, compared to non-participants (n = 293). Participants performed significantly better in Year 1 courses that were covered in the prematriculation program compared to courses that were not covered. The overall performance in the prematriculation program correlated significantly with Year 1 performance and was found to be a strong predictor for Year 1 performance. This study suggests that a prematriculation program can help students to succeed in the first year of medical school. The results have implications for medical schools seeking to implement or evaluate the effectiveness of their prematriculation program. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040578984"

They are particularly suited to medical education as these approaches pool findings from original qualitative studies, whilst paying attention to context and theoretical development. Although increasingly sophisticated use is being made of qualitative primary research methodologies in health professions education (HPE) the use of secondary qualitative reviews in HPE remains underdeveloped. This study examined QES methods applied to clinical humanism in healthcare as a way of advancing thinking around the use of QES in HPE in general. A systematic search strategy identified 49 reviews that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Meta-study was used to develop an analytic summary of methodological characteristics, the role of theory, and the synthetic processes used in QES reviews. Fifteen reviews used a defined methodology, and 17 clearly explained the processes that led from data extraction to synthesis. Eight reviews adopted a specific theoretical perspective. Authors rarely described their reflexive relationship with their data. Epistemological positions tended to be implied rather than explicit. Twenty-five reviews included some form of quality appraisal, although it was often unclear how authors acted on its results. Reviewers under-reported qualitative approaches in their review methodologies, and tended to focus on elements such as systematicity and checklist quality appraisal that were more germane to quantitative evidence synthesis. A core concern was that the axiological (value) dimensions of the source materials were rarely considered let alone accommodated in the synthesis techniques used. QES can be used in HPE research but only with careful attention to maintaining axiological integrity. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046900839"

As high level policy developments, the changes were intended to improve outcomes by supporting learning and skills development. However, we argue that previous experiences with major innovations in assessment offer an important road map for developing and refining assessment innovations, including careful piloting and analyses of their measurement qualities and impacts. Based on the literature, numerous assessment workshops, personal interactions with potential users, and our 40 years of experience in implementing assessment change, we lament the lack of a coordinated approach to clarify and improve measurement qualities and functionality of competency based assessment (CBA). To address this worrisome situation, we offer two roadmaps to guide CBA’s further development. Initially, reframe and address CBA as a measurement development opportunity. Secondly, using a roadmap adapted from the management literature on sustainable innovation, the medical assessment community needs to initiate an integrated plan to implement CBA as a sustainable innovation within existing educational programs and self-regulatory enterprises. Further examples of down-stream opportunities to refocus CBA at the implementation level within faculties and within the regulatory framework of the profession are offered. In closing, we challenge the broader assessment community in medicine to step forward and own the challenge and opportunities to reframe CBA as an innovation to improve the quality of the clinical educational experience. The goal is to optimize assessment in health education and ultimately improve the public’s health. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047161479"

In this first Australian study of its kind, we use consequential validity as a theoretical lens to examine how medical school students and applicants view and experience the Graduate Medical Schools Admission Test (GAMSAT), and the consequences of testing. Participants (n = 447) were recruited from five graduate-entry medical schools across Australia and a publicly available online test preparation forum. An online survey was used to gather demographic information, and quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative data were analysed via descriptive statistics and qualitative data were thematically analysed. The findings showed there was a considerable financial burden associated with preparing for and sitting the GAMSAT and moderate agreement regarding the GAMSAT as a fair selection method. The main unintended consequences of using the GAMSAT as a selection tool included barriers related to test affordability and language, and socialisation into the hidden curriculum of medicine. Selection tools such as the GAMSAT have some limitations when the goals are to support equitable participation in medicine and professional identity development.

This study aimed to understand what constitutes status and prestige in the medical field and how it influences medical doctors’ choice of specialty. By using a sociological perspective and applying Bourdieu’s theoretical concepts of field, symbolic capital and perceived status, we analysed young doctors’ journeys towards their chosen specialty. We conducted 15 in-depth semi-structured interviews. The data was analysed using content analysis. The findings suggest that medical specialties carry different social status. In the field of power, surgery is seen as the most prestigious of all specialties. However, in the future it might be a less attractive choice when young doctors tend to view their profession less as an identity and more like a job. For specialties perceived as low status, the challenge is to raise popularity by better describing to young doctors the characteristics and advantages of these specialties. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060215178"

However, a recent editorial entitled “Is Psychometrics Science?” highlighted some core epistemological and practical problems in psychometrics, and brought its legitimacy into question. This paper attempts to address these issues by applying some key ideas from history and philosophy of science (HPS) discourse. I present some of the conceptual developments in HPS that have bearing on the psychometrics debate. Next, by shifting the focus onto what constitutes the practice of science, I discuss psychometrics in action. Some incorrectly conceptualize science as an assemblage of truths, rather than an assemblage of tools and goals. Psychometrics, however, seems to be an assemblage of methods and techniques. Psychometrics in action represents a range of practices using specific tools in specific contexts. This does not render the practice of psychometrics meaningless or futile. Engaging in debates about whether or not we should regard psychometrics as ‘scientific’ is, however, a fruitless enterprise. The key question and focus should be whether, on what grounds, and in what contexts, the existing methods and techniques used by psychometricians can be justified or criticized. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026905642"

The majority of literature devoted to this topic has focused upon a perceived gap between clinical and non-clinical skills and interventions taken to address it. Building upon recent streams of scholarship in identity formation and adaptation to new contexts, this work uses a Heideggerian perspective to frame an autoethnographical exploration of the author’s transition into independent paediatric practice. An archive of reflective journal entries and personal communications was assembled from the author’s first 3 years of practice in four different contexts and analyzed using Heidegger’s linked existentials of understanding, attunement and discourse. Insights from his journey suggest this period is a time of anxiety and vulnerability when one questions one’s competence and very identity as a medical professional. At the same time, it illustrates the inseparable link between practitioners and the network of relationships in which they are bound, how these relationships contextually vary and how recognizing and tuning to these differences may allow for a more seamless transition. While this work is the experience of one person, its insights support the ideas that change is a constant in professional practice and competence is contextual. As a result, developing educational content that inculcates contextual flexibility and an increased comfort level with uncertainty may prepare our trainees not just to navigate the unavoidable novelty of transition, but lay the groundwork for professional identities attuned to engage more broadly with change itself. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041899917"

However, the hospital learning environment has two main limitations. First, most inpatients require acute care, and students may complete their training without seeing patients with frequent non-emergent and chronic diseases that are managed in outpatient settings. Second, students rarely cope with diagnostic problems, because most inpatients are diagnosed in the community or the emergency room. These limitations have led some medical schools to offer longitudinal integrated clerkships in community settings instead of hospital block clerkship rotations. In this paper, I propose the hypothesis that the hospital learning environment has a third limitation: it causes students’ distress and delays their development of reflectivity and medical professionalism. This hypothesis is supported by evidence that (a) the clinical learning environment, rather than students’ personality traits, is the major driver of students’ distress, and (b) the development of attributes, such as moral reasoning, empathy, emotional intelligence and tolerance of uncertainty that are included in the definitions of both reflectivity and medical professionalism, is arrested during undergraduate medical training. Future research may test the proposed hypothesis by comparing students’ development of these attributes during clerkships in hospital wards with that during longitudinal clerkships in community settings. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042446808"

Therefore, attempts are being made to strengthen the integration of research into teaching from the first year onwards. First-year students may interpret attempts made to strengthen research integration differently than intended by teachers. This might be explained by student beliefs about learning and research as well as student perceptions of the learning environment. In general, student perceptions of the learning environment play a pivotal role in fostering student learning outcomes. This study aims to determine whether a curriculum change intended to promote research integration fosters student learning outcomes and student perceptions of research integrated into teaching. To serve this purpose, three subsequent cohorts of first-year students were compared, one before and two after a curriculum change. Learning outcomes of these students were measured using scores on a national progress test of 921 students and assessments of a sample of 100 research reports of a first-year student research project. 746 Students filled out the Student Perceptions of Research Integration Questionnaire. The findings suggest that learning outcomes of these students, that is, scores on research related test items of the progress test and the quality of research reports, were better than those of students before the curriculum change. © 2017, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033452291"

Besides two-dimensional (2D) images, current imaging technologies allow for volumetric display of medical images. Whereas current radiology practice increasingly uses volumetric images, the majority of studies on medical image interpretation is conducted on 2D images. The current study aimed to gain deeper insight into the volumetric image interpretation process by examining this process in twenty radiology trainees who all completed four volumetric image cases. Two types of data were obtained concerning scroll behaviors and think-aloud data. Types of scroll behavior concerned oscillations, half runs, full runs, image manipulations, and interruptions. Think-aloud data were coded by a framework of knowledge and skills in radiology including three cognitive processes: perception, analysis, and synthesis. Relating scroll behavior to cognitive processes showed that oscillations and half runs coincided more often with analysis and synthesis than full runs, whereas full runs coincided more often with perception than oscillations and half runs. Interruptions were characterized by synthesis and image manipulations by perception. In addition, we investigated relations between cognitive processes and found an overall bottom-up way of reasoning with dynamic interactions between cognitive processes, especially between perception and analysis. In sum, our results highlight the dynamic interactions between these processes and the grounding of cognitive processes in scroll behavior. It suggests, that the types of scroll behavior are relevant to describe how radiologists interact with and manipulate volumetric images. © 2018, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047115390"

This study explored the metacognitive judgments of 157 first-year medical students; in particular, the study examined students’ self-assessments or calibration as they engaged in a virtual-patient simulation targeting clinical reasoning practices. Examining two key subtasks of a patient encounter, history (Hx) and physical exam (PE), the authors assessed the level of variation in students’ behavioral performance (i.e., effectiveness and efficiency) and judgments of performance (i.e., calibration bias and accuracy) across the two subtasks. Paired t tests revealed that the Hx subtask was deemed to be more challenging than the PE subtask when viewed in terms of both actual and perceived performance. In addition to students performing worse on the Hx subtask than PE, they also perceived that they performed less well for Hx. Interestingly, across both subtasks, the majority of participants overestimated their performance (98% of participants for Hx and 95% for PE). Correlation analyses revealed that the participants’ overall level of accuracy in metacognitive judgments was moderately stable across the Hx and PE subtasks. Taken together, findings underscore the importance of assessing medical students’ metacognitive judgments at different points during a clinical encounter. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066043833"

One must be cautious to use this phenomenon strategically, however, due to uncertainty about whether testing improves memorability for only tested material, facilitates learning of related non-tested content, or inhibits memory of non-tested material. 52 second-year Pharmacy students were asked to study therapeutic aspects of gastroesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcer disease. One group was given 30 min to study. Another was given 20 min to study and 10 min to complete a 10-item test. Two weeks later a 40-item test was delivered to both groups that contained (a) the 10 learning phase questions, (b) 10 new questions drawn from the studied material, (c) 10 new questions about therapeutics in different disease states, and (d) 10 new questions drawn from more general pharmaceutical knowledge (e.g., basic physiology and drug characteristics). Moderate to large retrieval-enhanced learning effects were observed for both questions about material that was tested (22.9% difference in scores, p < 0.05, d = 0.60) and questions about material that was studied without being tested (18.9% difference, p < 0.05, d = 0.75). Such effects were not observed for questions that were not part of the study material: therapeutic questions that addressed different disease states (1.8% difference, p > 0.7, d = 0.08) or generic pharmaceutical questions (7.4% difference, p > 0.2, d = 0.32). Being tested made it more likely that students would report reviewing the material after the initial learning session, but such reports were not associated with better test performance. The benefit of mentally retrieving information from studied material appears to facilitate the retrieval of information that was studied without being tested. Such generalization of the benefit of testing can increase the flexibility of test-based pedagogic interventions. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047402768"

Proper guidance of the visual problem solving of apprentices by the master is necessary. Interaction and adaptation to the expertise level of the learner are identified as key ingredients of this guidance. This study focuses on the effect of increased participation of the learner in the task on the interaction and adaptation of the guidance by masters. Thirteen unique dyads consisting of a clinical pathologist (master) and a resident (apprentice) discussed and diagnosed six microscope images. Their dialogues were analysed on their content. The dyads were divided in two groups according to the experience of the apprentice. For each dyad, master and apprentice both operated the microscope for half of the cases. Interaction was operationalised as the equal contribution of both master and apprentice to the dialogue. Adaptation was operationalised as the extent to which the content of the dialogues was adapted to the apprentice’s level. The main hypothesis stated that the interaction and adaptation increase when apprentices operate the microscope. Most results confirmed this hypothesis: apprentices contributed more content when participating more and the content of these dialogues better reflected expertise differences of apprentices. Based on these results, it is argued that, for learning visual problem solving in a visual and knowledge-intensive domain, it is not only important to externalise master performance, but also that of the apprentice. © 2018, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050084958"

With this in hand, additional research questions can be addressed including: how do simulation instructional design features (fidelity, range of task difficulty, feedback, etc.) affect engagement?

As single instruments do not provide the information required to reach a robust judgment of integral performance, 73 guidelines for programmatic assessment design were developed. When simultaneously applying these interrelated guidelines, it is challenging to keep a clear overview of all assessment activities. The goal of this study was to provide practical support for applying a programmatic approach to assessment design, not bound to any specific educational paradigm. The guidelines were first applied in a postgraduate medical training setting, and a process analysis was conducted. This resulted in the identification of four steps for programmatic assessment design: evaluation, contextualisation, prioritisation and justification. Firstly, the (re)design process starts with sufficiently detailing the assessment environment and formulating the principal purpose. Key stakeholders with sufficient (assessment) expertise need to be involved in the analysis of strengths and weaknesses and identification of developmental needs. Central governance is essential to balance efforts and stakes with the principal purpose and decide on prioritisation of design decisions and selection of relevant guidelines. Finally, justification of assessment design decisions, quality assurance and external accountability close the loop, to ensure sound underpinning and continuous improvement of the assessment programme. © 2017, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85010711870"

For educational purposes, it is important to identify visual search patterns that are related to high perceptual performance and to identify effective teaching strategies. This review of eye-tracking literature in the radiology domain aims to identify visual search patterns associated with high perceptual performance. Databases PubMed, EMBASE, ERIC, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Science were searched using ‘visual perception’ OR ‘eye tracking’ AND ‘radiology’ and synonyms. Two authors independently screened search results and included eye tracking studies concerning visual skills in radiology published between January 1, 1994 and July 31, 2015. Two authors independently assessed study quality with the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument, and extracted study data with respect to design, participant and task characteristics, and variables. A thematic analysis was conducted to extract and arrange study results, and a textual narrative synthesis was applied for data integration and interpretation. The search resulted in 22 relevant full-text articles. Thematic analysis resulted in six themes that informed the relation between visual search and level of expertise: (1) time on task, (2) eye movement characteristics of experts, (3) differences in visual attention, (4) visual search patterns, (5) search patterns in cross sectional stack imaging, and (6) teaching visual search strategies. Expert search was found to be characterized by a global-focal search pattern, which represents an initial global impression, followed by a detailed, focal search-to-find mode. Specific task-related search patterns, like drilling through CT scans and systematic search in chest X-rays, were found to be related to high expert levels. One study investigated teaching of visual search strategies, and did not find a significant effect on perceptual performance. Eye tracking literature in radiology indicates several search patterns are related to high levels of expertise, but teaching novices to search as an expert may not be effective. Experimental research is needed to find out which search strategies can improve image perception in learners. © 2016, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978771290"

In this paper, we investigate the effects of vocational interests, previous academic experience, gender and age on SJT performance. The SJT was part of the selection process for the Bachelor’s degree programme in Medicine at University of Groningen, the Netherlands. All applicants for the academic year 2015–2016 were included and had to choose between learning communities Global Health (n = 126), Sustainable Care (n = 149), Intramural Care (n = 225), or Molecular Medicine (n = 116). This choice was used as a proxy for vocational interest. In addition, all graduate-entry applicants for academic year 2015–2016 (n = 213) were included to examine the effect of previous academic experience on performance. We used MANCOVA analyses with Bonferroni post hoc multiple comparisons tests for applicant performance on a six-scenario SJT. The MANCOVA analyses showed that for all scenarios, the independent variables were significantly related to performance (Pillai’s Trace: 0.02–0.47, p < .01). Vocational interest was related to performance on three scenarios (p < .01). Graduate-entry applicants outperformed all other groups on three scenarios (p < .01) and at least one other group on the other three scenarios (p < .01). Female applicants outperformed male applicants on three scenarios (p < .01) and age was positively related to performance on two scenarios (p < .05). A good fit between applicants’ vocational interests and SJT scenario was related to better performance, as was previous academic experience. Gender and age were related to performance on SJT scenarios in different settings. Especially the first effect might be helpful in selecting appropriate candidates for areas of health care in which more professionals are needed. © 2017, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008517851"

The purpose of the present research is therefore to further our understanding of how assessors form judgments when interpreting the complex data included in a competency-based portfolio. Eighteen assessors appraised one of three competency-based mock portfolios while thinking aloud, before taking part in semi-structured interviews. A thematic analysis of the think-aloud protocols and interviews revealed that assessors reached judgments through a 3-phase cyclical cognitive process of acquiring, organizing, and integrating evidence. Upon conclusion of the first cycle, assessors reviewed the remaining portfolio evidence to look for confirming or disconfirming evidence. Assessors were inclined to stick to their initial judgments even when confronted with seemingly disconfirming evidence. Although assessors reached similar final (pass–fail) judgments of students’ professional competence, they differed in their information-processing approaches and the reasoning behind their judgments. Differences sprung from assessors’ divergent assessment beliefs, performance theories, and inferences about the student. Assessment beliefs refer to assessors’ opinions about what kind of evidence gives the most valuable and trustworthy information about the student’s competence, whereas assessors’ performance theories concern their conceptualizations of what constitutes professional competence and competent performance. Even when using the same pieces of information, assessors furthermore differed with respect to inferences about the student as a person as well as a (future) professional. Our findings support the notion that assessors’ reasoning in judgment and decision-making varies and is guided by their mental models of performance assessment, potentially impacting feedback and the credibility of decisions. Our findings also lend further credence to the assertion that portfolios should be judged by multiple assessors who should, moreover, thoroughly substantiate their judgments. Finally, it is suggested that portfolios be designed in such a way that they facilitate the selection of and navigation through the portfolio evidence. © 2017, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031401862"

Research suggests that how clinicians deal with negative emotions can affect clinical decision-making, health service delivery, clinician well-being, attentiveness to patient care and patient satisfaction. Previous research has identified the transition from student to junior doctor (intern) as a particularly challenging time. While many studies have highlighted the presence of emotions during this transition, how junior doctors manage emotions has rarely been considered. We conducted a secondary analysis of narrative data in which 34 junior doctors, within a few months of transitioning into practice, talked about situations for which they felt prepared or unprepared for practice (preparedness narratives) through audio diaries and interviews. We examined these data deductively (using Gross’ theory of emotion regulation: ER) and inductively to answer the following research questions: (RQ1) what ER strategies do junior doctors describe in their preparedness narratives? and (RQ2) at what point in the clinical situation are these strategies narrated? We identified 406 personal incident narratives: 243 (60%) contained negative emotion, with 86 (21%) also containing ER. Overall, we identified 137 ER strategies, occurring prior to (n = 29, 21%), during (n = 74, 54%) and after (n = 34, 25%) the situation. Although Gross’ theory captured many of the ER strategies used by junior doctors, we identify further ways in which this model can be adapted to fully capture the range of ER strategies participants employed. Further, from our analysis, we believe that raising medical students’ awareness of how they can handle stressful situations might help smooth the transition to becoming a doctor and be important for later practice. © 2017, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015682963"

Using both figured worlds theory and dialogical self theory, this study explores how beginning teachers in the field of undergraduate medical education integrate the teacher role into their identity. A qualitative study was performed, involving 18 beginning medical teachers at a Dutch medical school. The teachers were interviewed twice and kept a logbook over a period of 7 months. The study shows that the integration of the teacher role into the teachers’ identity was hampered by the idea that teaching is perceived by others as a low status occupation. Some teachers experienced significant tension because of this, while others showed resilience in resisting the negative associations that were thought to exist regarding teaching. The teachers used five different identity narratives in order to integrate the teacher role into their identity, in which the positions of teacher and doctor or researcher were found to be combined, adopted or rejected in diverse ways. The five identity narratives were: (1) coalition between the I-position of teacher and other I-positions; (2) no integration of the I-position of teacher: holding on to other I-positions; (3) construction of the I-position of teacher and other I-positions as opposites; (4) coalition between the I-position of teacher and a third position of coordinator; and (5) meta-position: trivialising the importance of status.

The resulting ‘idiosyncratic rater variance’ is considered to be unusable error of measurement in psychometric models and is a threat to the defensibility of our assessments. Prior studies of inter-rater variation in clinical assessments have used open response formats to gather raters’ comments and justifications. This design choice allows participants to use idiosyncratic response styles that could result in a distorted representation of the underlying rater cognition and skew subsequent analyses. In this study we explored rater variability using the structured response format of Q methodology. Physician raters viewed video-recorded clinical performances and provided Mini Clinical Evaluation Exercise (Mini-CEX) assessment ratings through a web-based system. They then shared their assessment impressions by sorting statements that described the most salient aspects of the clinical performance onto a forced quasi-normal distribution ranging from “most consistent with my impression” to “most contrary to my impression”. Analysis of the resulting Q-sorts revealed distinct points of view for each performance shared by multiple physicians. The points of view corresponded with the ratings physicians assigned to the performance. Each point of view emphasized different aspects of the performance with either rapport-building and/or medical expertise skills being most salient. It was rare for the points of view to diverge based on disagreements regarding the interpretation of a specific aspect of the performance. As a result, physicians’ divergent points of view on a given clinical performance cannot be easily reconciled into a single coherent assessment judgment that is impacted by measurement error. If inter-rater variability does not wholly reflect error of measurement, it is problematic for our current measurement models and poses challenges for how we are to adequately analyze performance assessment ratings. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84988584511"

This study investigated the effects of item disclosure on the medical licensing examination (MLE), examining test taker performance, psychometric characteristics, and factors affecting pass rates. This paper analyzed examinee performance data (n = 20,455) from 41 medical schools who took the MLE before (2009–2011) and after (2012–2014) the item disclosure policy (5548 total items). Changes in passing rates, performance of examinee, difficulty and reliability of the test, and factors affecting pass rate of the medical licensing examination before and after item disclosure were analyzed. In order to identify changes caused by item disclosure in the effects of student and school variables on the passing rate of MLE, Binary Logistic Hierarchical Linear Model was used. There was no significant change in pass rates before and after item disclosure. There was a modest increase in the proportion of test takers in the high-scoring group, following item disclosure. Degree completion status, gender, age of applicants and school mean were significant factors affecting pass rates, regardless of item disclosure. There was no difference between passing rates before and after item disclosure with respect to student- and school-level variables. Despite potential concerns for changes in test and examinee characteristics, empirical findings indicate that there was no significant difference caused by implementing item disclosure. © 2017, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026522995"

This study explored the predictive effect of admission variables on academic outcomes for health professional students by ethnic grouping. Kaupapa Māori and Pacific research methodologies were used to conduct a quantitative analysis using data for 2686 health professional students [150 Māori, 257 Pacific, 2279, non-Māori non-Pacific (nMnP)]. The predictive effect of admission variables: school decile; attending school in Auckland; type of admission; bridging programme; and first-year bachelor results on academic outcomes: year 2–4 grade point average (GPA); graduating; graduating in the minimum time; and optimal completion for the three ethnic groupings and the full cohort was explored using multiple regression analyses. After adjusting for admission variables, for every point increase in first year bachelor GPA: year 2–4 GPA increased by an average of 0.46 points for Māori (p = 0.0002, 95% CI 0.22, 0.69), 0.70 points for Pacific (p < 0.0001, CI 0.52, 0.87), and 0.55 points for nMnP (p < 0.0001, CI 0.51, 0.58) students. For the total cohort, ethnic grouping was consistently the most significant predictor of academic outcomes. This study demonstrated clear differences in academic outcomes between both Māori and Pacific students when compared to nMnP students. Some (but not all) of the disparities between ethnic groupings could be explained by controlling for admission variables. © 2017, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013810714"

An illustrative example is the Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admission Test (UMAT) used by some medical and dental courses in Australia and New Zealand. The proficiencies of all applicants who sat the UMAT from one to four sittings between 2006 and 2012 were estimated on the same metric using the probabilistic Rasch model. A fit index characterising each profile’s degree of conformity to the model was also calculated. Confirming expectations, mean proficiencies increased with repeated sittings on all three UMAT scales with the greatest difference (which was nevertheless relatively small) between the first two sittings. The fit index showed that the increases in proficiency estimates arose from additional easier items being answered correctly on repeated sittings rather than additional more difficult ones, suggesting that improvements are not on the substantive construct of the variable of assessment but in skills in answering the questions. Although strategies for dealing with the increase in proficiency estimates on repeated sittings could be canvassed, these results suggest that the validity of results on repeated sittings was not compromised. Accordingly, it might be concluded that although particular individuals might improve substantially between sittings, any validity is not likely to be compromised with the possibility that for some applicants, the second sitting might be the most valid. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011681257"

In this multi-site cross-sectional questionnaire study, we examined the value of (different) selection procedures compared to a weighted lottery procedure, which includes direct admission based on top pre-university grade point averages (≥8 out of 10; top-pu-GPA). We also considered whether students had participated in selection, prior to being admitted through weighted lottery. Year-1 (pre-clinical) and Year-4 (clinical) students completed standard validated questionnaires measuring quality of motivation (Academic Self-regulation Questionnaire), strength of motivation (Strength of Motivation for Medical School-Revised) and engagement (Utrecht Work Engagement Scale-Student). Performance data comprised GPA and course credits in Year-1 and clerkship performance in Year-4. Regression analyses were performed. The response rate was 35% (387 Year-1 and 273 Year-4 students). Top-pu-GPA students outperformed selected students. Selected Year-1 students reported higher strength of motivation than top-pu-GPA students. Selected students did not outperform or show better quality of motivation and engagement than lottery-admitted students. Participation in selection was associated with higher engagement and better clerkship performance in Year-4. GPA, course credits and strength of motivation in Year-1 differed between students admitted through different selection procedures. Top-pu-GPA students perform best in the medical study. The few and small differences found raise questions about the added value of an extensive selection procedure compared to a weighted lottery procedure. Findings have to be interpreted with caution because of a low response rate and small group sizes. © 2017, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008215922"

Despite this pressing need, few selection systems in healthcare focus on identifying the potential for creativity and innovation and so this area has been vastly under-researched. As a first step towards understanding how we might select for creativity and innovation, this paper explores the use of a trait-based measure of creativity and innovation potential, and evaluates its efficacy for use in selection for healthcare education. This study uses a sample of 188 postgraduate physicians applying for education and training in UK General Practice. Participants completed two questionnaires (a trait-based measure of creativity and innovation, and a measure of the Big Five personality dimensions) and were also rated by assessors on creative problem solving measured during a selection centre. In exploring the construct validity of the trait-based measure of creativity and innovation, our research clarifies the associations between personality, and creativity and innovation. In particular, our study highlights the importance of motivation in the creativity and innovation process. Results also suggest that Openness to Experience is positively related to creativity and innovation whereas some aspects of Conscientiousness are negatively associated with creativity and innovation. Results broadly support the utility of using a trait-based measure of creativity and innovation in healthcare selection processes, although practically this may be best delivered as part of an interview process, rather than as a screening tool. Findings are discussed in relation to broader implications for placing more priority on creativity and innovation as selection criteria within healthcare education and training in future. © 2017, The Author(s).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008477465"

While the failure-to-fail literature suggests that emotion may be important, little is known about the role of emotion for educators. Secondary analyses were therefore conducted on data exploring 110 trainers’ and trainees’ feedback experiences. Group and individual narrative interviews were conducted across three UK sites. We analysed 333 narratives for emotional talk using textual analysis: Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count. Furthermore, thematic framework analysis was conducted on the trainer narratives to explore aspects of feedback processes that are emotional. An additional in-depth little ‘d’ discourse analysis was conducted on selected trainer narratives to enable us to explore the complex relationship between the whats (reported events) and the hows (emotional talk). Trainer narratives did not differ significantly in positive or negative emotional talk from trainee narratives. By exploring the interplay of the whats and the hows, several aspects of feedback processes were identified as potentially emotional for trainers including trainers being concerned about upsetting learners and worried about patient safety. This was illustrated through numerous linguistic devices to establish emotional tone such as metaphoric talk and laughter. These findings suggest that feedback processes can be emotional for trainers. It highlights the need to better understand the ‘filter’ of emotion for trainers but also to better understand how emotion plays a role in feedback as a complex social process. © 2017, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018264272"

The anticipated increase in the numbers of surgical trainees and the shift to competency-based surgical training places pressures on an already stretched health service. With these pressures in mind, we explored trainers’ and trainees’ experiences of surgical training in a less traditional rotation, an outer metropolitan hospital. We considered practice-based learning theories to make meaning of surgical training in this setting, in particular Actor–network theory. We adopted a qualitative approach and purposively sampled surgical trainers and trainees to participate in individual interviews and focus groups respectively. Transcripts were made and thematically analysed. Institutional human research ethics approval was obtained. Four surgical trainers and fourteen trainees participated. Almost without exception, participants’ report training needs to be well met. Emergent inter-related themes were: learning as social activity; learning and programmatic factors; learning and physical infrastructure; and, learning and organizational structure. This outer metropolitan hospital is suited to the provision of surgical training with the current rotational system for trainees. The setting offers experiences that enable consolidation of learning providing a rich and varied overall surgical training program. Although relational elements of learning were paramount they occurred within a complex environment. Actor–network theory was used to give meaning to emergent themes acknowledging that actors (both people and objects) and their interactions combine to influence training quality, shifting the focus of responsibility for learning away from individuals to the complex interactions in which they work and learn. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978909377"

The results of the analysis revealed that most of the primary studies supported the effectiveness of the small-group learning methods in improving students’ academic achievement with an overall weighted average effect-size of 0.59 in standard deviation units favoring small-group learning methods. The subgroup analysis showed that the various forms of innovative and reform-based small-group learning interventions appeared to be significantly more effective for students in higher levels of college classes (sophomore, junior, and senior levels), students in other countries (non-U.S.) worldwide, students in groups of four or less, and students who choose their own group. The random-effects meta-regression results revealed that the effect sizes were influenced significantly by the instructional duration of the primary studies. This means that studies with longer hours of instruction yielded higher effect sizes and on average every 1 h increase in instruction, the predicted increase in effect size was 0.009 standard deviation units, which is considered as a small effect. These results may help health science and nursing educators by providing guidance in identifying the conditions under which various forms of innovative small-group learning pedagogies are collectively more effective than the traditional lecture-based teaching instruction. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85010832452"

However, much healthcare leadership education focusses on the training and competence of individuals and little attention is paid to the interprofessional workplace and how its inherent complexities might contribute to the emergence of leadership. Underpinned by complexity theory, this research aimed to explore how interprofessional healthcare teams enact leadership at a micro-level through influential acts of organising. A whole (interprofessional) team workplace-based study utilising video-reflexive ethnography occurred in two UK clinical sites. Thematic framework analyses of the video data (video-observation and video-reflexivity sessions) were undertaken, followed by in-depth analyses of human–human and human–material interactions. Data analysis revealed a complex interprofessional environment where leadership is a dynamic process, negotiated and renegotiated in various ways throughout interactions (both formal and informal). Being able to “see” themselves at work gave participants the opportunity to discuss and analyse their everyday leadership practices and challenge some of their sometimes deeply entrenched values, beliefs, practices and assumptions about healthcare leadership. These study findings therefore indicate a need to redefine the way that medical and healthcare educators facilitate leadership development and argue for new approaches to research which shifts the focus from leaders to leadership. © 2016, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007496585"

This study aims to reveal whether the better achievement in clinical training of students selected on the basis of their extracurricular activities could be explained by persistent participation in extracurricular activities during medical school (msECAs). Lottery-admitted and selected student admission groups were compared on their participation in three types of msECAs: (1) research master, (2) important board positions or (3) additional degree programme. Logistic regression was used to measure the effect of admission group on participation in any msECA, adjusted for pre-university GPA. Two-way ANCOVA was used to examine the inter-relationships between admission group, participation in msECAs and clerkship grade, with pre-university GPA as covariate. Significantly more selected students compared to lottery-admitted students participated in any msECA. Participation in msECAs was associated with a higher pre-university GPA for lottery-admitted students only, whereas participation in msECAs was associated with higher clerkship grades for selected students only. These results suggest that persistent participation in extracurricular activities of selected students favours better clinical achievement, supporting the inclusion of ECAs in the selection procedure. More insight in the rationale behind participation in extracurricular activities during medical school may explain differences found between lottery-admitted and selected students. © 2016, The Author(s).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994378379"

Our objective was therefore to explore learning in ‘professionally distant’ contexts. Using paramedic education, where portions of training occur in hospital settings despite preparing students for out-of-hospital work, fifty-three informants (11 current students, 13 recent graduates, 16 paramedic program faculty and 13 program coordinators/directors) took part in five semi-structured focus groups. Participants reflected on the value and role of hospital placements in paramedic student development. All sessions were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. In this context six educational advantages and two challenges were identified when using professionally distant learning environments. Learning could still be associated with features such as (a) engagement through “authenticity”, (b) technical skill development, (c) interpersonal skill development, (d) psychological resilience, (e) healthcare system knowledge and (f) scaffolding. Variability in learning and misalignment with learning goals were identified as potential threats. Learning environments that are professionally distant from eventual practice settings may prove meaningful by providing learners with foundational and preparatory learning experiences for competencies that may be transferrable. This suggests that where learning occurs may be less important than how the experience contributes to the learner’s development and the meaning or value he/she derives from it. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84974801123"

The resultant tensions have not been well characterized, yet their existence suggests that different uses may maintain some value for the user that needs to be better understood. We conducted an empirical form of Discourse Analysis to document the multiple ways in which validity is described, understood, and used in the health professions education field. We created and analyzed an archive of texts identified from multiple sources, including formal databases such as PubMED, ERIC and PsycINFO as well as the authors’ personal assessment libraries. An iterative analytic process was used to identify, discuss, and characterize emerging discourses about validity. Three discourses of validity were identified. Validity as a test characteristic is underpinned by the notion that validity is an intrinsic property of a tool and could, therefore, be seen as content and context independent. Validity as an argument-based evidentiary-chain emphasizes the importance of supporting the interpretation of assessment results with ongoing analysis such that validity does not belong to the tool/instrument itself. The emphasis is on process-based validation (emphasizing the journey instead of the goal). Validity as a social imperative foregrounds the consequences of assessment at the individual and societal levels, be they positive or negative. The existence of different discourses may explain—in part—results observed in recent systematic reviews that highlighted discrepancies and tensions between recommendations for practice and the validation practices that are actually adopted and reported. Some of these practices, despite contravening accepted validation ‘guidelines’, may nevertheless respond to different and somewhat unarticulated needs within health professional education. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84989182859"

To promote deliberate and meaningful learning self-regulated learning skills are foundational. We explored trainees’ learning activities related to patient encounters to better understand what aspects of self-regulated learning contribute to trainees’ development, and to explore supervisor’s role herein. We conducted a qualitative non-participant observational study in seven general practices. During two days we observed trainee’s patient encounters, daily debriefing sessions and educational meetings between trainee and supervisor and interviewed them separately afterwards. Data collection and analysis were iterative and inspired by a phenomenological approach. To organise data we used networks, time-ordered matrices and codebooks. Self-regulated learning supported trainees to increasingly perform independently. They engaged in self-regulated learning before, during and after encounters. Trainees’ activities depended on the type of medical problem presented and on patient, trainee and supervisor characteristics. Trainees used their sense of confidence to decide if they could manage the encounter alone or if they should consult their supervisor. They deliberately used feedback on their performance and engaged in reflection. Supervisors appeared vital in trainees’ learning by reassuring trainees, discussing experience, knowledge and professional issues, identifying possible unawareness of incompetence, assessing performance and securing patient safety. Self-confidence, reflection and feedback, and support from the supervisor are important aspects of self-regulated learning in practice. The results reflect how self-regulated learning and self-entrustment promote trainees’ increased participation in the workplace. Securing organized moments of interaction with supervisors is beneficial to trainees’ self-regulated learning. © 2016, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84992313494"

This potential source of hidden variance can be defined as rating items, which typically comprise an MMI evaluation form. Due to its multi-faceted, repeated measures format, reliability for the MMI has been primarily evaluated using generalizability (G) theory. A key assumption of G theory is that G studies model the most important sources of variance to which a researcher plans to generalize. Because G studies can only attribute variance to the facets that are modeled in a G study, failure to model potentially substantial sources of variation in MMI scores can result in biased estimates of variance components. This study demonstrates the implications of hiding the item facet in MMI studies when true item-level effects exist. An extensive Monte Carlo simulation study was conducted to examine whether a commonly used hidden item, person-by-station (p × s|i) G study design results in biased estimated variance components. Estimates from this hidden item model were compared with estimates from a more complete person-by-station-by-item (p × s × i) model. Results suggest that when true item-level effects exist, the hidden item model (p × s|i) will result in biased variance components which can bias reliability estimates; therefore, researchers should consider using the more complete person-by-station-by-item model (p × s × i) when evaluating generalizability of MMI scores. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84982286182"

Therefore, it is important to clarify the magnitude and direction of changes in empathy during medical school. We employed a scoping review to elucidate trends in students’ empathy changes/differences throughout medical school and examine potential bias associated with research design. The literature published in English, Spanish, Portuguese and French from 2009 to 2016 was searched. Two-hundred and nine potentially relevant citations were identified. Twenty articles met the inclusion criteria. Effect sizes of empathy scores variations were calculated to assess the practical significance of results. Our results demonstrate that scoped studies differed considerably in their design, measures used, sample sizes and results. Most studies (12 out of 20 studies) reported either positive or non-statistically significant changes/differences in empathy regardless of the measure used. The predominant trend in cross-sectional studies (ten out of 13 studies) was of significantly higher empathy scores in later years or of similar empathy scores across years, while most longitudinal studies presented either mixed-results or empathy declines. There was not a generalized international trend in changes in students’ empathy throughout medical school. Although statistically significant changes/differences were detected in 13 out of 20 studies, the calculated effect sizes were small in all but two studies, suggesting little practical significance. At the present moment, the literature does not offer clear conclusions relative to changes in student empathy throughout medical school. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979986958"

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of research evaluating associations between program exposure and outcomes. We conducted systematic literature searches in Pubmed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. Selected studies were required to be scholarly research, involve exposure to fictionalized medical television programming by health professional students, and assess associations between exposure and outcomes. Studies were classified according to quality and factors related to population, exposure, and outcomes. Of 3541 studies identified, 13 met selection criteria. Six studies involved undergraduate medical students, one involved nursing students, two involved both medical and nursing students, two involved medical residents, one involved medical students, residents and attending physicians, and one involved graduate epidemiology students. Mean study quality according to the MERSQI was 8.27. The most commonly assessed television programs were ER and Grey’s Anatomy (six each). Five studies assessed regular viewing habits, and found that fictional medical programs are popular among students and that students recall health topics from episodes. The eight studies that assessed the association with outcomes when using clips as educational tools reported high satisfaction and increased knowledge of the presented health topics. While relatively few published studies have explored influences of fictional medical television on health professional students, those conducted suggest that students often view these television programs independently and that integration of this programming into medical education is feasible and acceptable. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85009243670"

In 2002 the Australian Government mandated that 25% of commencing Australian medical students be of rural origin. Meeting this target has largely been achieved through reduced standards of entry for rural relative to urban applicants. This initiative is based on the assumption that rural origin students will succeed during training, and return to practice in rural locations. One aim of this study was to determine the relationships between student geographical origin (rural or urban), selection scores, and future practice intentions of medical students at course entry and course exit. Two multicentre databases containing selection and future practice preferences (location and specialisation) were combined (5862), representing 54% of undergraduate medical students commencing from 2006 to 2013 across nine Australian medical schools. A second aim was to determine course performance of rural origin students selected on lower scores than their urban peers. Selection and course performance data for rural (461) and urban (1431) origin students commencing 2006–2014 from one medical school was used. For Aim 1, a third (33.7%) of rural origin students indicated a preference for future rural practice at course exit, and even fewer (6.7%) urban origin students made this preference. Results from logistic regression analyses showed significant independent predictors were rural origin (OR 4.0), lower Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank (ATAR) (OR 2.1), or lower Undergraduate Medical and Health Sciences Admissions Test Section 3 (non-verbal reasoning) (OR 1.3). Less than a fifth (17.6%) of rural origin students indicated a preference for future generalist practice at course exit. Significant predictors were female gender (OR 1.7) or lower ATAR (OR 1.2), but not rural origin. Fewer (10.5%) urban origin students indicated a preference for generalist practice at course exit. For Aim 2, results of Mann–Whitney U tests confirmed that slightly reducing selection scores does not result in increased failure, or meaningfully impaired performance during training relative to urban origin students. Our multicentre analysis supports success of the rural origin WP pathway to increase rural student participation in medical training. However, our findings confirm that current selection initiatives are insufficient to address the continuing problem of doctor maldistribution in Australia. We argue for further reform to current medical student selection, which remains largely determined by academic meritocracy. Our findings have relevance to the selection of students into health professions globally. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994137583"

In a context where academic health science centres are increasingly called to be “socially accountable,” ignoring the larger social context of race and racism is something that medical education institutions can little afford to do. However, many such institutions have largely remained silent on the issue of race and racism, both within and outside of healthcare. Most medical education continues to emphasize a primarily biological understanding of race. We argue that a different approach is needed. Highlighting the social construction of race is an essential starting point for educators and trainees to tackle racialized health disparities in our clinics and to challenge racism in our classrooms, educational and research institutions, and communities. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994383055"

The use of self-explanation during learning has the potential to promote and support the development of integrated knowledge by encouraging novices to elaborate on the causal relationship between clinical features and basic science mechanisms. To explore the effect of this strategy, we compared diagnostic efficacy of teaching students (n = 71) the clinical features of four musculoskeletal pathologies using either (1) integrated causal basic science descriptions (BaSci group); (2) integrated causal basic science descriptions combined with self-explanation prompts (SE group); (3) basic science mechanisms segregated from the clinical features (SG group). All participants completed a diagnostic accuracy test immediately after learning and 1-week later. The results showed that the BaSci group performed significantly better compared to the SE (p = 0.019) and SG groups (p = 0.004); however, no difference was observed between the SE and SG groups (p = 0.91). We hypothesize that the structure of the self-explanation task may not have supported the development of a holistic conceptual understanding of each disease. These findings suggest that integration strategies need to be carefully structured and applied in ways that support the holistic story created by integrated basic science instruction in order to foster conceptual coherence and to capitalize on the benefits of cognition integration. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007189950"

Despite being conceptualized within the literature as an educational intervention, communities of practice (CoP) are increasingly being adopted in healthcare as quality improvement initiatives. A qualitative case study approach using in-depth interviews and document analysis was employed to gain insight into the perceptions and attitudes of the HPB surgeons in the CoP. This study demonstrates how an engineered formal or idealized structure of a CoP was created in tension with the natural CoPs that HPB surgeons identified with during and after their training. This tension contributed to the inactive and/or marginal participation by some of the surgeons in the CoP. The findings of this study represent a cautionary tale for such future engineering attempts in two distinct ways: (1) a CoP in surgery cannot simply be created by regulatory agencies, rather they need to be supported in a way to evolve naturally, and (2) when the concept of CoPs is co-opted by governing bodies, it does not necessarily capture the power and potential of situated learning. To ensure CoP sustainability and effectiveness, we suggest that both core and peripheral members need to be more directly involved at the inception of the COP in terms of design, organization, implementation and ongoing management. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020657619"

The argument is that subjective expert raters generally bring desired quality, not just noise, to performance evaluations. While several reviews document the psychometric qualities of the Multiple Mini-Interview (MMI), we currently lack qualitative studies examining what we can learn from MMI raters’ subjectivity. The present qualitative study therefore investigates rater subjectivity or taste in MMI selection interview. Taste (Bourdieu 1984) is a practical sense, which makes it possible at a pre-reflective level to apply ‘invisible’ or ‘tacit’ categories of perception for distinguishing between good and bad. The study draws on data from explorative in-depth interviews with 12 purposefully selected MMI raters. We find that MMI raters spontaneously applied subjective criteria—their taste—enabling them to assess the candidates’ interpersonal attributes and to predict the candidates’ potential. In addition, MMI raters seemed to share a taste for certain qualities in the candidates (e.g. reflectivity, resilience, empathy, contact, alikeness, ‘the good colleague’); hence, taste may be the result of an ongoing enculturation in medical education and healthcare systems. This study suggests that taste is an inevitable condition in the assessment of students’ performance. The MMI set-up should therefore make room for MMI raters’ taste and their connoisseurship, i.e. their ability to taste, to improve the quality of their assessment of medical school candidates. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85030123109"

The purpose of this study was to illustrate how a pedagogical method of collaborative reflection (involving reflective writing, sharing, and discussion) on relational dilemmas with role partners can develop occupational therapists’ professional identity. The course, in which this method was applied, implemented the supervision and peer learning frameworks as related to student’s fieldwork experiences, and is based on the perception of growing from conflicts and exploration. The study is based on analyzing qualitative data of 392 dilemma cases and 196 texts of personal reflection on classroom work of undergraduate students in occupational therapy. A thematic analysis of the case studies revealed six overarching relational dilemmas that novice therapists are often called upon to deal with when working with patients, patients’ families and colleagues from other health professions. Analyzing the personal texts of reflection highlighted the effectiveness of collaborative reflection in bridging the gap between theory and practice, and in helping students develop their professional identity. The method can be adapted to curricula for students and therapists in other health professions, in undergraduate courses, and in group supervision programs. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016103290"

In this study, the authors probe this association on clinical rotations and explore potential mechanisms. All In-Training Evaluation Reports (ITERs) for students on mandatory clerkship rotations from April 1, 2013 to January 31, 2015 were matched with the corresponding student’s rating of their teacher (SRT). The date and time that ITERs and SRTs were submitted was used to divide SRTs into those submitted before versus after the corresponding ITER was submitted. Multilevel, mixed effects linear regression was used to examine the association between SRT, ITER rating, and whether the ITER was submitted before or after SRT. Of 2373 paired evaluations, 1098 (46.3%) SRT were submitted before the teacher had submitted the ITER. There was a significant interaction between explanatory variables: when ITER ratings had not yet been submitted, the regression coefficient for this association was 0.25 (95% confidence interval [0.17, 0.33], p < 0.001), whereas the regression coefficient was significantly higher when ITER ratings were submitted prior to SRT (0.40 [0.31, 0.49], p < 0.001). Finding an association between SRT and ITER when students do not know their ITER ratings suggests that SRTs can capture attributes of effective teaching, but the effect modification when students have access to their ITER rating supports grade satisfaction bias. Further studies are needed to explain the mechanism of grade satisfaction and to identify other biases that may impact the validity of SRT. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85023758969"

Recently, it has been suggested to extend simulations to patients with chronic conditions. Simulations could help patients and caregivers to acquire psychosocial and self-management skills. This approach proved to be effective for the training of healthcare professionals, but its transferability to patients needs to be evaluated. Already, several questions arise. However, by considering simulations as pretexts for debriefing, they enable patients and professionals to assess a concrete situation, implying voluntary and reflexive learning processes. Thus, video recording should be assessed for its role in patient metacognition, defined as knowing about knowing. A taxonomy for simulations dedicated to patients, like that already developed for healthcare professionals, should be considered. Although practical constraints must be identified and addressed, they should not be the primary issue guiding research. The transferability of simulation as an educational technique from professionals to patients and caregivers should be investigated essentially in order to provide a significant benefit to patients. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015072204"

Trustworthy and defensible assessment processes must have favourable evidence of validity, particularly where decisions are considered high stakes. We aimed to organize, collect and interpret validity evidence for a high stakes simulation based assessment strategy for certifying paramedics, using Kane’s validity framework, which some report as challenging to implement. We describe our experience using the framework, identifying challenges, decisions points, interpretations and lessons learned. We considered data related to four inferences (scoring, generalization, extrapolation, implications) occurring during assessment and treated validity as a series of assumptions we must evaluate, resulting in several hypotheses and proposed analyses. We then interpreted our findings across the four inferences, judging if the evidence supported or refuted our proposed uses of the assessment data. Data evaluating “Scoring” included: (a) desirable tool characteristics, with acceptable inter-item correlations (b) strong item-total correlations (c) low error variance for items and raters, and (d) strong inter-rater reliability. Data evaluating “Generalizability” included: (a) a robust sampling strategy capturing the majority of relevant medical directives, skills and national competencies, and good overall and inter-station reliability. Data evaluating “Extrapolation” included: low correlations between assessment scores by dimension and clinical errors in practice. Data evaluating “Implications” included low error rates in practice. Interpreting our findings according to Kane’s framework, we suggest the evidence for scoring, generalization and implications supports use of our simulation-based paramedic assessment strategy as a certifying exam; however, the extrapolation evidence was weak, suggesting exam scores did not predict clinical error rates. Our analysis represents a worked example others can follow when using Kane’s validity framework to evaluate, and iteratively develop and refine assessment strategies. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032472812"

Less is known about interpersonal behaviors such as communication patterns and therapeutic relationship-building, which may have workforce development considerations. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review to identify interpersonal health care provider (HCP) behaviors and attributes related to provider–patient interaction during care in telehealth delivery. Electronic searches were conducted using five indexes/databases: CINAHL, ERIC, PsychInfo, ProQuest Dissertations, PubMed; with hand-searching of the immediate past 10 years of five journals. Search concepts included: communication, telehealth, education, and health care delivery. Of 5261 unique article abstracts initially identified, 338 full-text articles remained after exclusion criteria were applied and these were reviewed for eligibility. Finally, data were extracted from 45 articles. Through qualitative synthesis of the 45 articles, we noted that papers encompassed many disciplines and targeted care to people in many settings including: home care, primary and specialist care, mental health/counseling, and multi-site teams. Interpersonal behaviors were observed though not manipulated through study designs. Six themes were identified: HCP-based support for telehealth delivery; provider–patient interactions during the telehealth event; environmental attributes; and guidelines for education interventions or evaluation of HCP behaviors. Although unable to identify current best practices, important considerations for practice and education did emerge. These include: perceptions of the utility of telehealth; differences in communication patterns such as pace and type of discourse, reliance on visual cues by both provider and patient especially in communicating empathy and building rapport; and confidentiality and privacy in telehealth care delivery. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84989166148"

In clinical reasoning, transfer is improved when trainees experience instruction integrating basic science explanations with clinical signs and symptoms. To test whether integrated instruction has similar effects in procedural skills (i.e., psychomotor skills) training, we studied the impact of instruction that integrates conceptual (why) and procedural (how) knowledge on the retention and transfer of simulation-based lumbar puncture (LP) skill. Medical students (N = 30) were randomized into two groups that accessed different instructional videos during a 60-min self-regulated training session. An unintegrated video provided procedural How instruction via step-by-step demonstrations of LP, and an integrated video provided the same How instruction with integrated conceptual Why explanations (e.g., anatomy) for key steps. Two blinded raters scored post-test, retention, and transfer performances using a global rating scale. Participants also completed written procedural and conceptual knowledge tests. We used simple mediation regression analyses to assess the total and indirect effects (mediated by conceptual knowledge) of integrated instruction on retention and transfer. Integrated instruction was associated with improved conceptual (p < .001) but not procedural knowledge test scores (p = .11). We found no total effect of group (p > .05). We did find a positive indirect group effect on skill retention (Bab = .93, p < .05) and transfer (Bab = .59, p < .05), mediated through participants improved conceptual knowledge. Integrated instruction may improve trainees’ skill retention and transfer through gains in conceptual knowledge. Such integrated instruction may be an instructional design feature for simulation-based training aimed at improving transfer outcomes. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018796410"

The literature suggests multimedia is more difficult for trainees. We hypothesize that pediatric residents score lower in diagnostic skill when clinical vignettes use multimedia rather than text for patient findings. A standardized method was developed to write text-based questions from 60 high-resolution, quality multimedia; a series of expert panels selected 40 questions with both a multimedia and text-based counterpart, and two online tests were developed. Each test featured 40 identical questions with reciprocal and alternating modality (multimedia vs. text). Pediatric residents and rising 4th year medical students (MS-IV) at a single residency were randomized to complete either test stratified by postgraduate training year (PGY). A mixed between-within subjects ANOVA analyzed differences in score due to modality and PGY. Secondary analyses ascertained modality effect in dermatology and respiratory questions using Mann–Whitney U tests, and correlations on test performance to In-service Training Exam (ITE) scores using Spearman rank. Eighty-eight residents and rising interns completed the study. Overall multimedia scores were lower than text-based scores (p = 0.047, ηp         2 = 0.04), with highest disparity in rising interns (MS-IV); however, PGY had a greater effect on scores (p = 0.001, ηp         2 = 0.16). Respiratory questions were not significantly lower with multimedia (n = 9, median 0.71 vs. 0.86, p = 0.09) nor dermatology questions (n = 13, p = 0.41). ITEs correlated significantly with text-based scores (ρ = 0.23–0.25, p = 0.04–0.06) but not with multimedia scores. In physician trainees with less clinical experience, multimedia-based case vignettes are associated with significantly lower scores. These results help shed light on the role of multimedia versus text-based information in CDMS, particularly in less experienced clinicians. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991648562"

However, these remain largely theoretical. The purpose of this study was to explore reasoning tasks in clinical practice during patient admission review. The authors used a constant comparative approach—an iterative and inductive process of coding and recoding—to analyze transcripts from 38 audio-recorded case reviews between junior trainees and their senior residents or attendings. Using a previous list of reasoning tasks, analysis focused on what tasks were performed, when they occurred, and how they related to the other tasks. All 24 tasks were observed in at least one review with a mean of 17.9 (Min = 15, Max = 22) distinct tasks per review. Two new tasks—assess illness severity and patient decision-making capacity—were identified, thus 26 tasks were examined. Three overarching tasks were identified—assess priorities, determine and refine the most likely diagnosis and establish and refine management plans—that occurred throughout all stages of the case review starting from patient identification and continuing through to assessment and plan. A fourth possible overarching task—reflection—was also identified but only observed in four instances across three cases. The other 22 tasks appeared to be context dependent serving to support, expand, and refine one or more overarching tasks. Tasks were non-sequential and the same supporting task could serve more than one overarching task. The authors conclude that these findings provide insight into the ‘what’ and ‘when’ of physician reasoning during case review that can be used to support professional development, clinical training and patient care. In particular, they draw attention to the iterative way in which each task is addressed during a case review and how this finding may challenge conventional ways of teaching and assessing clinical communication and reasoning. They also suggest that further research is needed to explore how physicians decide why a supporting task is required in a particular context. © 2016, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979966324"

Two theoretical arguments, one that supports and one that contradicts this assumption, are proposed to explain the practice location intentions of medical students which we examine in a longitudinal analysis. SES background and future intentions of 351 applicants to an undergraduate medical degree were assessed at Time 1, with intentions re-assessed one year later for 96% of those who were enrolled as medical students. Students from very low (and very high) SES backgrounds indicated lower intention to practice in low SES or medically underserviced areas than those from mid-range SES backgrounds. Males and students from non-English speaking backgrounds indicated less desire to work in low SES areas, perhaps explained by high aspirational motivation. SES accounted for a relatively small amount of variance in practice intentions. Alternate predictors of practice location, including individual values and training effects, and their implications for selection practice, are discussed. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994225750"

Scoring an SJT is more complicated than scoring a knowledge test, because there are no objectively correct answers. The scoring method of an SJT may influence the construct and concurrent validity and the adverse impact with respect to non-traditional students. Previous research has compared only a small number of scoring methods and has not studied the effect of scoring method on internal consistency reliability. This study compared 28 different scoring methods for a rating SJT on internal consistency reliability, adverse impact and correlation with personality. The scoring methods varied on four aspects: the way of controlling for systematic error, and the type of reference group, distance and central tendency statistic. All scoring methods were applied to a previously validated integrity-based SJT, administered to 931 medical school applicants. Internal consistency reliability varied between.33 and.73, which is likely explained by the dependence of coefficient alpha on the total score variance. All scoring methods led to significantly higher scores for the ethnic majority than for the non-Western minorities, with effect sizes ranging from 0.48 to 0.66. Eighteen scoring methods showed a significant small positive correlation with agreeableness. Four scoring methods showed a significant small positive correlation with conscientiousness. The way of controlling for systematic error was the most influential scoring method aspect. These results suggest that the increased use of SJTs for selection into medical school must be accompanied by a thorough examination of the scoring method to be used. © 2016, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991709348"

However, feedback research in medical education has typically focused on information provided by tutors to students with limited exploration of the influence of context. This research seeks to address this gap by exploring the influence of multiple contexts upon feedback processes. Employing video-ethnography methodology we explored feedback in two common contexts for medical student learning: the simulated clinical environment and the medical workplace. Learning and teaching sessions were filmed in each of these contexts, capturing diverse feedback processes. Data were analysed for key themes using a Framework Analysis approach and similarities and differences between the two contexts identified. In total 239 distinct feedback episodes across 28 different teaching and learning sessions were captured, with feedback processes relating to the patient, practice, educational and institutional contexts observed. In this paper, we concentrate on key similarities and differences in feedback processes between the two contexts with respect to six themes: feedback interlocutors, interlocutor positioning, feedback types, feedback foci, feedback styles and feedback milieu. We argue that feedback is inextricably linked to the multiple contexts in which feedback is enacted. It is only by exploring these contextual influences that feedback can be understood more fully. With such understanding we should be better placed to develop interventions capable of improving the long elusive experience of successful feedback. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021756392"

To better understand how and why IPE first took root, but failed to grow, this study examines one of the earliest documented IPE initiatives, which took place at the University of British Columbia between 1960 and 1975. We examined a subset of 110 texts (academic literature, grey literature, and unpublished records) from a larger study that uses Critical Discourse Analysis to trace the emergence of IPE in Canada. We asked how IPE was promoted and received, by whom, for what purposes, and to what effects. Our analysis demonstrates that IPE was promoted as a response to local challenges for the Faculty of Medicine as well as national challenges for Canada’s emerging public healthcare system. These dual exigencies enabled the IPE initiative, but they shaped it in somewhat divergent ways: the former gave rise to its core component (a health sciences centre) and the latter its ultimate purpose (increasing the role of non-medical professions in primary care). Reception of the initiative was complicated by a further tension: nurses and allied health professionals were sometimes represented as independent experts with unique knowledge and skills, and sometimes as assistants or substitutes for medical doctors. We relate the successes and frustrations of this early initiative to particular (mis)alignments of purpose and relationships of power, some of which continue to enable and constrain IPE today. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008194149"

As a practice, altruism is perceived to be in decline in the current generation. A number of educational efforts are underway to reclaim this “lost value” of medicine. In this paper we explore constructions of altruism over a defined period of time through a content analysis of the Canadian and Australian Medical Associations (CMA and AMA respectively) Codes of Ethics. We analyzed all editions of both Codes (1868–2004), using a content analysis approach, including thematic analysis. We coded as altruistic or non-altruistic, respectively, statements in which the interest of the patient is placed ahead of the physician’s and statements in which the interest of the physician is given primacy. We examined the pattern of appearance and disappearance of these statements over time. We identified 13 altruistic and 2 non-altruistic statements across all editions. There is a gradual and uneven loss of altruistic content over time. The CMA Codes of 1938, 1970 and 2004 and the AMA code of 1992 represent significant change points. The most recent versions of both Codes contain only 1 altruistic statement and both non-altruistic statements. We conclude that altruism appears to be a fluid and changing concept over time. Loss of altruism is not merely a current generational issue but extends through the past century and is likely due to political and social forces. These results call into question current educational attempts to reclaim altruism, and point to the social evolution of the ideal. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991320875"

Although this topic has been well explored in non-Western cultures within Western contexts, the authors explore how Taiwanese medical students trained in Western medicine address intercultural professionalism dilemmas related to tensions between Western medicine and Taiwanese culture. A narrative interview method was employed with 64 Taiwanese medical students to collect narratives of professionalism dilemmas. Noting the prominence of culture in students’ narratives, we explored this theme further using secondary analysis, identifying tensions between Western medicine and Taiwanese culture and categorizing students’ intercultural professionalism dilemmas according to Friedman and Berthoin Antal’s ‘intercultural competence’ framework: involving combinations of advocacy (i.e., championing one’s own culture) and inquiry (i.e., exploring one’s own and others’ cultures). One or more intercultural dilemmas were identified in nearly half of students’ professionalism dilemma narratives. Qualitative themes included: family relations, local policy, end-of-life care, traditional medicine, gender relations and Taiwanese language. Of the 62 narratives with sufficient detail for further analysis, the majority demonstrated the ‘suboptimal’ low advocacy/low inquiry approach (i.e., withdrawal or inaction), while very few demonstrated the ‘ideal’ high advocacy/high inquiry approach (i.e., generating mutual understanding, so ‘intercultural competence’). Though nearly half of students’ professionalism narratives concerned intercultural dilemmas, most narratives represented disengagement from intercultural dilemmas, highlighting a possible need for more attention on intercultural competence training in Taiwan. The advocacy/inquiry framework may help educators to address similar disconnects between Western medicine and non-Western cultures in other contexts. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84997125502"

The objective of this study is to determine whether academic metrics continue to significantly influence interviewers’ scores in holistic processes by blinding interviewers to applicants’ undergraduate grade point averages (uGPA) and Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). This study examines academic and demographic predictors of interview scores for two applicant cohorts at the University of Michigan Medical School. In 2012, interviewers were provided applicants’ uGPA and MCAT scores; in 2013, these academic metrics were withheld from interviewers’ files. Hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to examine the influence of academic and demographic variables on overall cohort interview scores. When interviewers were provided uGPA and MCAT scores, academic metrics explained more variation in interview scores (7.9%) than when interviewers were blinded to these metrics (4.1%). Further analysis showed a statistically significant interaction between cohort and uGPA, indicating that the association between uGPA and interview scores was significantly stronger for the 2012 unblinded cohort compared to the 2013 blinded cohort (β = .573, P < .05). By contrast, MCAT scores had no interactive effects on interviewer scores. While MCAT scores accounted for some variation in interview scores for both cohorts, only access to uGPA significantly influenced interviewers’ scores when looking at interaction effects. Withholding academic metrics from interviewers’ files may promote assessment of nonacademic characteristics independently from academic metrics. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019213086"

However, despite certain advantages their use remains controversial. This paper aims to critically appraise five sources of evidence for the construct validity of the Health Professions Admission Test (HPAT)-Ireland, an aptitude test used for selecting undergraduate medical students. The objectives are to identify gaps in the evidence, draw comparisons with other aptitude tests and outline future research directions. Our appraisal of the literature found that stakeholder feedback indicates that there is reasonable evidence for test content validity for two of the three sections of HPAT-Ireland. By contrast the Non-Verbal Reasoning section is widely criticised as having limited relevance to medical school performance and future clinical practice. In terms of concurrent validity there is a significant small to medium, negative correlation with school exit examinations, but not consistently so across all studies (r = −0.18, −0.28, 0.017). Likewise predictive validity studies vary, from negative to moderate strength correlations with examination performance during early years at medical school. Five studies indicate that HPAT-Ireland is supported in principle by the majority of stakeholders. While one consequence of its introduction is that successful applicants are now coming from more diverse academic backgrounds, there is no evidence that the socio-economic background of medical school entrants has been altered significantly. Negative perceptions of unfairness relating to gender, coaching and socio-economics remain. The evidence to date suggests that while there are slight gender differences, initially favouring males, these vary year on year. In conclusion, the attitudes towards, and performance of, HPAT-Ireland is not unlike that of other aptitude tests widely used internationally. The main justifications for its introduction have been achieved, in that Ireland no longer relies exclusively on a single measure of academic record for selection to medical school. However a number of areas require further research and exploration. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994339092"

For this process to produce valid results, it is important that raters provide quality judgments that are accurate. Unfortunately, the quality of these judgments is variable and the roles of factors that influence the accuracy of those judgments are not clearly understood. One such factor is first impressions: that is, judgments about people we do not know, made quickly and based on very little information. This study explores the influence of first impressions in an OSCE. Specifically, the purpose is to begin to examine the accuracy of a first impression and its influence on subsequent ratings. We created six videotapes of history-taking performance. Each video was scripted from a real performance by six examinee residents within a single OSCE station. Each performance was re-enacted with six different actors playing the role of the examinees and one actor playing the role of the patient and videotaped. A total of 23 raters (i.e., physician examiners) reviewed each video and were asked to make a global judgment of the examinee’s clinical abilities after 60 s (First Impression GR) by providing a rating on a six-point global rating scale and then to rate their confidence in the accuracy of that judgment by providing a rating on a five-point rating scale (Confidence GR). After making these ratings, raters then watched the remainder of the examinee’s performance and made another global rating of performance (Final GR) before moving on to the next video. First impression ratings of ability varied across examinees and were moderately correlated to expert ratings (r = .59, 95% CI [−.13,.90]). There were significant differences in mean ratings for three examinees. Correlations ranged from.05 to.56 but were only significant for three examinees. Rater confidence in their first impression was not related to the likelihood of a rater changing their rating between the first impression and a subsequent rating. The findings suggest that first impressions could play a role in explaining variability in judgments, but their importance was determined by the videotaped performance of the examinees. More work is needed to clarify conditions that support or discourage the use of first impressions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84995460908"

In quantitative research, there are differences in students’ preferences and actual participation in PPE by gender. This novel study qualitatively explores the effect that gender has on medical students’ experiences of learning physical examination through PPE. We employ an interpretative approach to uncover the PPE experiences of students from a European, graduate-entry medical school. Volunteers participated in either individual or group interviews. The data were transcribed, de-identified and analysed using thematic analysis. There was evidence of gender inequity in PPE, with students describing significant imbalances in participation. Male students adopted roles that generated significant personal discomfort and led to fewer experiences as examiners. Assumptions were made by tutors and students about gender roles: male students’ ready acceptance of exposure to be examined and female students’ need to be protected from particular examinations. In contrast with the first assumption, male students did feel coerced or obliged to be examined. Students described their experiences of taking action to break down the gender barrier. Importantly, students reported that tutors played a role in perpetuating inequities. These findings, whilst relating to one university, have implications for all settings where PPE is used. Educators should be vigilant about gender issues and the effect that they may have on students’ participation in PPE to ensure that students are not disadvantaged in their learning. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978719346"

However, pre-interview measures of cognitive skills predict for national licensure scores (Gauer et al. in Med Educ Online 21 2016) and subsequently licensure scores predict for performance in practice (Tamblyn et al. in JAMA 288(23): 3019–3026, 2002; Tamblyn et al. in JAMA 298(9):993–1001, 2007). Assessment of personal and professional characteristics, with the same psychometric rigour of measures of cognitive abilities, are needed upstream in the selection to health profession training programs. To fill that need, Computer-based Assessment for Sampling Personal characteristics (CASPer)—an on-line, video-based screening test—was created. In this paper, we examine the correlation between CASPer and Canadian national licensure examination outcomes in 109 doctors who took CASPer at the time of selection to medical school. Specifically, CASPer scores were correlated against performance on cognitive and ‘non-cognitive’ subsections of both the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination (MCCQE) Parts I (end of medical school) and Part II (18 months into specialty training). Unlike most national licensure exams, MCCQE has specific subcomponents examining personal/professional qualities, providing a unique opportunity for comparison. The results demonstrated moderate predictive validity of CASPer to national licensure outcomes of personal/professional characteristics three to six years after admission to medical school. These types of disattenuated correlations (r = 0.3–0.5) are not otherwise predicted by traditional screening measures. These data support the ability of a computer-based strategy to screen applicants in a feasible, reliable test, which has now demonstrated predictive validity, lending evidence of its validation for medical school applicant selection. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84996526090"

The aim of this study was to gather evidence to support change to the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing-USA Level 2-Performance Evaluation standard setting design and administrative process. Twenty-two video recordings of candidates assessed for clinical competence were randomly selected from the 2014–2015 Humanistic domain test score distribution ranging from the highest to lowest quintile of performance. Nineteen panelists convened at the same site to receive training and practice prior to generating judgments of qualified or not qualified performance to each of the twenty videos. At the end of training, one panel remained onsite to complete their judgments and the second panel was released and given 1 week to observe the same twenty videos and complete their judgments offsite. The two one-sided test procedure established equivalence between panel group means at the 0.05 confidence level, controlling for rater errors within each panel group. From a practical cost-effective and administrative resource perspective, results from this study suggest it is possible to diverge from typical panel groups, who are sequestered the entire time onsite, to larger numbers of panelists who can make their judgments offsite with little impact on judged samples of qualified performance. Standard setting designs having panelists train together and then allowing those to provide judgments yields equivalent ratings and, ultimately, similar cut scores. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013447158"

In order to prevent or reduce burnout in medical residents, we should gain a better understanding of contributing and protective factors of burnout. Therefore we examined the associations of job demands and resources, home demands and resources, and work–home interferences with burnout in male and female medical residents. This study was conducted on a nation-wide sample of medical residents. In 2005, all Dutch medical residents (n = 5245) received a self-report questionnaire on burnout, job and home demands and resources and work–home interference. Path analysis was used to examine the associations between job and home characteristics and work–home interference and burnout in both males and females. In total, 2115 (41.1 %) residents completed the questionnaire. In both sexes emotional demands at work and the interference between work and home were important contributors to burnout, especially when work interferes with home life. Opportunities for job development appeared to be an important protective factor. Other contributing and protective factors were different for male and female residents. In females, social support from family or partner seemed protective against burnout. In males, social support from colleagues and participation in decision-making at work seemed important. Effectively handling emotional demands at work, dealing with the interference between work and home, and having opportunities for job development are the most essential factors which should be addressed. However it is important to take gender differences into consideration when implementing preventive or therapeutic interventions for burnout in medical residents. © 2016, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84988600729"

In previous studies on self-explanation, students were free to self-explain any aspect of the case, and mostly clinical knowledge was used. Elaboration on knowledge of pathophysiological mechanisms of diseases has been largely unexplored in studies of strategies for teaching clinical reasoning. The purpose of this two-phase experiment was to investigate the effect of self-explanation of pathophysiology during practice with clinical cases on students’ diagnostic performance. In the training phase, 39 4th-year medical students were randomly assigned to solve 6 criterion cases (3 of jaundice; 3 of chest pain), either self-explaining the pathophysiological mechanisms of the findings (n = 20) or without self-explaining (n = 19). One-week later, in the assessment phase, all students solved 6 new cases of the same syndromes. A repeated-measures analysis of variance on the mean diagnostic accuracy scores showed no significant main effects of study phase (p = 0.34) and experimental condition (p = 0.10) and no interaction effect (p = 0.42). A post hoc analysis found a significant interaction (p = 0.022) between study phase and syndrome type. Despite equal familiarity with jaundice and chest pain, the performance of the self-explanation group (but not of the non-self-explanation group) on jaundice cases significantly improved between training and assessment phases (p = 0.035) whereas no differences between phases emerged on chest pain cases. Self-explanation of pathophysiology did not improve students’ diagnostic performance for all diseases. Apparently, the positive effect of this form of self-explanation on performance depends on the studied diseases sharing similar pathophysiological mechanisms, such as in the jaundice cases. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011300312"

Curricula for faculty development programs are often based on expert frameworks without consideration of the learning priorities as defined by clinical supervisors themselves. We sought to inform these curricula by highlighting clinical supervisors own requirements through answering the research question: what do clinical supervisors identify as relative strengths and areas for improvement in their teaching practice? This mixed methods study employed a modified version of the Maastricht Clinical Teaching Questionnaire (mMCTQ) which included free-text reflections. Descriptive statistics were calculated and content analysis was conducted on textual comments. 481 (49%) of 978 clinical supervisors submitted their mMCTQs and associated reflections for the research study. Clinical supervisors self-identified relatively strong capability with interpersonal skills or attributes and indicated least capability with assisting learners to explore strengths, weaknesses and learning goals. The qualitative category ‘establishing relationships’ was the most reported strength with 224 responses. The qualitative category ‘feedback’ was the most reported area for improvement, with 151 responses. Key areas for curricular focus include: improving feedback practices; stimulating reflective and agentic learning; and managing the logistics of a clinical education environment.

To address this at the point of selection, “non-cognitive” tests were included in the UK Clinical Aptitude Test, the most widely-used aptitude test in UK medical education (UKCAT: http://www.ukcat.ac.uk/). We examined the predictive validity of these non-cognitive traits with performance during and on exit from medical school. We sampled all students graduating in 2013 from the 30 UKCAT consortium medical schools. Analysis included: candidate demographics, UKCAT non-cognitive scores, medical school performance data—the Educational Performance Measure (EPM) and national exit situational judgement test (SJT) outcomes. We examined the relationships between these variables and SJT and EPM scores. Multilevel modelling was used to assess the relationships adjusting for confounders. The 3343 students who had taken the UKCAT non-cognitive tests and had both EPM and SJT data were entered into the analysis. There were four types of non-cognitive test: (1) libertariancommunitarian, (2) NACE—narcissism, aloofness, confidence and empathy, (3) MEARS—self-esteem, optimism, control, self-discipline, emotional-nondefensiveness (END) and faking, (4) an abridged version of 1 and 2 combined. Multilevel regression showed that, after correcting for demographic factors, END predicted SJT and EPM decile. Aloofness and empathy in NACE were predictive of SJT score. This is the first large-scale study examining the relationship between performance on non-cognitive selection tests and medical school exit assessments. The predictive validity of these tests was limited, and the relationships revealed do not fit neatly with theoretical expectations. This study does not support their use in selection. © 2016, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84990854063"

Validity in WBA mainly depends on how stakeholders (e.g. clinical supervisors and learners) use the assessments—rather than on the intrinsic qualities of instruments and methods. Current research on assessment in clinical contexts seems to imply that variable behaviours during performance assessment of both assessors and learners may well reflect their respective beliefs and perspectives towards WBA. We therefore performed a Q methodological study to explore perspectives underlying stakeholders’ behaviours in WBA in a postgraduate medical training program. Five different perspectives on performance assessment were extracted: Agency, Mutuality, Objectivity, Adaptivity and Accountability. These perspectives reflect both differences and similarities in stakeholder perceptions and preferences regarding the utility of WBA. In comparing and contrasting the various perspectives, we identified two key areas of disagreement, specifically ‘the locus of regulation of learning’ (i.e., self-regulated versus externally regulated learning) and ‘the extent to which assessment should be standardised’ (i.e., tailored versus standardised assessment). Differing perspectives may variously affect stakeholders’ acceptance, use—and, consequently, the effectiveness—of assessment programmes. Continuous interaction between all stakeholders is essential to monitor, adapt and improve assessment practices and to stimulate the development of a shared mental model. Better understanding of underlying stakeholder perspectives could be an important step in bridging the gap between psychometric and socio-constructivist approaches in WBA. © 2017, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011681332"

Among these are simulated patients (SPs), who, through role-playing, assist students to develop their communication and physical examination skills, in contexts of formative and summative assessments. This paper explores the teaching and learning relationship between medical students and SPs, and considers how this might affect feedback and assessment. 14 SPs were interviewed on the subject of medical students’ professional identity development in 2014. Data were examined using narrative analysis in conjunction with positioning theory to identify the positions that SPs assigned to themselves and to students. Narrative analysis yielded three interpretative positioning themes: Occupational, familial and cultural and discursive and embodied positioning. The interview process revealed that SPs adopt different positions intra-and interpersonally. SPs appear to hold dissonant perceptions of students in terms relating to their emerging professional identities, which may confound assessment and feedback. Training should include reflections on the SP/student relationship to uncover potential biases and positions, giving SPs the opportunity to reflect on and manage their individual and occupational selves. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84976288720"

This longitudinal, population based observational study was conducted to test the fit of three theories—knowledge encapsulation, independent influence, distinct domains—of the development of medical expertise employing structural equation modelling. Data were collected from 548 physicians (292 men—53.3%; 256 women—46.7%; mean age = 24.2 years on admission) who had graduated from medical school 2009–2014. They included (1) Admissions data of undergraduate grade point average and Medical College Admission Test sub-test scores, (2) Course performance data from years 1, 2, and 3 of medical school, and (3) Performance on the NBME exams (i.e., Step 1, Step 2 CK, and Step 3). Statistical fit indices (Goodness of Fit Index—GFI; standardized root mean squared residual—SRMR; root mean squared error of approximation—RSMEA) and comparative fit (XD2,X2) of three theories of cognitive development of medical expertise were used to assess model fit. There is support for the knowledge encapsulation three factor model of clinical competency (GFI = 0.973, SRMR = 0.043, RSMEA = 0.063) which had superior fit indices to both the independent influence and distinct domains theories (X292=88.11 vs X292=443.91 [XD2=355.80] vs X292=514.93 [XD2=426.82], respectively).

It has been well established that individuals exhibit sequential context effects in psychophysical experiments involving unidimensional stimuli. Recent evidence shows that these effects generalize to quantitative judgments of more complex multidimensional stimuli such as images of faces, chairs, and shoes. In this article, we test for the presence of sequential context effects by re-examining previously published data on categorical judgments of 234 complex radiographic images made by 20 experienced physicians and 20 medical students engaged in an online training task. We found that medical students, but not experienced physicians, displayed evidence of sequential context effects. We also found evidence suggesting that as the students learned over blocks of trials, they tended to shift from relative comparisons between consecutive images toward more independent comparisons of each image against (strengthening) internalized standards. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84976274372"

Although the construct measured by both of these metrics is thought to represent overall cognitive load, there is a paucity of studies that compares these techniques to one another. The authors compared data obtained from one physiologic tool (pupillometry) to one psychometric tool (Paas scale) to explore whether they actually measured the construct of cognitive load as purported. Thirty-two participants with a range of resuscitation medicine experience and expertise completed resuscitation-medicine based multiple-choice-questions as well as arithmetic questions. Cognitive load, as measured by both tools, was found to be higher for the more difficult questions as well as for questions that were answered incorrectly (p < 0.001). The group with the least medical experience had higher cognitive load than both the intermediate and experienced groups when answering domain-specific questions (p = 0.023 and p = 0.003 respectively for the physiologic tool; p = 0.006 and p < 0.001 respectively for the psychometric tool).

The IRAP, however, allows for a deeper analysis of implicit attitudes with respect to both thin and fat in isolation, and it was found that medical students are, on average, actually both pro-thin and pro-fat, and on average are more pro-thin than pro-fat, as opposed to anti-fat. Additionally, it was found that medical students’ implicit weight bias against fat/obese individuals improved over the first 2 years of medical training, and this improvement was specifically driven by improved implicit attitudes toward overweight and obese, while implicit attitudes toward thin remained constant over that time. The implications of more sensitive implicit bias assessment and specific changes in bias over time are discussed within the context of medical education curriculum development. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991109144"

Compassion and compassionate care are fundamental elements of this relational space. Traditionally, health professions educators and leaders have gone to two narrative sources when attempting to better under constructs of compassion: patients or providers. Rarely have there been explorations of the perspectives of those who consider themselves as both patients and providers. In this study, we interviewed nineteen health care providers who self-disclosed as having had a substantive patient experience in the health care system. We engaged with these participants to better understand their experience of having these dual roles. Anchored in Foucault’s concepts of subjectivity and Goffman’s symbolic interactionism, the interviews in this study reveal practices of moving between the two roles of patient and provider. Through this exploration, we consider how it is that providers who have been patients understand themselves to be more compassionate whilst in their provider roles. Rather than describing compassion as a learnable behaviour or an innate virtue, we theoretically engage with one proposed mechanism of how compassion is produced. In particular, we highlight the role of critical reflexivity as an underexplored construct in the enactment of compassion.

In this Reflection, the authors discuss motives for educational inflation and suggest that these are likely innocent, well-intentioned, and subconscious—and include both a propensity to increase expectations of ourselves and others over time, and a reluctance to reduce training content and expectations. They then discuss potential risks of educational inflation, including reduced emphasis on core knowledge and clinical skills, and adverse effects on the emotional, psychological, and financial wellbeing of students. While acknowledging the need to change curricula to improve learning and clinical outcomes, the authors proffer that it is naïve to assume that we can inflate educational expectations at no additional cost. They suggest that before implementing and/or mandating change, we should consider of all the costs that medical schools and students might incur, including opportunity costs and the impact on the emotional and financial wellbeing of students. They propose a cost-effectiveness framework for medical education and advocate prioritization of interventions that improve learning outcomes with no additional costs or are cost-saving without adversely impacting learning outcomes. When there is an additional cost for improved learning outcomes or a decline in learning outcomes as a result of cost saving interventions, they suggest careful consideration and justification of this trade-off. And when there are neither improved learning outcomes nor cost savings they recommend resisting the urge to change. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983458906"

In this paper, we examine the effect of (1) participation, and (2) selection in a voluntary selection process on study performance. We included data from two cohorts of medical students admitted to Erasmus MC, Rotterdam and VUmc, Amsterdam, The Netherlands and compared them to previously published data from Groningen medical school, The Netherlands. All included students were admitted based on either (1) a top pre-university grade point average, or (2) a voluntary selection process, or (3) weighted lottery. We distinguished between lottery-admitted students who had participated in the voluntary selection process and had been rejected, and lottery-admitted students who had not participated. Knowledge test scores, study progress, and professionalism scores were examined using ANCOVA modelling, logistic regression, and Bonferroni post hoc multiple-comparison tests, controlling for gender and cohort. For written test grades, results showed a participation effect at Groningen medical school and Erasmus MC (p < 0.001), and a selection effect at VUmc (p < 0.05). For obtained course credits, results showed a participation effect at all universities (p < 0.01) and a selection effect at Groningen medical school (p < 0.005). At Groningen medical school, a participation effect seemed apparent in on time first-year completion (p < 0.05). Earlier reported selection and participation effects in professionalism scores at Groningen medical school were not apparent at VUmc. Top pre-university students performed well on all outcome measures. For both the participation effect and the selection effect, results differed between universities. Institutional differences in curricula and in the design of the selection process seem to mediate relations between the different admissions processes and performance. Further research is needed for a deeper understanding of the influence of institutional differences on selection outcomes. © 2017, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85012154561"

With this recognition, health professions education is grappling with how to factor team competence into training and assessment strategies. These efforts are impeded, however, by the absence of a sophisticated understanding of the the relationship between competent individuals and competent teams. Using data from a constructivist grounded theory study of team-based healthcare for patients with advanced heart failure, this paper explores the relationship between individual team members’ perceived goals, understandings, values and routines and the collective competence of the team. Individual interviews with index patients and their healthcare team members formed Team Sampling Units (TSUs). Thirty-seven TSUs consisting of 183 interviews were iteratively analysed for patterns of convergence and divergence in an inductive process informed by complex adaptive systems theory. Convergence and divergence were identifiable on all teams, regularly co-occurred on the same team, and involved recurring themes. Convergence and divergence had nonlinear relationships to the team’s collective functioning. Convergence could foster either shared action or collective paralysis; divergence could foster problematic incoherence or productive disruption. These findings advance our understanding of the complex relationship between the individual and the collective on a healthcare team, and they challenge conventional narratives of healthcare teamwork which derive largely from acute care settings and emphasize the importance of common goals and shared mental models. Complex adaptive systems theory helps us to understand the implications of these insights for healthcare teams’ delivery of care for the complex, chronically ill. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85010739306"

We investigate if continuous in-task (IT) or end-task feedback (ET) is more effective in teaching spinal anaesthesia to medical students. End-task feedback was hypothesized to improve both short-term and long-term procedural learning retention as experiential learning promotes active learning after encountering errors during practice. Upon exposure to a 5-min instructional video, students randomized to IT or ET feedbacks were trained using a spinal simulator mannequin. A blinded expert tested the students using a spinal anaesthesia checklist in the short term (immediate) and long-term (average 4 months). Sixty-five students completed the training and testing. There were no differences in demographics of age or gender within IT or ET distributions. Both short-term and long-term learning retention of spinal anaesthesia ET feedback proved to be better (P < 0.01) than IT feedback. The time taken for ET students was shorter at long-term testing. End-task feedback improves both short-term and long-term procedural learning retention. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84980028108"

Essentially, a number of authors raised doubt about the appropriateness of psychometric models as a guiding framework to secure and refine current approaches to the assessment of medical competence. In addition, an intriguing phenomenon known as case specificity is specific to the controversy on the use of psychometric models for the assessment of medical competence. Broadly speaking, case specificity is the finding of instability of performances across clinical cases, tasks, or problems. As stability of performances is, generally speaking, a central assumption in psychometric models, case specificity may limit their applicability. This has probably fueled critiques of the field of psychometrics with a substantial amount of potential empirical evidence. This article aimed to explain the fundamental ideas employed in psychometric theory, and how they might be problematic in the context of assessing medical competence. We further aimed to show why and how some critiques do not hold for the field of psychometrics as a whole, but rather only for specific psychometric approaches. Hence, we highlight approaches that, from our perspective, seem to offer promising possibilities when applied in the assessment of medical competence. In conclusion, we advocate for a more differentiated view on psychometric models and their usage. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015625871"

Extended student engagement in community settings provide the advantages of educational continuity as well as increased service provision in underserved areas. Developing and maintaining LICs require a differing approach to student learning than that for traditional placements. There has been little theoretically informed empirical research that has offered explanations of which are the important factors that promote student learning in LICs and the relationships between those factors. We explored the relationship between student learning, student perceptions of preparedness for practice and student engagement, in the context of a rural LIC. We used a sequential qualitative design employing thematic, comparative and relational analysis of data from student interviews (n = 18) to understand possible processes and mechanisms of student learning in the LIC. Through the theoretical lens of social learning systems, we identified two major themes; connectivity and preparedness for practice. Connectivity described engagement and relationship building by students, across formal and informal learning experiences, interprofessional interactions, social interactions with colleagues, interaction with patients outside of the clinical setting, and the extent of integration in the wider community. Preparedness for practice, reflected students’ perceptions of having sufficient depth in clinical skills, personal and professional development, cultural awareness and understanding of the health system, to work in that system. A comparative analysis compared the nature and variation of learning across students. In a relational analysis, there was a positive association between connectivity and preparedness for practice. Connectivity is a powerful enabler of students’ agentic engagement, collaboration, and learning within an LIC. It is related to student perceptions of preparedness for practice. These findings provide insight for institutions wishing to develop similar programmes, by encouraging health professional educators to consider all of the potential elements of the placements, which most promote connectivity. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85001119073"

The Integrating Theory, Evidence and Action method was used to synthesise all published evidence from 2011 to 2015, which addressed instructional practices used for evidence based practice with pre-registration allied health students. Seventeen articles were found to meet the inclusion criteria, and were analysed for both their individual rigour and relationship to the five recommendations. The evidence reviewed in this study was diverse in both its geographical setting and the allied health disciplines represented. Most of the evidence used less rigorous methods, and the evidence base is generally exploratory in nature. To date, the five recommendations regarding instructional practices in this area have been implemented to varying degrees. Many current practices promote social negotiation, collaborative decision-making and collaborative learning, so the social constructivist approach is being adopted. However, the prior knowledge of students is not being assessed as a basis for scaffolding, communication of evidence based practice to varying audiences is rarely addressed and the role of clinicians in the learning of evidence based practice knowledge, skills, beliefs and attitudes remains limited. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84980041674"

(2) Are there differences between students who were more exposed to TBL than students who were less exposed to TBL? (3) To which extent does cognitive engagement fluctuate as a function of the different activities involved in TBL? And (4) How do cognitive engagement scores collected over time correlate with each other and with academic achievement? The studies were conducted with Year-1 and -2 medical students enrolled in a TBL curriculum (N = 175, 62 female). In both studies, six measurements of cognitive engagement were taken during the distinct TBL activities (preparation phase, individual/team readiness assurance test, burning questions, and application exercises). Data were analysed by means of one-way repeated-measures ANOVAs and path modelling. The results of the repeated-measures ANOVA revealed that cognitive engagement systematically fluctuated as a function of the distinct TBL activities. In addition, Year-1 students reported significantly higher levels of cognitive engagement compared to Year-2 students. Finally, cognitive engagement was a significant predictor of performance (β = .35). The studies presented in this paper are a first attempt to relate the different activities undertaken in TBL with the extent to which they arouse cognitive engagement with the task at hand. Implications of these findings for TBL are discussed. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85032798816"

In so doing, they conceptualised their future selves as adding clinical reasoning and diagnostic skills to the patient-centred caring ethic of their nursing practice, becoming a multi-skilled community member or helping to fix the health care culture. By customising their identities, e.g. by splinting (aligning with their stronger nursing identity), by enriching current nursing practice with newly acquired theory as medical students or by patching a perceived deficiency (i.e. patient-centredness) in medicine, they tailored their identities. Their journeys had, however, not been the natural progression they had anticipated, threatened by perceived and/or real intrinsic (e.g. working as nurses whilst studying medicine) and extrinsic (e.g. interprofessional rivalry) factors. Rather than being accepted as legitimate newcomers to the medical profession, the women sometimes felt like intruders. Some nursing colleagues accused them of desertion. In response, they generally withheld their identities as nurses or medical students, compartmentalising their group membership. This study has highlighted the role of personal (e.g. prior experience; agency; resilience; personality) and contextual factors in ‘becoming’ a doctor. A recommendation emerging from this study is the need for interprofessional learning in the medical curriculum to cultivate a health care culture of collaboration rather than competition. Future research is required in terms of how allied health professionals transition to medicine. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979987728"

Whilst linked to a political rhetoric of inclusive education such initiatives have however failed to significantly increase the number of such students entering medicine. This is compounded by a discourse that portrays WA applicants and students as lacking the essential skills or attributes to be successful in medical education. Much of the research in this area to date has been weak and it is critical to better understand how WA applicants and students negotiate medical admissions and education to inform change. To address this gap we amalgamated a larger dataset from three qualitative studies of student experiences of WA to medicine (48 participants in total). Inductively analysing the findings using social capital as a theoretical lens we created and clustered codes into categories, informed by the concepts of “weak ties” and “bridging and linking capital”, terms used by previous workers in this field, to better understand student journeys in medical education. Successful applicants from lower socio-economic groups recognise and mobilise weak ties to create linking capital. However once in medical school these students seem less aware of the need for, or how to create, capital effectively. We argue WA activities should support increasing the social capital of under-represented applicants and students, and future selection policy needs to take into account the varying social capital of students, so as to not overtly disadvantage some social groups. © 2016, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84995388243"

The purpose of this review was to evaluate the use of cognitive apprenticeship theory with the primary aim of understanding how and to what extent the theory has been applied to the design, implementation, and analysis of education in the health sciences. The initial search yielded 149 articles, with 45 excluded because they contained the term “cognitive apprenticeship” only in reference list. The remaining 104 articles were categorized using a theory talk coding scheme. An in depth qualitative synthesis and review was conducted for the 26 articles falling into the major theory talk category. Application of cognitive apprenticeship theory tended to focus on the methods dimension (e.g., coaching, mentoring, scaffolding), with some consideration for the content and sociology dimensions. Cognitive apprenticeship was applied in various disciplines (e.g., nursing, medicine, veterinary) and educational settings (e.g., clinical, simulations, online). Health sciences education researchers often used cognitive apprenticeship to inform instructional design and instrument development. Major recommendations from the literature included consideration for contextual influences, providing faculty development, and expanding application of the theory to improve instructional design and student outcomes. This body of research provides critical insight into cognitive apprenticeship theory and extends our understanding of how to develop expert thinking in health sciences students. New research directions should apply the theory into additional aspects of health sciences educational research, such as classroom learning and interprofessional education. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84982295092"

Moreover, to date few researchers have empirically examined the complementary roles of academic and non-academic selection methods in predicting in-role performance. This is an important area of enquiry as despite it being common practice to use both types of methods within a selection system, there is currently no evidence that this approach translates into increased predictive validity of the selection system as a whole, over that achieved by the use of a single selection method. In this preliminary study, the majority of the range of scores achieved by successful applicants to the UK Foundation Programme provided a unique opportunity to address both of these areas of enquiry. Sampling targeted high (>80th percentile) and low (<20th percentile) scorers on the SJT. Supervisors rated 391 trainees’ in-role performance, and incidence of remedial action was collected. SJT and academic performance scores correlated with supervisor ratings (r = .31 and.28, respectively). The relationship was stronger between the SJT and in-role performance for the low scoring group (r = .33, high scoring group r = .11), and between academic performance and in-role performance for the high scoring group (r = .29, low scoring group r = .11). Trainees with low SJT scores were almost five times more likely to receive remedial action. Results indicate that an SJT for entry into trainee physicians’ first role in clinical practice has good predictive validity of supervisor-rated performance and incidence of remedial action. In addition, an SJT and a measure of academic performance appeared to be complementary to each other.

Much of the published literature on DME has focused on the experiences of learners in distributed programs; however, our empirical work leads us to believe that DME changes the context significantly, not only for learners, but also for other important members of the educational community including audiovisual professionals, administrative professionals and faculty teachers. Based on a three-year ethnographic study, we provide a detailed account of how alliances between various workers involved in DME develop to produce and deliver an undergraduate medical curriculum across geographically separate campuses. We explore the question ‘What is the work involved in the delivery of a DME program?’ and cast a critical gaze on the essential but invisible, and therefore potentially unrecognized and underappreciated, contributions of AV professionals, administrative professionals, and faculty teachers. Our goal is to make visible the complexity of DME, including the essential contributions of these workers.

It is arguable, therefore, that selection should focus on non-cognitive aspects despite the predictive value of prior cognitive performance for early medical school performance. The aim of this study at Radboud University Medical Center, the Netherlands, is to determine the effects of admitting students through an autonomous non-cognitive procedure on early medical school performance. We compared their performance to the performance of students selected through an autonomous cognitive selection procedure, enrolling in the Bachelor’s curriculum simultaneously. 574 students (2013 and 2014 cohorts), admitted through non-cognitive selection (based on portfolio, CASPer and MMI, n = 135) or cognitive selection (curriculum sample selection, n = 439) were included in the study. We compared dropout rates, course credits and grades, using logistic and linear regression. The dropout rate was the highest in the non-cognitive selection group (p < 0.001). Students admitted through non-cognitive selection more often obtained the highest grade for the nursing attachment (p = 0.02) and had a higher mean grade for the practical clinical course in year 3 (p = .04). No differences in course grades were found. The results indicate that students perform best on the elements of the curriculum that are represented most strongly in the selection procedure they had participated in. We recommend the use of curriculum sample procedures, resembling the early medical school curriculum,—whether it has a more cognitive or a more non-cognitive focus—, to select the students who are likely to be successful in the subsequent curriculum. © 2017, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020670457"

Decisions to institute remediation are high-stakes—remediation being resource-intensive and emotionally demanding on trainees. Detection of underperformance requiring remediation is particularly problematic in general (family) practice. We sought to establish early-training assessment instruments predictive of general practice (GP) trainees’ subsequently requiring formal remediation. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of trainees from a large Australian regionally-based GP training organization. The outcome factor was requirement for formal remediation. Independent variables were demographic factors and a range of formative assessments conducted immediately prior to or during early-stage training. Analyses employed univariate and multivariate logistic regression of each predictor assessment modality with the outcome, adjusting for potential confounders. Of 248 trainees, 26 (10.5 %) required formal remediation. Performance on the Colleague Feedback Evaluation Tool (entailing feedback from a trainee’s clinical colleagues on clinical performance, communication and probity) and External Clinical Teaching Visits (half-day sessions of the trainee’s clinical consultations observed directly by an experienced GP), along with non-Australian primary medical qualification, were significantly associated with requiring remediation. There was a non-significant trend for association with performance on the Doctors Interpersonal Skills Questionnaire (patient feedback on interpersonal elements of the consultation). There were no significant associations with entry-selection scores or formative exam or assessment scores. Our finding that ‘in vivo’ assessments of complex behaviour, but not ‘in vitro’ knowledge-based assessments, predict need for remediation is consistent with theoretical understanding of the nature of remediation decision-making and should inform remediation practice in GP vocational training. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84992151561"

The applicant sample (n = 530) completed the NEO Personality Inventory whilst applying for one of 60 positions as first-year post-graduate medical interns. Predictive validity was assessed using university grades, averaged over the entire medical degree. Applicant responses for the Big Five (i.e., neuroticism, extraversion, openness, conscientiousness, and agreeableness) and 30 facets of personality were compared to a range of normative samples where personality was measured in standard research settings including medical students, role model physicians, current interns, and standard young-adult test norms. Applicants had substantially higher scores on conscientiousness, openness, agreeableness, and extraversion and lower scores on neuroticism with an average absolute standardized difference of 1.03, when averaged over the normative samples. While current interns, medical students, and especially role model physicians do show a more socially desirable personality profile than standard test norms, applicants provided responses that were substantially more socially desirable. Of the Big Five, conscientiousness was the strongest predictor of academic performance in both applicants (r = .11) and medical students (r = .21). Findings suggest that applicants engage in substantial response distortion, and that the predictive validity of personality is modest and may be reduced in an applicant setting. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031110221"

Partial least squares structural equation modelling was used to explore how students’ summative assessment scores over 4 years of medical school were affected by: attainment in secondary school examinations (GCSEs and A-levels); the Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI) rank associated with students’ home postcodes; the performance of students’ A-level institutions, measured as the percentage of A-level students achieving 3 A-levels at AAB or higher in two or more facilitating subjects. The effects were consistent across time; the final linear regression model used students’ cumulative scores (the basis of the medical school’s UK Foundation Programme submission) as the dependent variable.

This study confirmed the predictive validity of prior academic attainment and found the same inverse relationship between schooling and medical course performance as previous studies. The study found no evidence that socioeconomic background affects course performance; however, students admitted to medicine from poorly performing schools achieve higher academic attainment throughout the course than students admitted from better-performing schools with the same grades.

We conducted a qualitative study in a general practice training setting, triangulating various sources of data to obtain a rich understanding of trainees and supervisors’ experiences: three focus group discussions, five discussions during training sessions and five individual interviews. Thematic network analysis was performed during an iterative process of data collection and analysis. We identified a communication learning cycle consisting of six phases: impactful experience, change in frame of reference, identification of communication strategies, experimentation with strategies, evaluation of strategies and incorporation into personal repertoire. Supervisors supported trainees throughout this process by creating challenges, confronting trainees with their behaviour and helping them reflect on its underlying mechanisms, exploring and demonstrating communication strategies, giving concrete practice assignments, creating safety, exploring the effect of strategies and facilitating repeated practice and reflection. Based on the experiences of trainees and supervisors, we conclude that skilled communication involves the development of a personal communication repertoire from which learners are able to apply strategies that fit the context and their personal style. After further validation of our findings, it may be recommended to give learners concrete examples, opportunities for repeated practise and reflection on personal frames of reference and the effect of strategies, as well as space for authenticity and flexibility. In the workplace, the clinical supervisor is able to facilitate all these essential conditions to support his/her trainee in becoming a skilled communicator. © 2017, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013176791"

Interestingly, research also reveals that learning via observation is greatest when the learner has the opportunity to view both error-free expert demonstrations and flawed novice demonstrations (Rohbanfard and Proteau in Exp Brain Res 215: 183–197, 2011). In this study, we explored whether the learning that results from the combined viewing of experts and novices is greater when the demonstrations are presented under observation schedules characterized by higher levels of contextual interference. To do so, we engaged participants in an observational learning study of the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery pots-and-beans task: a simulated procedure in which performers must move objects under precision constraints in the minimal access surgery environment. Each participant was randomized to one of three groups that engaged in identical physical and mixed-model observational practice of this skill, with the only difference being that one group’s observation was presented in blocked fashion (low interference) while the other two groups’ observations were presented in semi-interleaved (medium interference) and interleaved (high interference) fashions. Total errors and time-to-complete measures taken during physical practice blocks revealed that all three groups improved over the intervention. Further analyses revealed that the low interference group performed better immediately following the physical and observational practice intervention, but that the medium- and high-interference groups were conveyed a performance advantage in a transfer test conducted after a period of retention that challenged participants to perform in the opposite direction. The results are discussed with respect to the classic contextual interference effect (Shea and Morgan in J Exp Psychol 5(2): 179–187, 1979) and with particular relevance to clinical skills education. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85011695281"

Understanding the possible facilitators or barriers to sustainability may help to develop future interventions that are effective in maintaining gender health issues as a topic in medical curricula. The aim of this study is to provide a longitudinal evaluation of changes regarding gender health issues that occurred in the past decade and the factors that influenced this process. The coursebooks of eight theoretical courses of the Nijmegen medical curriculum were screened on the basis of criteria for an integrated gender perspective in medical education. To assess the sustainability of gender health issues, the screening results from 2014 were compared with those of a similar project in 2005. In addition, open interviews were conducted with eight coordinators to identify facilitators and barriers influencing the sustainability of gender health issues. Analysis showed that, over the past decade, the implementation of gender health issues was mainly sustained and additional changes were made, resulting in an ongoing gender perspective in the Nijmegen medical curriculum. The coordinators mentioned several factors that influenced the sustainability of implementation in medical education: coordinators’ and teachers’ gender-sensitive attitude, competing demands, the presence of sex and gender in learning objectives, examinations and evaluation, organizational support and curriculum revisions. Our findings suggest that, in implementing sex and gender in medical education, medical faculties need to focus on top-down support in incorporating sex and gender into core objectives and time spent on incorporating sex and gender into medicine, and on the continuous training of teaching staff. © 2017, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008215904"

We start by presenting evidence that traits are no longer regarded as stable deterministic predictors of behaviour. Instead, traits are found to change across generations, the life span, and in response to environmental contingencies. Thus, there is an urgent need to explore how traits change as function of medical education. Second, drawing on recent theory and research (behavioural reaction norms and the density distribution model) we highlight evidence to show how the expression of trait relevant behaviour is dependent on context, and is distributed with an average (typical behaviour or personality) and a variance (plasticity or adaptability), with traditional personality measure associated with typical responding. Third, we demystify that some traits are better than others showing that so-called “good” traits have a dark-side. Fourth, we show how these developments impact on how personality might be assessed, thereby presenting recent evidence on the use of contextualized personality measures, situational judgment tests, other reports, and implicit measures. Throughout the paper, we outline the key implications of these developments for medical selection practices. © 2017, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013188417"

It seeks to introduce the concept of interprofessional responsibility as both a shift in the way in which to conceptualise the professional identity of Health and Social Care (H&SC) staff and as a new set of practices that help to inform the way in which students are prepared for collaborative working. The presented research, undertaken as part of a Ph.D. study, is based upon semi-structured interviews (n = 33) with H&SC staff who were recruited from both the United Kingdom (UK) Health Service and UK universities. Drawing upon thematic analysis of the data, the results of the research identified that previous conceptualisations of professional identity aligned to a whole profession do not relate to the way in which professionals perceive their identities. Senior professionals claimed to be more comfortable with their own professional identity, and with working across professional boundaries, than junior colleagues. Academic staff also identified that much IPE currently taught in universities serves the purpose of box-ticking rather than being delivered in meaningful way. It is proposed that the findings have implications for the way in which IPE is currently taught, and that adoption of the proposed concept of ‘interprofessional responsibility’ may help address some of the concerns these findings raise. © 2017, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019544855"

This review analysed interventions to support mental health of health professional students and their effects. The full holdings of Medline, PsycINFO, EBM Reviews, Cinahl Plus, ERIC and EMBASE were searched until 15th April 2016. Inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials of undergraduate and post graduate health professional students, group interventions to support mental health compared to alternative education, usual curriculum or no intervention; and post-intervention measurements for intervention and control participants of mindfulness, anxiety, depression, stress/distress or burnout. Studies were limited to English and short term effects. Studies were appraised using the PEDro scale. Data were synthesised using meta-analysis. Four comparisons were identified: psychoeducation or cognitive-behavioural interventions compared to alternative education, and mindfulness or relaxation compared to control conditions. Cognitive-behavioural interventions reduced anxiety (−0.26; −0.5 to −0.02), depression (−0.29; −0.52 to −0.05) and stress (0.37; −0.61 to −0.13). Mindfulness strategies reduced stress (−0.60; −0.97 to −0.22) but not anxiety (95% CI −0.21 to 0.18), depression (95% CI −0.36 to 0.03) or burnout (95% CI −0.36 to 0.10). Relaxation strategies reduced anxiety (SMD −0.80; 95% CI −1.03 to −0.58), depression (−0.49; −0.88 to −0.11) and stress (−0.34; −0.67 to −0.01). Method quality was generally poor. Evidence suggests that cognitive-behavioural, relaxation and mindfulness interventions may support health professional student mental health.

Factors that influence faculty in making use of teaching policy incentives have remained underexplored. Knowledge of these factors is needed to develop theory on the successful implementation of medical teaching policy in university hospitals. To explore factors that influence faculty in making use of teaching policy incentives and to develop a conceptual model for implementation of medical teaching policy in university hospitals. We used the grounded theory methodology. We applied constant comparative analysis to qualitative data obtained from 12 semi-structured interviews conducted at the Radboud University Medical Center. We used a constructivist approach, in which data and theories are co-created through interaction between the researcher and the field and its participants. We constructed a model for the implementation of medical teaching policy in university hospitals, including five factors that were perceived to promote or inhibit faculty in a university hospital to make use of teaching policy incentives: Executive Board Strategy, Departmental Strategy, Departmental Structure, Departmental Culture, and Individual Strategy. Most factors we found to affect individual teachers’ strategies and their use of medical teaching policy lie at the departmental level. If an individual teacher’s strategy is focused on medical teaching and a medical teaching career, and the departmental context offers support and opportunity for his/her development, this promotes faculty’s use of teaching policy incentives. © 2016, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84995389741"

Using situated cognition as the theoretical framework, our aim was to evaluate the verbalized clinical reasoning processes of resident physicians in order to describe what impact the presence of contextual factors have on their clinical reasoning. Participants viewed three video recorded clinical encounters portraying straightforward diagnoses in internal medicine with select patient contextual factors modified. After watching each video recording, participants completed a think-aloud protocol. Transcripts from the think-aloud protocols were analyzed using a constant comparative approach. After iterative coding, utterances were analyzed for emergent themes with utterances grouped into categories, themes and subthemes. Ten residents participated in the study with saturation reached during analysis. Participants universally acknowledged the presence of contextual factors in the video recordings. Four categories emerged as a consequence of the contextual factors: (1) emotional reactions (2) behavioral inferences (3) optimizing the doctor patient relationship and (4) difficulty with closure of the clinical encounter. The presence of contextual factors may impact clinical reasoning performance in resident physicians. When confronted with the presence of contextual factors in a clinical scenario, residents experienced difficulty with closure of the encounter, exhibited as diagnostic uncertainty. This finding raises important questions about the relationship between contextual factors and clinical reasoning activities and how this relationship might influence the cost effectiveness of care. This study also provides insight into how the phenomena of context specificity may be explained using situated cognition theory. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht (outside the USA).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947035972"

Identifying predictors of standardized exam performance could promote primary intervention and lead to design insights for preclinical courses. We hypothesized that clinically relevant courses with an emphasis on higher-order cognitive understanding are most strongly associated with performance on United States Medical Licensing Examination Step exams and National Board of Medical Examiners clinical subject exams. Academic data from students between 2007 and 2012 were collected. Preclinical course scores and standardized exam scores were used for statistical modeling with multiple linear regression. Preclinical courses were categorized as having either a basic science or a clinical knowledge focus. Medical College Admissions Test scores were included as an additional predictive variable. The study sample comprised 795 graduating medical students. Median score on Step 1 was 234 (interquartile range 219–245.5), and 10.2 % (81/795) scored lower than one standard deviation below the national average (205). Pathology course score was the strongest predictor of performance on all clinical subject exams and Step exams, outperforming the Medical College Admissions Test in strength of association. Using Pathology score <75 as a screening metric for Step 1 score <205 results in sensitivity and specificity of 37 and 97 %, respectively, and a likelihood ratio of 11.9. Performance in Pathology, a clinically relevant course with case-based learning, is significantly related to subsequent performance on standardized exams. Multiple linear regression is useful for identifying courses that have potential as risk stratifiers. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941335760"

This study assessed the impact two learning instructional design methods (mental practice and modeling), either on their own or in combination, for teaching complex cognitive medical content when incorporated into enhanced podcasts. Sixty-three medical students were randomised to one of four versions of an airway management enhanced podcast: (1) control: narrated presentation; (2) modeling: narration with video demonstration of skills; (3) mental practice: narrated presentation with guided mental practice; (4) combined: modeling and mental practice. One week later, students managed a manikin-based simulated airway crisis. Knowledge acquisition was assessed by baseline and retention multiple-choice quizzes. Two blinded raters assessed all videos obtained from simulated crises to measure the students’ skills using a key-elements scale, critical error checklist, and the Ottawa global rating scale (GRS). Baseline knowledge was not different between all four groups (p = 0.65). One week later, knowledge retention was significantly higher for (1) both the mental practice and modeling group than the control group (p = 0.01; p = 0.01, respectively) and (2) the combined mental practice and modeling group compared to all other groups (all ps = 0.01). Regarding skills acquisition, the control group significantly under-performed in comparison to all other groups on the key-events scale (all ps ≤ 0.05), the critical error checklist (all ps ≤ 0.05), and the Ottawa GRS (all ps ≤ 0.05). The combination of mental practice and modeling led to greater improvement on the key events checklist (p = 0.01) compared to either strategy alone. However, the combination of the two strategies did not result in any further learning gains on the two other measures of clinical performance (all ps > 0.05). The effectiveness of enhanced podcasts for knowledge retention and clinical skill acquisition is increased with either mental practice or modeling. The combination of mental practice and modeling had synergistic effects on knowledge retention, but conveyed less clear advantages in its application through clinical skills. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959317039"

They typically see patients alone from the start of their community-based training and are expected to seek timely ad hoc support from their supervisor. Such ad hoc encounters are a mechanism for ensuring patient safety, but also provide an opportunity for learning and teaching. Wenger’s (Communities of practice: learning, meaning, and identity. Cambridge University Press, New York, 1998) social theory of learning (‘communities of practice’) guided a secondary analysis of audio-recordings of ad hoc encounters. Data from one encounter is re-presented as an extended sequence to maintain congruence with the theoretical perspective and enhance vicariousness. An interpretive commentary communicates key features of Wenger’s theory and highlights the researchers’ interpretations. We argue that one encounter can reveal universal understandings of clinical supervision and that the process of naturalistic generalisation allows readers to transfer others’ experiences to their own contexts. The paper raises significant analytic, interpretive, and representational issues. We highlight that report writing is an important, but infrequently discussed, part of research design. We discuss the challenges of supporting the learning and teaching that arises from adopting a socio-cultural lens and argue that such a perspective importantly captures the complex range of issues that work-based practitioners have to grapple with. This offers a challenge to how we research and seek to influence work-based learning and teaching in health care settings. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942021031"

These new medical schools continue the tradition of utilizing mission statements (MSs) to convey goals and ideals. The authors aimed to compare these 17 new medical schools’ MSs with MSs of previously established medical schools in the US and Canada. The MSs of the 17 newest medical schools were processed and analyzed utilizing network text analysis software that assessed centrality of concepts within new medical schools’ MSs. This semantic network data was then compared to existing similar analysis by Grbic et al. (Acad Med 88(6):852–860, 2013. doi:10.1097/ACM.0b013e31828f603d). Four concepts were found to be more central in new medical schools’ MSs as compared to established medical schools’ MSs: “physicians,” “improve,” “diversity,” and “innovation.” Grbic et al. found four concepts to be central to all 132 medical schools “health” or “health_care,” “research,” “education,” and “premier” which are shared top themes of the new medical schools’ MSs. The author’s analysis has demonstrated that new medical schools, as compared to previously established subsets of medical schools, developed both shared and unique language within their MSs. This unique vocabulary reflected a response to a dynamic healthcare environment during the decade of new medical school development. New medical schools may have responded to environmental challenges including a physician shortage while also recognizing the need for a diverse physician workforce prepared to apply innovative strategies to healthcare. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008477514"

In order to improve the quality of clinical learning, factors that influence the provision of feedback are worthy of further investigation. A retrospective data analysis of documented feedback provided by assessors using the mini-CEX in a busy emergency department (ED) was conducted. The assessors comprised emergency physicians (EPs) and trauma surgeons. The trainees were all postgraduate year one (PGY1) residents. The completion rate and word count for each of three feedback components (positive feedback, suggestions for development, and an agreed action plan) were recorded. Other variables included observation time, feedback time, the format used (paper versus computer-based), the seniority of the assessor, the gender of the assessor and the specialty of the assessor. The components of feedback provided by the assessors and the influence of these contextual and demographic factors were also analyzed. During a 26-month study period, 1101 mini-CEX assessments (from 273 PGY1 residents and 67 assessors) were collected. The overall completion rate for the feedback components was 85.3 % (positive feedback), 54.8 % (suggestions for development), and 29.5 % (agreed action plan). In only 22.9 % of the total mini-CEX assessments were all three aspects of feedback completed, and 7.4 % contained no feedback. In the univariate analysis, the mini-CEX format, the seniority of the assessor and the specialty of the assessor were identified as influencing the completion of all three components of feedback. In the multivariate analysis, only the mini-CEX format and the seniority of the assessor were statistically significant. In a subgroup analysis, the feedback-facilitating effect of the computer-based format was uneven across junior and senior EPs. In addition, feedback provision showed a primacy effect: assessors tended to provide only the first or second feedback components in a busy ED setting. In summary, the authors explored the influence of gender, seniority and specialty on paper and computer-based feedback provision during mini-CEX assessments for PGY1 residency training in a busy ED. It was shown that junior assessors were more likely to provide all three aspects of written feedback in the mini-CEX than were senior assessors. The computer-based format facilitated the completion of feedback among EPs. © 2016, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964556597"

By now, most agree that the original claims promising direct translations to teaching and learning were too strong. I argue here that research questions in (health professions) education require multi-methodological approaches, including neuroscience, while carefully weighing what (combination of) approaches are most suitable given a research question. Only through a multi-methodological approach will convergence of evidence emerge, which is so desperately needed for improving teaching and learning in the classroom. However, both researchers and teachers should become aware of the so-called ‘seductive allure’ of EN; that is, the demonstrable physical location and apparent objectivity of the measurements can be interpreted as yielding more powerful evidence and warranting stronger conclusions than, e.g., behavioral experiments, where in fact oftentimes the reverse is the case. I conclude that our tendency as researchers to commit ourselves to one methodological approach and to addressing educational research questions from a single methodological perspective is limiting progress in educational science and in translation to education. © 2016, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994409119"

In this essay we use Beauchamp and Childress’ principles of biomedical ethics as a framework to compare the relationship that clinician educators have with their patients and their learners, and suggest that while we typically apply ethical principles when addressing the needs of our patients, these principles are frequently lacking in our interactions with learners. This dichotomy reflects a person-by-situation interaction that may be partly explained by the expectations of the regulatory bodies that define how clinicians should interact with patients and how educators should interact with learners. The result is that we may fall short in applying respect for autonomy, beneficence/nonmaleficence, and justice when addressing the needs of our learners. Fortunately there are ways in which we can incorporate these ethical principles into our interactions with learners while still adhering to accreditation standards and institutional policy. These include flipped classrooms and simulated learning experiences, incorporating aspects of instructional design that have been shown to improve learning outcomes, providing additional resources to learners with greater needs, and organizing training curricula around entrustable professional activities. Although the consistent application of ethical principles with all learners during all learning experiences is likely unachievable, we can, and should, move towards more ethical treatment of our learners. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84931858157"

This study investigated the effects of fidelity of open patient cases in adjunct to an instructional e-module on students’ cognitive skills and motivation. We set up a three-group randomized post-test-only design: a control group working on an e-module; a cases group, combining the e-module with low-fidelity text-based patient cases, and a game group, combining the e-module with a high-fidelity simulation game with the same cases. Participants completed questionnaires on cognitive load and motivation. After a 4-week study period, blinded assessors rated students’ cognitive emergency care skills in two mannequin-based scenarios. In total 61 students participated and were assessed; 16 control group students, 20 cases students and 25 game students. Learning time was 2 h longer for the cases and game groups than for the control group. Acquired cognitive skills did not differ between groups. The game group experienced higher intrinsic and germane cognitive load than the cases group (p = 0.03 and 0.01) and felt more engaged (p < 0.001). Students did not profit from working on open cases (in adjunct to an e-module), which nonetheless challenged them to study longer. The e-module appeared to be very effective, while the high-fidelity game, although engaging, probably distracted students and impeded learning. Medical educators designing motivating and effective skills training for novices should align case complexity and fidelity with students’ proficiency level. The relation between case-fidelity, motivation and skills development is an important field for further study. © 2015, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84944539460"

Individuals who evaluate potentially stressful situations as challenging rather than threatening may perform better under pressure and be more resilient to stress and burnout. Training programme recruitment processes provide an important opportunity to examine applicants’ reactions to acute stress. In the context of multi-station selection centres for recruitment to anaesthesia training programmes, we investigated the factors influencing candidates’ pre-station challenge/threat evaluations and the extent to which their evaluations predicted subsequent station performance. Candidates evaluated the perceived stress of upcoming stations using a measure of challenge/threat evaluation—the cognitive appraisal ratio (CAR)—and consented to release their demographic details and station scores. Using regression analyses we determined which candidate and station factors predicted variation in the CAR and whether, after accounting for these factors, the CAR predicted candidate performance in the station. The CAR was affected by the nature of the station and candidate gender, but not age, ethnicity, country of training or clinical experience. Candidates perceived stations involving work related tasks as more threatening. After controlling for candidates’ demographic and professional profiles, the CAR significantly predicted station performance: ‘challenge’ evaluations were associated with better performance, though the effect was weak. Our selection centre model can help recruit prospective anaesthetists who are able to rise to the challenge of performing in stressful situations but results do not support the direct use of challenge/threat data for recruitment decisions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939248289"

Specifically, these associations have been explored in complex healthcare professions. A social theory of learning has been proposed as a key component of the utility of peer coaching. Further, within the peer coaching model, assessment has been considered as an important driver. Empirical support for these dimensions of themodel is lacking. To quantify assessment achievements and explore emergent attitudes and beliefs about learning related to a specific peer coachingmodel with integrated assessment. A longitudinal study based in a UK Higher Education Institute recorded assessment achievements and surveyed attitudes and beliefs in consecutive Year 1 undergraduate (physiotherapy) students (n = 560) between 2002 and 2012. A 6% improvement in academic achievement was demonstrated following the introduction of a peer coaching learning model. This was increased by a further 5% following the implementation of an integrated assessment. The improvement related to an overall averaged increase of onemarking band. Students valued the strategy, and themes relating to the importance of social learning emerged from survey data. Peer coaching is an evidence-based teaching and learning strategy which can facilitate learning in complex subject areas.

Faculty who designed this assessment intend for the final score to represent an individual senior medical student’s level of clinical performance. The results are included in each student’s portfolio as one source of evidence of the student’s capability as a practitioner, professional, and scholar. Our purpose in conducting this study was to illustrate how assessment designers who are creating assessments to evaluate clinical performance might develop propositions and then collect and examine various sources of evidence to construct and evaluate a validity argument. The data were from all 154 medical students who were in their final year of study at the University of Dundee Medical School in the 2010–2011 academic year. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on an analysis of senior medical students’ clinical performance while they were taking responsibility for the management of a simulated ward. Using multi-facet Rasch measurement and a generalizability theory approach, we examined various sources of validity evidence that the medical school faculty have gathered for a set of six propositions needed to support their use of scores as measures of students’ clinical ability. Based on our analysis of the evidence, we would conclude that, by and large, the propositions appear to be sound, and the evidence seems to support their proposed score interpretation. Given the body of evidence collected thus far, their intended interpretation seems defensible. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947037993"

In order to introduce an effective and accurate sequential design, we developed a model for designing and evaluating screening OSCEs. Based on two datasets from a 10-station pre-internship OSCE and considering three factors, namely, the number of stations, the criteria for selecting the stations, and the cut-off score, several hypothetical tests were proposed. To investigate their accuracy, the positive predictive value (PPV), the pass rate, and the negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. Also, a “desirable” composite outcome was defined as PPV = 100 %, pass rate ≥50 %, and NPV ≥25 %. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate the effects of independent factors on the occurrence of the desirable outcome. In half of the screening tests no false positive result was detected. Most of the screening OSCEs had acceptable levels of pass rate and NPV. Considering the desirable composite outcome 20 screening OSCEs could have successfully predicted the results of the corresponding full OSCE. The multiple regression analysis indicated significant contributions for the selection criteria (p values = 0.019) and the cut-off score (p values = 0.017). In order to have efficient screening OSCEs with the lowest probability of the error rate, careful selection of stations with high values of discrimination or item total correlation, and use of a relatively stringent cut-off score should be considered. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960109380"

Understanding these values for individuals and across healthcare professions can help improve patient-centred decision-making by individual practitioners and interprofessional teams, respectively. We aimed to identify these values and integrate them into a single framework using Schwartz’s values model. We searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and ERIC databases for articles on personal and professional values of healthcare practitioners and students. We extracted values from included papers and synthesized them into a single framework using Schwartz’s values model. We summarised the framework within the context of healthcare practice. We identified 128 values from 50 included articles from doctors, nurses and allied health professionals. A new framework for the identified values established the following broad healthcare practitioner values, corresponding to Schwartz values (in parentheses): authority (power); capability (achievement); pleasure (hedonism); intellectual stimulation (stimulation); critical-thinking (self-direction); equality (universalism); altruism (benevolence); morality (tradition); professionalism (conformity); safety (security) and spirituality (spirituality). The most prominent values identified were altruism, equality and capability. This review identified a comprehensive set of personal and professional values of healthcare practitioners. We integrated these into a single framework derived from Schwartz’s values model. This framework can be used to assess personal and professional values of healthcare practitioners across professional groups, and can help improve practitioners’ awareness of their values so they can negotiate more patient-centred decisions. A common values framework across professional groups can support shared education strategies on values and help improve interprofessional teamwork and decision-making. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937828901"

While targets supposedly provide incentives for healthcare services, they may unintentionally shape practices of accommodation rather than implementation, deflecting practitioners from providing optimal care. Live work activities were observed for two six months periods in a UK NHS Emergency Department and a Mental Health Ward using video and field notes ethnography, with post hoc unstructured interviews for clarification and verification. Sixty-four practitioners were consented. Data were treated as narratives, analysed thematically and theorised using cultural–historical activity theory. The ideal text of patient-centred team working shaped by top-down, politically inspired targets was disrupted, where targets produced unintended consequences. Bottom-up strategies of making meaning of targets in a local context generated sub-texts of resistance, rationalization, and even duplicity that had paradoxical positive effects in generating collaboration and democratic habits. Throughput pressures generated both cross-team conflicts and intra-team identification. What practitioners actually do to make sense of top-down directives is not the same as the ideal expectation framed by targets. Team members pulled together not because of targets but in spite of them, and as a form of resistance to governance. Targets produce unnecessary stress as team members focus on throughput rather than quality of care. Those governing healthcare must look at the unintended consequences of targets. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84955579676"

A methodological consideration that is often underappreciated is how to operationalize equivalence. This study examined whether a distribution-based approach, based on effect size, can identify an appropriate equivalence threshold for medical education data. Thirty-nine individuals rated program site equivalence on a series of simulated pairwise bar graphs representing one of four measures with which they had prior experience: (1) undergraduate academic achievement, (2) a student experience survey, (3) an Objective Structured Clinical Exam global rating scale, or (4) a licensing exam. Descriptive statistics and repeated measures ANOVA examined the effects on equivalence ratings of (a) the difference between means, (b) variability in scores, and (c) which program site (the larger or smaller) scored higher. The equivalence threshold was defined as the point at which 50 % of participants rated the sites as non-equivalent. Across the four measures, the equivalence thresholds converged to average effect size of Cohen’s d = 0.57 (range of 0.50–0.63). This corresponded to an average mean difference of 10 % (range of 3–13 %). These results are discussed in reference to findings from the health-related quality of life field that has demonstrated that d = 0.50 represents a consistent threshold for perceived change. This study provides preliminary empirically-based guidance for defining an equivalence threshold for researchers and evaluators conducting equivalence tests. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939833260"

In phase three, we screened the written curriculum for diversity content (culture, sex/gender and class) and related the results to learning objectives defined in phase two. We identified learning objectives in three areas of education (medical knowledge and skills, patient–physician communication, and reflexivity). Most diversity content pertained to biomedical knowledge and skills. Limited attention was paid to sociocultural issues as determinants of health and healthcare use. Intersections of culture, sex/gender and class remained mostly unaddressed. The curriculum’s diversity-responsiveness could be improved by an operationalization of diversity that goes beyond biomedical traits of assumed homogeneous social groups. Future efforts to take an intersectionality-based approach to curriculum evaluations should include categories of difference other than culture, sex/gender and class as separate, equally important patient identities or groups. © 2015, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84948144416"

However, studies on the topic have shown contradictory results. This study aimed to further investigate the effect of aging on physicians’ diagnostic accuracy when diagnosing prevalent and less prevalent cases based on clinical vignettes. A mixed design was used to assess the influence of case prevalence (high vs. low) as a within-subjects factor, and age group as a between subjects factor (<30; n = 23, 30–39; n = 19, 40–49; n = 27, >50 years old; n = 19) on the diagnostic accuracy of 65 family physicians and 25 residents. Repeated Measure ANOVA revealed a significant effect of case prevalence (p < .001) and age group (p < .001). Post-hoc analyses revealed that younger physicians showed the best performance. This study did not demonstrate the positive effect of experience in older physicians. In line with previous studies on expertise development, findings of the present study suggest that skills should be actively maintained to assure a high performance level throughout one’s lifespan. If not, performance level could gradually decline with age. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947569797"

Therefore, the aim here is to highlight key issues with using deliberate practice to improve medical team performance, especially given the success of deliberate practice for developing individual expert performance in medicine and other domains. Highlighting these issues will inform the development of training for medical teams. The authors first describe team coordination and its critical role in medical teams. Presented next are the cognitive mechanisms that allow expert performers to accurately interpret the current situation via the creation of an accurate mental “model” of the current situation, known as a situation model. Following this, the authors propose that effective team performance depends at least in part on team members having similar models of the situation, known as a shared situation model. The authors then propose guiding principles for implementing team deliberate practice in medicine and describe how team deliberate practice can be used in an attempt to reduce barriers inherent in medical teams to the development of shared situation models. The paper concludes with considerations of limitations, and future research directions, concerning the implementation of team deliberate practice within medicine. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84974777334"

This study examines the differences between forward and backward instructional strategies’ in terms of efficiency, students’ learning and progression of their mental models of the electronic transport chain in an undergraduate metabolism course (n = 151). Additionally, the participants’ cognitive flexibility, prior knowledge, and mental effort in the learning process are also investigated. The data were analyzed using a series of general linear models to compare the strategies. Although the two strategies did not differ significantly in terms of mental model progression and learning outcomes, both groups’ mental models progressed significantly. Mental effort and prior knowledge were identified as significant predictors of mental model progression. An interaction between instructional strategy and cognitive flexibility revealed that the backward instruction was more efficient than the conventional (forward) strategy for students with lower cognitive flexibility, whereas the conventional instruction was more efficient for students with higher cognitive flexibility. The results are discussed and suggestions for future research on the possible moderating role of cognitive flexibility in the area of health education are presented. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947029103"

We used quantitative Rasch measurement to analyze pre-categorized student comments listed by 385 graduating medical students. We found that students differed little with respect to the number of comments they provided and that their comments indeed form a probabilistic Rasch hierarchy. However, different hierarchies were found across medical departments and faculty. An analysis of these interactions provides valuable, detailed, and quantitative information that can augment qualitative research approaches. In addition, we suggest how the Rasch scaling of student comments can assist researchers in the design and implementation of new faculty evaluation instruments. Finally, the interactions between student and department identified a subset of behaviors that appear to guide and possibly elicit students’ comments. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947039709"

Rater cognition has become an important area of inquiry in the medical education assessment literature generally, and in the OSCE literature specifically, because of concerns about potential compromises of validity. In this study, a novel approach to mixed methods that combined Ordinal Logistic Hierarchical Linear Modeling and cognitive interviews was used to gain insights about what examiners were thinking during an OSCE. This study is based on data from the 2010 to 2014 administrations of the Clinician Assessment for Practice Program OSCE for International Medical Graduates (IMGs) in Nova Scotia. An IMG is a physician trained outside of Canada who was a licensed practitioner in a different country. The quantitative data were examined alongside four follow-up cognitive interviews of examiners conducted after the 2014 administration. The quantitative results show that competencies of (1) Investigation and Management and (2) Counseling were highly predictive of the Overall Global score. These competencies were also described in the cognitive interviews as the most salient parts of OSCE. Examiners also found Communication Skills and Professional Behavior to be relevant but the quantitative results revealed these to be less predictive of the Overall Global score. The interviews also reveal that there is a tacit sequence by which IMGs are expected to proceed in an OSCE, starting with more basic competencies such as History Taking and building up to Investigation Management and Counseling. The combined results confirm that a hidden pattern exists with respect to how examiners rate candidates. This study has potential implications for research into rater cognition, and the design and scoring of practice-ready OSCEs. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84949655793"

The purpose of this study was to investigate students’ reported learning experiences as a result of engagement with an arts-informed project in a health professions’ ethics course. A hermeneutic phenomenological methodological approach was adopted for the study. The data were collected over 5 years, and involved analysis of 234 occupational therapy students’ written reflections on learning. Phenomenological methods were used. Five key themes were identified with respect to students’ reported learning including: becoming aware of values, (re) discovering creativity, coming to value reflection in professional life, deepening self-awareness, and developing capacities to imagine future practices. There appear to be a number of unique ways in which arts-informed approaches can contribute to health professions education including: activating imaginative engagement, fostering interpretive capacity, inspiring transformative understandings, offering new ways of knowing, deepening reflection, and heightening consciousness, while also enriching the inner life of practitioners. Innovative approaches are being used to introduce arts-informed practices in health professions curricula programs.

Much of surgical skills training involve progressive trainee participation in supervised operations where case variability, operating team interaction and environment affect learning, while surgical teachers face the key challenge of ensuring patient safety. Using a theoretical framework of situated learning including cognitive apprenticeship, we explored teachers’ and trainees’ beliefs and values about intra-operative training and reasons for any differences. A qualitative case study method was used where five teacher-trainee pairs participating in an observed teaching operation were separately interviewed about the same operation. Thematic analysis of transcribed interviews and observations was performed with iterative refinement and a reflexive approach was adopted throughout the study. We found that in all cases, teachers and trainees had shared recognition of learning about technical skills whereas they differed in three cases regarding non-technical skills such as surgical reasoning and team management. Factors contributing to teacher and trainee satisfaction with the process were successful trainee completion of operation without need for surgeon take-over, a positive learning environment and learning new things. Teaching–learning behaviours observed and discussed were modeling, coaching and scaffolding, while exploration, reflection and articulation were less common. Our study reveals differing teacher and trainee perspectives of some aspects of intra-operative training and surfaces new reasons other than amount of feedback and autonomy given. Factors contributing to different perspectives include teacher and trainee abilities, values and situational influences.

This creates difficulties for effective feedback, which often depends on a strong relationship of trust between preceptor and student. Building on feedback theories focusing on the relational and dialogic aspects of feedback, this study explored the use of goal-oriented feedback in brief encounters with learners. This study used autoethnography to explore one preceptor’s feedback interactions over an eight-month period both in the ambulatory setting and on the wards. Data included written narrative reflections on feedback interactions with twenty-three learners informed by discussions with colleagues and repeated reading of feedback literature. Thematic and narrative analyses of data were performed iteratively. Data analysis emphasized four recurrent themes. (1) Goal discussions were most effective when initiated early and integrated throughout the learning experience. (2) Both learner and preceptor goals were multiple and varied, and feedback needed to reflect this complexity. (3) Negotiation or co-construction of goals was important when considering the focus of feedback discussions in order to create safer, more effective interactions. (4) Goal oriented interactions offer potential benefits to the learner and preceptor. Goal oriented feedback promotes dialogue as it requires both preceptor and learner to acknowledge and negotiate learning goals throughout their interaction. In doing so, feedback becomes an explicit component of the preceptor–learner relationship. This enhances feedback interactions even in relatively brief encounters, and may begin an early educational alliance that can be elaborated with longer interactions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84969884512"

This review investigates: (1) the effects of PBL on students’ deep and surface approaches to learning, (2) whether and why these effects do differ across (a) the context of the learning environment (single vs. curriculum wide implementation), and (b) study quality. Studies were searched dealing with PBL and students’ approaches to learning. Twenty-one studies were included. The results indicate that PBL does enhance deep learning with a small positive average effect size of.11 and a positive effect in eleven of the 21 studies. Four studies show a decrease in deep learning and six studies show no effect. PBL does not seem to have an effect on surface learning as indicated by a very small average effect size (.08) and eleven studies showing no increase in the surface approach. Six studies demonstrate a decrease and four an increase in surface learning. It is concluded that PBL does seem to enhance deep learning and has little effect on surface learning, although more longitudinal research using high quality measurement instruments is needed to support this conclusion with stronger evidence. Differences cannot be explained by the study quality but a curriculum wide implementation of PBL has a more positive impact on the deep approach (effect size.18) compared to an implementation within a single course (effect size of −.05). PBL is assumed to enhance active learning and students’ intrinsic motivation, which enhances deep learning. A high perceived workload and assessment that is perceived as not rewarding deep learning are assumed to enhance surface learning. © 2015, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946962432"

The purpose of this study was to gather validity evidence regarding response process and internal structure, focusing on inter-rater reliability and generalizability, to determine whether a locally-developed PN scoring rubric and scoring guidelines could yield reproducible PN scores. A randomly selected subsample of historical data (post-encounter PN from 55 of 177 medical students) was rescored by six trained faculty raters in November–December 2014. Inter-rater reliability (% exact agreement and kappa) was calculated for five standardized patient cases administered in a local graduation competency examination. Generalizability studies were conducted to examine the overall reliability. Qualitative data were collected through surveys and a rater-debriefing meeting. The overall inter-rater reliability (weighted kappa) was.79 (Documentation = .63, Differential Diagnosis = .90, Justification = .48, and Workup = .54). The majority of score variance was due to case specificity (13 %) and case-task specificity (31 %), indicating differences in student performance by case and by case-task interactions. Variance associated with raters and its interactions were modest (<5 %). Raters felt that justification was the most difficult task to score and that having case and level-specific scoring guidelines during training was most helpful for calibration. The overall inter-rater reliability indicates high level of confidence in the consistency of note scores. Designs for scoring notes may optimize reliability by balancing the number of raters and cases. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954324996"

User acceptability and engagement is essential to the success of any medical education innovation. To this end, possessing an insight into trainee and trainer perceptions towards WBAs will help identify the major problems, permitting strategies to be introduced to improve WBA implementation. A review of literature was performed to identify studies examining trainee and trainer perceptions towards WBAs. Studies were excluded if non-English or sampling a non-medical/dental population. The identified literature was synthesised for the purpose of this critical narrative review. It is clear that there is widespread negativity towards WBAs in the workplace. This has negatively impacted on the effectiveness of WBA tools as learning aids. This negativity exists in trainees but also to an extent in their trainers. Insight gained from the literature reveals three dominant problems with WBA implementation: poor understanding as to the purpose of WBAs; insufficient time available for undertaking these assessments; and inadequate training of trainers. Approaches to addressing these three problems with WBA implementation are discussed. It is likely that a variety of solutions will be required. The prevalence of negativity towards WBAs is substantial in both trainees and trainers, eroding the effectiveness of learning that is consequent upon them. The educational community must now listen to the concerns being raised by the users and consider the range of strategies being proposed to improve the experiences of trainees, and their trainers. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84929643613"

Identity is a social phenomenon, constructed through participation in everyday activities and an integral part of every learning interaction. In this paper we report from an Australian ethnographic study into how medical students and patients use narrative to construct their identities. The dialogic narrative analysis employed focused on the production of meaning through the use of language devices in a given context, and the juxtaposition of multiple perspectives. Two stories told by students about their participation in patient care-related activities reveal how identities are constructed in this context through depictions of the relationships between medical students, patients and clinical teachers. These students use the rhetorical functions of stories to characterise doctors and patients in certain ways, and position themselves in relation to them. They defend common practices that circumvent valid consent processes, justified by the imperative to maximise students’ participation in patient care-related activities. In doing so, they identify patients as their adversaries, and doctors as allies. Both students are influenced by others’ expectations but one reveals the active nature of identity work, describing subtle acts of resistance. These stories illustrate how practices for securing students’ access to patients can influence students’ emerging identities, with implications for their future disclosure and consent practices. We argue that more collaborative ways of involving medical students in patient care-related activities will be facilitated if students and clinical teachers develop insight into the relational nature of identity work. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84970956434"

Continuity requires handoffs between physicians, but most published studies of educational interventions to improve handoffs have focused primarily on residents, despite interns expected to being proficient. The AAMC core entrustable activities for graduating medical students includes handoffs as a milestone, but no controlled studies with students have assessed the impact of training in handoff skills. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of an educational intervention to improve third-year medical student handoff skills, the durability of learned skills into the fourth year, and the transfer of skills from the simulated setting to the clinical environment. Trained evaluators used standardized patient cases and an observation tool to assess verbal handoff skills immediately post intervention and during the student’s fourth-year acting internship. Students were also observed doing real time sign-outs during their acting internship. Evaluators assessed untrained control students using a standardized case and performing a real-time sign-out. Intervention students mean score demonstrated improvement in handoff skills immediately after the workshop (2.6–3.8; p<0.0001) that persisted into their fourth year acting internship when compared to baseline performance (3.9–3.5; p = 0.06) and to untrained control students (3.5 vs. 2.5; p<0.001, d = 1.2). Intervention students evaluated in the clinical setting also scored higher than control students when assessed doing real-time handoffs (3.8 vs. 3.3; p = 0.032, d = 0.71). These findings should be useful to others considering introducing handoff teaching in the undergraduate medical curriculum in preparation for post-graduate medical training. © The Author(s) 2015.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008512265"

Therefore we designed a survey to identify the determinants of decisions to pursue a biomedical research career based upon the Theory of Planned Behavior and the concept of stereotype threat. From October 2012 through January 2014 electronic surveys were sent to four consecutive Harvard Medical School graduating classes, 1996–1999. Respondents provided demographic information, indicated their current research involvement, and provided retrospective reports of their experiences and attitudes when they were making career choices as they completed medical school. Multivariable ordinal regression was used to identify factors independently associated with current research involvement. Completed questionnaires were received from 358 respondents (response rate 65 %). In unadjusted analyses, variables associated with more extensive research involvement included non-minority status, male gender, lower debt at graduation, strong attitudes toward research at time of graduation, and greater social pressures to pursue research (all P < .001). These associations remained significant in multivariable regression analysis (all P < 0.01). However, an interaction between sex and prior research publications was also detected, indicating that more extensive research involvement during medical school doubled the likelihood of a research career for women (OR 2.53, 95 % CI 1.00–6.40; P = 0.05). Most of the factors predicting research career choice involve factors that are potentially modifiable, suggesting that appropriately designed behavioral interventions may help to expand the size and diversity of the biomedical research community. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964515388"

This study aimed to explore the determinants of success or failure for undergraduate student teams and to define a ‘good group’ through considering three aspects of group success: the task, the individuals, and the team. We employed a mixed methodology, combining demographic data with qualitative observations and task and peer evaluation scores. We determined associations between group dynamic and behaviour, demographic composition, member personalities and attitudes towards one another, and task success. We also employed a cluster analysis to create a model outlining the attributes of a good small group learning team in veterinary education. This model highlights that student groups differ in measures of their effectiveness as teams, independent of their task performance. On the basis of this, we suggest that groups who achieve high marks in tasks cannot be assumed to have acquired team working skills, and therefore if these are important as a learning outcome, they must be assessed directly alongside the task output. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964089183"

While three dimensional (3D) visualization technologies are gaining ground due to their ever-increasing realism, reports investigating physical models as a low-cost 3D traditional method are still the subject of considerable interest. The aim of this meta-analysis is to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of such models based on comparative studies. Eight studies (7 randomized trials; 1 quasi-experimental) including 16 comparison arms and 820 learners met the inclusion criteria. Primary outcomes were defined as factual, spatial and overall percentage scores. The meta-analytical results are: educational methods using physical models yielded significantly better results when compared to all other educational methods for the overall knowledge outcome (p < 0.001) and for spatial knowledge acquisition (p < 0.001). Significantly better results were also found with regard to the long-retention knowledge outcome (p < 0.01). No significance was found for the factual knowledge acquisition outcome. The evidence in the present systematic review was found to have high internal validity and at least an acceptable strength. In conclusion, physical anatomical models offer a promising tool for teaching gross anatomy in 3D representation due to their easy accessibility and educational effectiveness.

Despite this, curriculum designers commonly assume them to be simple to learn and perform. This research used mixed methods to explore how undergraduate medical students learn to prescribe in the ‘real world’. It was informed by cognitive psychology, sociocultural theory, and systems thinking. We found that learning to prescribe occurs as a dynamic series of socially negotiated interactions within and between individuals, communities and environments. As well as a thematic analysis, we developed a framework of three conceptual spaces in which learning opportunities for prescribing occur. This illustrates a complex systems view of prescribing education and defines three major system components: the “social space”, where the environmental conditions influence or bring about a learning experience; the “process space”, describing what happens during the learning experience; and the intra-personal “cognitive space”, where the learner may develop aspects of prescribing expertise. This conceptualisation broadens the scope of inquiry of prescribing education research by highlighting the complex interplay between individual and social dimensions of learning. This perspective is also likely to be relevant to students’ learning of other clinical competencies. © 2015, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947036609"

We prospectively explored students’ perceptions of their upcoming transition to clerkship and their future professional selves. In 2013, 160/165 end-of-second-year medical students wrote narrative reflections and 79/165 completed a questionnaire on their perceptions of their upcoming transition to clerkship. Narratives were separately analyzed by four authors and then discussed to identify a final thematic framework using parsimonious category construction.We identified two overarching themes: (1) “Looking back”: experiences which had helped students feel prepared for clerkship with subthemes focused on of patient care, shadowing, classroom teaching and the pre-clerkship years as foundational knowledge, (2) “Looking forward”: anticipating the clerkship experience and the journey of becoming a physician with subthemes focused on death and dying, hierarchy, work-life balance, interactions with patients, concerns about competency and career choice. Questionnaire data revealed incongruities around expectations of minimal exposure to death and dying, little need for independent study and limited direct patient responsibility.Weconfirmed that internal transformations are happening in contemplative time even before clerkship. By prospectively exploring pre-clerkship students’ perceptions of the transition to clerkship training we identified expectations and misconceptions that could be addressed with future curricular interventions. While students are aware of and anticipating their learning needs it is not as clear that they realise howmuch their future learning will depend on their own inner resources. We suggest that more attention be paid to professional identity formation and the development of the physician as a person during these critical transitions. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008474506"

Although engaging in both personal and professional learning and development activities is recognized fundamental for lifelong professional competence, research on medical professionals’ entrance into practice is scarce. This research aims to contribute to the framework of medical professionals’ informal learning and outlines the results of an exploratory study on the nature of learning in daily practice beyond postgraduate training. Eleven newly qualified physicians from different specialized backgrounds participated in a phenomenographic study, using a critical incident method and a grounded theory approach. Results demonstrated that learning in the workplace is, to a large extent, informal and associated with a variety of learning experiences. Analysis shows that experiences related to diagnostics and treatments are important sources for learning. Furthermore, incidents related to communication, changing roles, policy and organization offer learning opportunities, and therefore categorized as learning experiences. A broad range of learning activities are identified in dealing with these learning experiences. More specifically, actively engaging in actions and interactions, especially with colleagues of the same specialty, are the most mentioned. Observing others, consulting written sources, and recognizing uncertainties, are also referred to as learning activities. In the study, interaction, solely or combined with other learning activities, are deemed as very important by specialists in the initial entrance into practice. These insights can be used to develop workplace structures to support the entrance into practice following postgraduate training. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84944562131"

Observational learning could be particularly important in the medical field considering that patients’ safety prevails over students’ training. The mechanism of observational learning is based on the mirror neuron system, originally discovered in the monkey pre-motor cortex. Today we know that humans have a similar system, and its role is to understand and reproduce the observed actions of others. Many studies conclude that humans are able to plan and to make movements based on visual information by mapping a representation of observed actions, especially when the motor system is committed to do it. Moreover most researchers considered observational learning effective for complex skills, such as medical procedures. Additionally, observational learning could play a relevant role during anesthesia training since the learner works in pairs most of the time (dyad practice). Some teaching approaches should be taken into consideration: an implicit engagement of the observer motor system is required, immediate feedback seems to have an important effect, and a combination of observational and physical practice could be better than physical practice alone. In an environment where effectiveness and efficacy are essential, observational learning seems to fit well. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84945252048"

How the differing concerns of patient care and student education are balanced in situ remains largely unknown and undefined. This video ethnographic study explores patient involvement during a largely student-centric activity: ‘feedback sequences’ where students learn clinical and practical skills. Drawing on a data subset from a multi-site study, we used Conversation Analysis to investigate verbal and non-verbal interactional practices to examine patients’ inclusion and exclusion from teaching activities across 25 BTEs in General Practice and General Surgery and Medicine with 50 participants. Through analysis, we identified two representations of the patient: the patient embodied (where patients are actively involved) and the patient as-a-body (when they are used primarily as a prop for learning). Overall, patients were excluded more during physical examination than talk-based activities. Exclusion occurred through physical positioning of doctor–patient–student, and through doctors and students talking about, rather than to, patients using medical jargon and online commentaries. Patients’ exclusion was visibly noticeable through eye gaze: patients’ middle-distance gaze coincided with medical terminology or complex wording. Inclusory activities maintained the patient embodied during teaching activities through doctors’ skilful embedding of teaching within their care: including vocalising clinical reasoning processes through students, providing patients with a ‘warrant to listen’, allocating turns-at-talk for them and eye-contact. This study uniquely demonstrates the visible nature patient exclusion, providing firm evidence of how this affects patient empowerment and engagement within educational activities for tomorrow’s doctors. © 2016, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84973097791"

More precisely, during the clinical reasoning process stored information within long-term memory is brought into WM to facilitate the internal deliberation that affords a clinician the ability to reason through a case. In the present study, we examined the relationship between clinical reasoning and WM while participants read clinical cases with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). More specifically, we examined the impact of clinical case difficulty (easy, hard) and clinician level of expertise (2nd year medical students, senior gastroenterologists) on neural activity within regions of cortex associated with WM (i.e., the prefrontal cortex) during the reasoning process. fMRI was used to scan ten second-year medical students and ten practicing gastroenterologists while they reasoned through sixteen clinical cases [eight straight forward (easy) and eight complex (hard)] during a single 1-h scanning session. Within-group analyses contrasted the easy and hard cases which were then subsequently utilized for a between-group analysis to examine effects of expertise (novice > expert, expert > novice). Reading clinical cases evoked multiple neural activations in occipital, prefrontal, parietal, and temporal cortical regions in both groups. Importantly, increased activation in the prefrontal cortex in novices for both easy and hard clinical cases suggests novices utilize WM more so than experts during clinical reasoning. We found that clinician level of expertise elicited differential activation of regions of the human prefrontal cortex associated with WM during clinical reasoning. This suggests there is an important relationship between clinical reasoning and human WM. As such, we suggest future models of clinical reasoning take into account that the use of WM is not consistent throughout all clinical reasoning tasks, and that memory structure may be utilized differently based on level of expertise. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946103671"

Multivariable regression (logistic for binary outcomes and linear for continuous outcomes) was used to analyze factors associated with outcome measures. The MCAT score and undergraduate GPA (uGPA) were treated as independent variables; medical and graduate school grades, time-to-PhD defense, USMLE scores, publication number, and career outcome were dependent variables. For cohort 1 (1963–1977), MCAT score was not associated with any assessed outcome, although uGPA was associated with medical school preclinical GPA and graduate school GPA (gsGPA). For cohort 2 (1978–1991), MCAT score was associated with USMLE Step II score and inverselycorrelated with publication number, and uGPA was associated with preclinical GPA (mspGPA) and clinical GPA (mscGPA). For cohort 3 (1992–2003), the MCAT score was associated with mscGPA, and uGPA was associated with gsGPA.

Scholars in vocational training and nursing disagree whether emotion-related skills could be conceptualized and assessed as a professional competence. Studies on emotion work and empathy regularly neglect the multidimensionality of these phenomena and their relation to the care process, and are rarely conclusive with respect to nursing behavior in practice. To test the status of emotion-related skills as a facet of client-directed geriatric nursing competence, 402 final-year nursing students from 24 German schools responded to a 62-item computer-based test. 14 items were developed to represent emotion-related affordances. Multi-dimensional IRT modeling was employed to assess a potential subdomain structure. Emotion-related test items did not form a separate subdomain, and were found to be discriminating across the whole competence continuum. Tasks concerning emotion work and empathy are reliable indicators for various levels of client-directed nursing competence. Claims for a distinct emotion-related competence in geriatric nursing, however, appear excessive with a process-oriented perspective. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008474290"

Yet in this paper, the difficulties encountered with the original notion of situated learning once it is applied to contemporary Danish nursing education are introduced. One issue that has arisen is the analytical requirement for an educational program to be a homogeneous, singular, and social phenomenon thereby discounting the varied and different sites and materialities found within nursing education. By using the materiality of the hospital bed as an empirical example of the way materiality also shapes practices, an alternative understanding of situated participation can emerge. This approach allows different sites and materialities to be conceptualized as equally genuine parts of the situated leaning framework. I suggest the notion of multi-configured learning, which captures the heterogeneity and materiality encountered during ethnographic fieldwork at a Danish nursing school. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84957576800"

Primary care is an area of practice that offers a promising option for interprofessional student learning. In this study, we investigated what and how students from differing professions learn together. Our findings inform the design of future interprofessional education initiatives. Using activity theory, we conducted an ethnographic investigation of interprofessional education in primary care. During a 5 months period, we observed 14 clinic sessions involving mixed discipline student teams who interviewed people with chronic disease. Teams were comprised of senior medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, pharmacy and physiotherapy entry level students. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with seven clinical educators. Data were analysed to ascertain the objectives, tools, rules and division of labour. Two integrated activity systems were identified: (1) student teams gathering information to determine patients’ health care needs and (2) patients either as health consumers or student educators. Unwritten rules regarding ‘shared contribution’, ‘patient as key information source’ and ‘time constraints’ were identified. Both the significance of software literacy on team leadership, and a pre-determined structure of enquiry, highlighted the importance of careful consideration of the tools used in interprofessional education, and the way they can influence practice. The systems of practice identified provide evidence of differing priorities and values, and multiple perspectives of how to manage health. The work reinforced the value of the patients’ voice in clinical and education processes. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954470001"

This study built on earlier research to explore rater cognition, capturing factors that contribute to assessor decision making about students’ competency. The aims were to determine the source of variation in the examination process and document the factors impacting on examiner judgment. Examiner judgement was explored from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective. Twenty-three examiners viewed three video encounters of student performance on an OSCE. Once rated, analysis of variance was performed to determine where the variance was attributed. A semi-structured interview drew out the examiners reasoning behind their ratings. Results highlighted variability of the process of observation, judgement and rating, with each examiner viewing student performance from different lenses. However, at a global level, analysis of variance indicated that the examiner had a minimal impact on the variance, with the majority of variance explained by the student performance on task. One anomaly noted was in the assessment of technical competency, whereby the examiner had a large impact on the rating, linked to assessing according to curriculum content. The thought processes behind judgement were diverse and if the qualitative results had been used in isolation, may have led to the researchers drawing conclusions that the examined performances would have yielded widely different ratings. However, as a cohort, the examiners were able to distinguish good and poor levels of competency with the majority of student competency linked to the varying ability of the student. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84955277072"

The marker indexes a comprehensive model of visual processing, and if it is apparent in physicians, it could be used to investigate the development and training of their visual expertise. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a neural marker of visual expertise—the enhanced N170 event-related potential—is apparent in the EEGs of physicians as they interpret diagnostic images. We conducted a controlled trial with 10 cardiologists and 9 pulmonologists. Each participant completed 520 trials of a standard visual processing task involving the rapid evaluation of EKGs and CXRs-indicating-lung-disease. Ostensibly, each participant is expert with one type of image and competent with the other. We collected behavioral data on the participants’ expertise with EKGs and CXRs and electrophysiological data on the magnitude, latency, and scalp location of their N170 ERPs as they interpreted the two types of images. Cardiologists demonstrated significantly more expertise with EKGs than CXRs, and this was reflected in an increased amplitude of their N170 ERPs while reading EKGs compared to CXRs. Pulmonologists demonstrated equal expertise with both types of images, and this was reflected in equal N170 ERP amplitudes for EKGs and CXRs. The results suggest provisionally that visual expertise has a similar substrate in medical practice as it does in other domains that have been studied extensively. This provides support for applying a sophisticated body of literature to questions about training and assessment of visual expertise among physicians. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84988736494"

At Radboud University Medical Center, 2010 was the first year we selected applicants. We designed a procedure based on tasks mimicking the reality of early medical school. Applicants took an online course followed by an on-site exam, resembling courses and exams in early medical school. Based on the exam scores, applicants were selected or rejected. The aim of our study is to determine whether curriculum sample selection explains performance in medical school and is preferable compared to selection based on performance in secondary school. We gathered data on the performance of students of three consecutive cohorts (2010–2012, N = 954). We compared medical school performance (course credits and grade points) of selected students to the three groups admitted in other ways, especially lottery admissions. In regression analyses, we controlled for out of context cognitive performance by adjusting for pu-GPA. Selection-admitted students outperformed lottery-admitted students on most outcome measures, unadjusted as well as adjusted for pu-GPA (p ≤ 0.05). They had higher grade points than non-selected lottery students, both unadjusted and adjusted for pu-GPA (p ≤ 0.025). Adjusted for pu-GPA, selection-admitted students and high-pu-GPA students performed equally. We recommend this selection procedure as it adds to secondary school cognitive performance for the general population of students, is efficient for large numbers of applicants and not labour-intensive. © 2016, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964290470"

The aim of this study was to examine the validity of early diagnosis of struggling in medical school based on informal teacher judgements of in-class behavior. The study design was a prospective cohort study and the outcomes/truth criteria were anatomy failure and medical school drop out. Six weeks into an anatomy course, student tutors attempted to identify medical students, who they reckoned would fail the anatomy course or drop out, based on their everyday experiences with students in a large group educational setting. In addition, they were asked to describe the indicators of struggling they observed. Sixteen student tutors evaluated 429 medical students for signs of struggling. By week six, the student tutors were able to detect approximately 1/4–1/3 of the students who eventually failed or dropped out, and for ¾ of the strugglers they identified, they were correct in their judgments. Informal student tutor’s judgements showed incremental validity for both outcomes when controlling for grades obtained in preceeding exams. Lack of participation, lack of commitment, poor academic performance, poor social interactions and general signs of distress were the main indicators of struggling identified. Teachers’ informal judgements of in-class behavior may be an untapped source of information in the early identification of struggling medical students with added value above and beyond formal testing. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962273253"

Preconstructed concept maps are recommended for this purpose. They are mainly constructed by experts. However, concept maps constructed by residents are hypothesized to be less complex, to reveal more tacit basic science concepts and these basic science concepts are expected to be used for the organization of the maps. These hypotheses are derived from studies about knowledge development of individuals. However, integrated curricula require a high degree of cooperation between clinicians and basic scientists. This study examined whether there are consistent variations regarding the articulation of integration when groups of experienced clinicians and basic scientists and groups of residents and basic scientists-in-training construct concept maps. Seven groups of three clinicians and basic scientists on experienced level and seven such groups on resident level constructed concept maps illuminating clinical problems. They were guided by instructions that focused them on articulation of integration. The concept maps were analysed by features that described integration. Descriptive statistics showed consistent variations between the two expertise levels. The concept maps of the resident groups exceeded those of the experienced groups in articulated integration. First, they used significantly more links between clinical and basic science concepts. Second, these links connected basic science concepts with a greater variety of clinical concepts than the experienced groups. Third, although residents did not use significantly more basic science concepts, they used them significantly more frequent to organize the clinical concepts. The conclusion was drawn that not all hypotheses could be confirmed and that the resident concept maps were more elaborate than expected. This article discusses the implications for the role that residents and basic scientists-in-training might play in the construction of preconstructed concept maps and the development of integrated curricula. © 2015, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983035734"

Therefore, an important aim of medical schools is to educate future medical doctors to become self-regulated, lifelong learners. However, it is unclear if medical students become better self-regulated learners during the pre-clinical stage of medical school, and whether students develop self-regulated learning skills differently, dependent on the educational approach of their medical school. In a cross-sectional design, we investigated the development of 384 medical students’ self-regulated learning skills with the use of the Self-Regulation of Learning Self-Report Scale. Next, we compared this development in students who enrolled in two distinct medical curricula: a problem-based curriculum and a lectured-based curriculum. Analysis showed that more skills decreased than increased during the pre-clinical stage of medical school, and that the difference between the curricula was mainly caused by a decrease in the skill evaluation in the lecture-based curriculum. These findings seem to suggest that, irrespective of the curriculum, self-regulated learning skills do not develop during medical school. © The Author(s) 2015.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008440948"

Learners in different sociopolitical settings can join together in developing critical consciousness—awareness of power and privilege dynamics in society—by means of communication technology. The aim of this research was to define strengths and limitations of existing cross-cultural discussions in generating critical consciousness. The setting was the FAIMER international fellowship program for mid-career interdisciplinary health faculty, whose goal is to foster global advancement of health professions education. Fellows take part in participant-led, online, written, task-focused discussions on topics like professionalism, community health, and leadership. We reflexively identified text that brought sociopolitical topics into the online environment during the years 2011 and 2012 and used a discourse analysis toolset to make our content analysis relevant to critical consciousness. While references to participants’ cultures and backgrounds were infrequent, narratives of political-, gender-, religion-, and other culture-related topics did emerge. When participants gave accounts of their experiences and exchanged cross-cultural stories, they were more likely to develop ad hoc networks to support one another in facing those issues than explore issues relating to the development of critical consciousness. We suggest that cross-cultural discussions need to be facilitated actively to transform learners’ frames of reference, create critical consciousness, and develop cultural competence. Further research is needed into how to provide a safe environment for such learning and provide faculty development for the skills needed to facilitate these exchanges. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939824759"

In medical education, multi-source feedback (MSF) is utilized to assess core competencies, including the professionalism. However, little attention has been paid to the measurement invariance of assessment instruments; that is, whether an instrument holds the same meaning across different rater groups. To examine the measurement invariance of the National Taiwan University professionalism MSF (NTU P-MSF) in order to determine whether medical students’ self-rating can be compared to their peers’ rating. An eight-factor model was specified for confirmatory factor analysis to examine the construct validity of the NTU P-MSF. Cronbach’s alpha was computed for the items of each domain to evaluate internal consistent reliability. The same eight-factor model was used for multi-group confirmatory factor analyses. Four hierarchical models were specified to test configural (i.e., identical factor–item relationship), metric (i.e., identical factor loadings), scalar (i.e., identical intercepts), and error variance across self-rating and peer rating groups. One hundred and twenty second-year medical students from weekly discussion groups conducted as part of a medical professionalism course agreed to use the NTU P-MSF to assess themselves or their discussion group peers. NTU P-MSF assessment scores were a good fit for the eight-factor model among self group and peer group. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficients of students’ NTU P-MSF scores and peers’ scores ranged from 0.76 to 0.89 and 0.84 to 0.91, respectively indicating that the NTU P-MSF scores also have good internal consistent reliability between both groups. In addition, same factor structure and similar factor loadings and intercepts of NTU P-MSF scores between both groups indicate that NTU P-MSF scores had configural, metric, and scalar invariance. Thus, students’ self-assessments and peer assessments can be compared in terms of the constructs of NTU P-MSF scores, change in NTU P-MSF scores, and its factor scores. This study demonstrates how to investigate the measurement invariance of a professionalism MSF and contributes to the discussion on self- and peer assessment in medical education. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942068042"

One of the factors that students take into account is a specialty’s prestige which hinges partly on its focus on technique rather than whole person. We examine the potential of a psychological framework, social dominance theory, to explain why some students, and not others, are drawn to more prestigious, technique-oriented specialties, based on their desire for hierarchy. We conducted a cross-sectional study among medical students at Institution X (N = 359). We examined the link between medical students’ characteristics i.e. social dominance orientation (SDO), gender, age, and their career intention. We also examined level of medical students’ SDO at different stages of the curriculum. SDO scores were significantly associated with technique-oriented career intentions (OR 1.56; 95% CI [1.18, 2.06]; p = 0.001). The effect was independent of gender. Medical students’ SDO scores were significantly higher in later stages of the medical curriculum (F = 6.79; p = 0. 001). SDO is a significant predictor of medical students’ career intention. SDO scores are higher in students during the clinical phase of the curriculum. Medical socialization, involving the internalization of implicit and explicit norms, particularly in hospital settings, is likely to underpin our findings. This theory illuminates consistent findings in the literature on specialty prestige and the influence of medical school on career choice. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008512401"

Understanding the nature of this decline is necessary for addressing it. The Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) is used to measure medical students’ clinical empathy attitudes. One recent study described a 3-factor model of the JSE. This model was found in responses from matriculating medical students, but little is known about how the factor structure of the scale changes during clinical training. The Learning Environment Study is a longitudinal prospective study of two cohorts from 28 medical schools. At matriculation and at the end of each subsequent year, students self-reported clinical empathy attitudes using the JSE. Data from 4,797 students were randomly partitioned for exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses using responses from preclinical and clinical years of medical school. Five models were compared for confirmatory factor analysis: two null models for control, the recent 3-factor model, and the two models resulting from the EFAs of preclinical and clinical year responses. Preclinical year responses yielded a 3-factor model similar to the recent 3-factor model. Clinical year responses yielded a 4-factor model (“feelings,” “importance,” “ease,” and “metacognitive effort”) suggesting changes in the structure of clinical empathy attitudes over time. Metacognitive effort showed the largest decline over time. The model is a better fit for both preclinical and clinical responses and may provide more insight into medical students’ clinical empathy attitudes than other models. The emergence of metacognitive effort in the clinical years suggests empathy may become more nuanced for students after clinical exposure and may account for much of the observed decline in clinical empathy attitudes. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008473991"

The use of quantitative measurement using psychometric instruments such as response scales is thought to emphasize a narrow range of relevant learner skills and competencies. Recent reviews and commentaries suggest that a paradigm shift might be presently underway. We argue for caution, in that the psychometrics approach and the quantitative account of competencies that it reflects is based on a rich discussion regarding measurement and scaling that led to the establishment of this paradigm. Rather than reflecting a homogeneous discipline focused on core competencies devoid of consideration of context, the psychometric community has a history of discourse and debate within the field, with an acknowledgement that the techniques and instruments developed within psychometrics are heuristics that must be used pragmatically. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939839611"

Recent evidence using Implicit Association Tests suggests that these disparities in outcome may in part be due to social biases that are primarily unconscious. In some individuals the activation of these biases may be also facilitated by the high levels of cognitive load associated with clinical practice. However, a range of measures, such as counter-stereotypical stimuli and targeted experience with minority groups, have been identified as possible solutions in other fields and may be adapted for use within healthcare settings. We suggest that social bias should not be seen exclusively as a problem of conscious attitudes which need to be addressed through increased awareness. Instead the delivery of bias free healthcare should become a habit, developed through a continuous process of practice, feedback and reflection. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947026944"

We used Ackerman’s theory of ability determinants of skill acquisition to explain the influence of spatial visualization and manual dexterity on the task performance of dental students in two consecutive preclinical technique courses. We measured spatial and manual abilities of applicants to Hamburg Dental School by means of a multiple choice test on Technical Aptitude and a wire-bending test, respectively. Preclinical dental technique tasks were categorized as consistent-simple and inconsistent-complex based on their contents. For analysis, we used robust regression to circumvent typical limitations in dental studies like small sample size and non-normal residual distributions. We found that manual, but not spatial ability exhibited a moderate influence on the performance in consistent-simple tasks during dental skill acquisition in preclinical dentistry. Both abilities revealed a moderate relation with the performance in inconsistent-complex tasks. These findings support the hypotheses which we had postulated on the basis of Ackerman’s work. Therefore, spatial as well as manual ability are required for the acquisition of dental skills in preclinical technique courses. These results support the view that both abilities should be addressed in dental admission procedures in addition to cognitive measures. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84985914243"

In this article we use students’ reflective essays to identify key features of the learning environment that contributed to positive and transformative learning experiences. We explore the relationships between these features, the students’ sense of safety in the learning environment (LE), the resulting learning challenge with which they could cope and their positive reports of the experience itself. Our students worked in a unique simulation of General Practice, the Safe and Effective Clinical Outcomes clinic, where they consistently reported positive experiences of learning. We analysed 77 essays from 2011 and 2012 using an immersion/crystallisation framework. Half of the students referred to the safety of the learning environment spontaneously. Students described deep learning experiences in their simulated consultations. Students valued features of the LE which contributed to a psychologically safe environment. Together with the provision of constructive support and immediate, individualised feedback this feeling of safety assisted students to find their own way through clinical dilemmas. These factors combine to make students feel relaxed and able to take on challenges that otherwise would have been overwhelming. Errors became learning opportunities and students could practice purposefully. We draw on literature from medical education, educational psychology and sociology to interpret our findings. Our results demonstrate relationships between safe learning environments, learning challenge and powerful learning experiences, justifying close attention to the construction of learning environments to promote student learning, confidence and motivation. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008445031"

This study examined reliability and validity for an instrument assessing PBL performance in four domains: Problem Solving, Use of Information, Group Process, and Professionalism. Two cohorts of medical students (N = 310) participated in the study, with 2 years of PBL evaluation data extracted from archive rated by a total of 158 faculty raters. Analyses based on generalizability theory were conducted for reliability examination. Validity was examined through following the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing to evaluate content validity, response processes, construct validity, predictive validity, and the relationship to the variable of training. For construct validity, correlations of PBL scores with six other outcome measures were examined, including Medical College Admission Test, United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1, National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Comprehensive Basic Science Examination, NBME Comprehensive Clinical Science Examination, Clinical Performance Examination, and USMLE Step 2 Clinical Knowledge. Predictive validity was examined by using PBL scores to predict five medical school outcomes. The highest percentage of PBL total score variance was associated with students (60 %), indicating students in the study differed in their PBL performance. The generalizability and dependability coefficients were moderately high (Ep2 = .68, ϕ = .60), showing the instrument is reliable for ranking students and identifying competent PBL performers. The patterns of correlations between PBL domain scores and the outcome measures partially support construct validity. PBL performance ratings as a whole significantly (p < .01) predicted all the major medical school achievements.

This paper presents a structured search and thematic review of the research evidence relating to values-based recruitment within healthcare. Several different databases, journals and government reports were searched to retrieve studies relating to values-based recruitment published between 1998 and 2013, both in healthcare settings and other occupational contexts. There is limited published research related to values-based recruitment directly, so the available theoretical context of values is explored alongside an analysis of the impact of value congruence. The implications for the design of selection methods to measure values is explored beyond the scope of the initial literature search. Research suggests some selection methods may be appropriate for values-based recruitment, such as situational judgment tests (SJTs), structured interviews and multiple-mini interviews (MMIs). Personality tests were also identified as having the potential to compliment other methods (e.g. structured interviews), as part of a values-based recruitment agenda. Methods including personal statements, references and unstructured/‘traditional’ interviews were identified as inappropriate for values-based recruitment. Practical implications are discussed in the context of values-based recruitment in the healthcare context. Theoretical implications of our findings imply that prosocial implicit trait policies, which could be measured by selection tools such as SJTs and MMIs, may be linked to individuals’ values via the behaviours individuals consider to be effective in given situations. Further research is required to state this conclusively however, and methods for values-based recruitment represent an exciting and relatively unchartered territory for further research. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84921867342"

As a result there has been growing interest in situating teacher development initiatives in clinical workplaces. The relationship between becoming a teacher and clinical workplace contexts is under theorised. In response, this qualitative research set out to explore how clinicians become teachers in relation to clinical communities and institutions. Using communities of practice (CoP) as a conceptual framework this research employed the sensitising concepts of regimes of competence and vertical (managerial) and horizontal (professional) planes of accountability to elucidate structural influences on teacher development. Fourteen hospital physicians completed developmental timelines and underwent semi-structured interviews, exploring their development as teachers. Despite having very different developmental pathways, participants’ descriptions of their teacher identities and practice that were remarkably congruent. Two types of CoP occupied the horizontal plane of accountability i.e. clinical teams (Firms) and communities of junior doctors (Fraternities). Participants reproduced teacher identities and practice that were congruent with CoPs’ regimes of competence in order to gain recognition and legitimacy. Participants also constructed their teacher identities in relation to institutions in the vertical plane of accountability (i.e. hospitals and medical schools). Institutions that valued teaching supported the development of teacher identities along institutionally defined lines. Where teaching was less valued, clinicians adapted their teacher identities and practices to suit institutional norms. Becoming a clinical educator entails continually negotiating one’s identity and practice between two potentially conflicting planes of accountability. Clinical CoPs are largely conservative and reproductive of teaching practice whereas accountability to institutions is potentially disruptive of teacher identity and practice. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960075003"

Very limited qualitative research exists, however, on how attitudes towards vaccination develop among healthcare professionals in-training. We explored perspective development among three groups of students: medical, chiropractic, and naturopathic. We conducted focus group sessions with participants from each year of study at three different healthcare training programs in Ontario, Canada. Semi-structured and open-ended questions were used to elicit dynamic interaction among participants and explore how they constructed their attitudes toward vaccination at the beginning and part way through their professional training. Analyses of verbatim transcripts of audiotaped interviews were conducted both inductively and deductively using questions structured by existing literature on learning, professional socialization and interprofessional relations. We found five major themes and each theme was illustrated with representative quotes. Numerous unexpected insights emerged within these themes, including students’ general open-mindedness towards pediatric vaccination at the beginning of their training; the powerful influence of both formal education and informal socialization; uncritical acceptance of the vaccination views of senior or respected professionals; students’ preference for multiple perspectives rather than one-sided, didactic instruction; the absence of explicit socio-cultural tensions among professions; and how divergences among professional students’ perspectives result from differing emphases with respect to lifestyle, individual choice, public health and epidemiological factors—rather than disagreement concerning the biomedical evidence. This last finding implies that their different perspectives on pediatric vaccination may be complementary rather than irreconcilable. Our findings should be considered by developers of professional and interprofessional educational curricula and public health officials formulating policy on pediatric vaccination. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947046783"

In addition to its potential for redressing physician maldistribution, DME has conferred multiple unexpected educational benefits. In several countries, its recent rise has occurred around the boundaries of traditional medical education practices. Canada has been no exception, with DME proliferating against a backdrop of its longstanding central node, the clinical teaching unit (CTU). The CTU first appeared just over 50 years ago with its position in Canadian health care largely taken-for-granted. Given the increasing prominence of DME, however, it is timely to reconsider what the place of tertiary centre-based practices such as the CTU might be in shifting medical education systems. From a genealogical perspective, it becomes clear that the CTU did not just “happen”. Rather, its creation was made possible by multiple interrelated cultural, social, and political changes in Canadian society that, while subtle, are powerfully influential. Making them visible offers a better opportunity to harmonize the benefits of longstanding entities such as the CTU with novel practices such as DME. In so doing, the medical education field may sidestep the pitfalls of investing significant resources that may only produce superficial changes while unwittingly obstructing deeper transformations and improvements. Although this work is refracted through a Canadian prism, reconceptualizing the overall design of medical education systems to take advantage of both tradition and innovation is a persistent challenge across the international spectrum, resistant to tests of time and constraints of context. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928663184"

Box 616, Maastricht, 6200 MD, Netherlands","To prevent radiologists from overlooking lesions, radiology textbooks recommend “systematic viewing,” a technique whereby anatomical areas are inspected in a fixed order. This would ensure complete inspection (full coverage) of the image and, in turn, improve diagnostic performance. To test this assumption, two experiments were performed. Both experiments investigated the relationship between systematic viewing, coverage, and diagnostic performance. Additionally, the first investigated whether systematic viewing increases with expertise; the second investigated whether novices benefit from full-coverage or systematic viewing training. In Experiment 1, 11 students, ten residents, and nine radiologists inspected five chest radiographs. Experiment 2 had 75 students undergo a training in either systematic, full-coverage (without being systematic) or nonsystematic viewing. Eye movements and diagnostic performance were measured throughout both experiments. In Experiment 1, no significant correlations were found between systematic viewing and coverage, r = -.10, p =.62, and coverage and performance, r = -.06, p =.74. Experts were significantly more systematic than students F2,25 = 4.35, p =.02. In Experiment 2, significant correlations were found between systematic viewing and coverage, r = -.35, p<.01, but not between coverage and performance, r =.13, p =.31. Participants in the full-coverage training performed worse compared with both other groups, which did not differ between them, F2,71 = 3.95, p =.02. In conclusion, the data question the assumption that systematic viewing leads to increased coverage, and, consequently, to improved performance. Experts inspected cases more systematically, but students did not benefit from systematic viewing training. © The Author(s) 2015.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008477428"

However, little is known about speaking up of clinical teachers in postgraduate medical training. In order to determine how clinical teachers demonstrate speaking up in formal teaching team meetings and what factors influence this, the authors carried out an exploratory study based on ethnographic principles. The authors selected 12 teaching teams and observed, audio recorded and analysed the data. Subsequently, during an interview, the program directors reflected on speaking up of those clinical teachers present during the meeting. Finally, the authors analysed iteratively all data, using a template analysis, based on Edmondson’s behaviours of speaking up. The study was conducted from October 2013 to July 2014 and ten teams participated. During the teaching team meetings, the clinical teachers exhibited most of the behaviours of speaking up. ‘Sharing information’ strongly resembles providing information and ‘talking about mistakes’ occurs in a general sense and without commitment of improvement activities. ‘Asking questions’ was often displayed by closed questions and at times several questions simultaneously. The authors identified factors that influence speaking up by clinical teachers: relational, cultural, and professional. The clinical teachers exhibit speaking up, but there is only limited awareness to discuss problems or mistakes and the discussion centred mainly on the question of blame. It is important to take into account the factors that influence speaking up, in order to stimulate open communication during the teaching team meetings. © The Author(s) 2015.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008474316"

Medical student empathy is one aspect of the physician–patient relationship that is often involved in beneficial interactions leading to improved clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction. As an interpersonal quality, empathy is a social behavior well-suited to be examined from an interpersonal perspective. The present study used the interpersonal theory of clinical, personality, and social psychology to examine the construct of empathy and theorize about likely interpersonal correlates. One hundred and sixty-three students from an academic health center in the southeastern United States participated in this study. The medical student version of the Jefferson Scale of Empathy was used to assess empathy and its factors: Perspective taking, compassionate care, and walking in the patient’s shoes. Interpersonal assessments included the International Personality Item Pool—Interpersonal Circumplex, the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List, and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. Distinct interpersonal styles and correlates emerged among empathy and its factors. While all factors of empathy were related to interpersonal warmth, perspective taking and compassionate care were also associated with submissiveness. Of note, only walking in the patient’s shoes was correlated with both social support and less loneliness. These findings are discussed in light of interpersonal theory with particular attention paid to the implications for medical education and professional development. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960405778"

In 2012 and 2013, three standardized-patient-based P-MEX encounters were administered to applicants invited for an interview at the University of Geneva Pediatrics Residency Program. Validity evidence was gathered for P-MEX content (item analysis); response process (qualitative feedback); internal structure (inter-rater reliability with intraclass correlation and Generalizability); relations to other variables (correlations); and consequences (logistic regression to predict admission). To improve reliability, Kane’s formula was used to create an applicant composite score using P-MEX, structured letter of recommendation (SLR), and structured interview (SI) scores. Applicant rank lists using composite scores versus faculty global ratings were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Seventy applicants were assessed. Moderate associations were found between pairwise correlations of P-MEX scores and SLR (r = 0.25, P = .036), SI (r = 0.34, P = .004), and global ratings (r = 0.48, P < .001). Generalizability of the P-MEX using three cases was moderate (G-coefficient = 0.45). P-MEX scores had the greatest correlation with acceptance (r = 0.56, P < .001), were the strongest predictor of acceptance (OR 4.37, P < .001), and increased pseudo R-squared by 0.20 points. Including P-MEX scores increased composite score reliability from 0.51 to 0.74. Rank lists of applicants using composite score versus global rating differed significantly (z = 5.41, P < .001). Validity evidence supports the use of P-MEX scores to improve the reliability of the residency admissions process by improving applicant composite score reliability. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964282763"

It is, however, only one of many influences on what is actually discussed in feedback. The sociohistorical culture of medicine and individual supervisors’ contexts, experiences and beliefs are also influential. Our aim was to find how CanMEDS roles are constructed in feedback in a postgraduate curriculum-in-action. We applied a set of discourse analytic tools to written feedback from 591 feedback forms from 7 hospitals, including 3150 feedback comments in which 126 supervisors provided feedback to 120 residents after observing their performance in authentic settings. The role of Collaborator was constructed in two different ways: a cooperative discourse of equality with other workers and patients; and a discourse, which gave residents positions of power—delegating, asserting and ‘taking a firm stance’. Efficiency—being fast and to the point emerged as an important attribute of physicians. Patients were seldom part of the discourses and, when they were, they were constructed as objects of communication and collaboration rather than partners. Although some of the discourses are in line with what might be expected, others were in striking contrast to the spirit of CanMEDS. This study’s findings suggest that it takes more than a competency framework, evaluation instruments, and supervisor training to change the culture of workplaces. The impact on residents of training in such demanding, efficiency-focused clinical environments is an important topic for future research. © 2015, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84940826379"

The purpose of this reflections paper is to cast a critical lens on current assessment practices and to offer insights into ways in which they might be adapted to ensure alignment with modern conceptions of health professional education for the ultimate goal of improved healthcare. Three dominant themes will be addressed: (1) The need to redress unintended consequences of competency-based assessment; (2) The potential to design assessment systems that facilitate performance improvement; and (3) The importance of ensuring authentic linkage between assessment and practice. Several principles cut across each of these themes and represent the foundational goals we would put forward as signposts for decision making about the continued evolution of assessment practices in the health professions: (1) Increasing opportunities to promote learning rather than simply measuring performance; (2) Enabling integration across stages of training and practice; and (3) Reinforcing point-in-time assessments with continuous professional development in a way that enhances shared responsibility and accountability between practitioners, educational programs, and testing organizations. Many of the ideas generated represent suggestions for strategies to pilot test, for infrastructure to build, and for harmonization across groups to be enabled. These include novel strategies for OSCE station development, formative (diagnostic) assessment protocols tailored to shed light on the practices of individual clinicians, the use of continuous workplace-based assessment, and broadening the focus of high-stakes decision making beyond determining who passes and who fails. We conclude with reflections on systemic (i.e., cultural) barriers that may need to be overcome to move towards a more integrated, efficient, and effective system of assessment. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947705073"

However, our current understanding of student-level clinical reasoning is limited, mainly because of the lack of evaluation tools for this internal cognitive process. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study aimed to examine the clinical reasoning processes of medical students in response to problem-solving questions. We recruited 24 2nd-year medical students who had completed their preclinical curriculum. They answered 40 clinical vignette-based multiple-choice questions during fMRI scanning. We compared the imaging data for 20 problem-solving questions (reasoning task) and 20 recall questions (recall task). Compared to the recall task, the reasoning task resulted in significantly greater activation in nine brain regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal cortex, which are known to be associated with executive function and deductive reasoning. During the recall task, significant activation was observed in the brain regions that are related to memory and emotions, including the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Our results support that medical students mainly solve clinical questions with deductive reasoning involving prior knowledge structures and executive functions. The problem-solving questions induced the students to utilize higher cognitive functions compared with the recall questions. Interestingly, the results suggested that the students experienced some emotional distress while they were solving the recall questions. In addition, these results suggest that fMRI is a promising research tool for investigating students’ cognitive processes. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84969920262"

Raters are intrinsic to PBA and the increased use of PBA has lead to an increased interest in rater cognition. Although several researchers have tackled factors that may influence the variability in rater judgment, the critical examination of rater observation of performance and the translation of that data into judgements are being investigated. The purpose of this study was to qualitatively investigate the cognitive processes of raters, and to create a framework that conceptualizes those processes when raters assess a complex performance. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 faculty members (nominated as excellent assessors) from a Department of Medicine to investigate how raters observe, interpret, and translate performance into judgments. The transcribed verbal protocols were analyzed using Constructivist Grounded Theory in order to develop a theoretical model of raters’ assessment processes. Several themes emerged from the data and were grouped according to three macro-level themes describing how the raters balance two sources of data [(1) external sources of information and (2) internal/personal sources of information] by relying on specific cognitive processes to assess an examinee performance. The results from our study demonstrate that assessment is a difficult cognitive task that involves nuance using specific cognitive processes to weigh external and internal data against each other. Our data clearly draws attention to the constant struggle between objectivity and subjectivity that is observed in assessment as illustrated by the importance given to nuancing the examinee’s observed performance. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84948964700"

Given existing evidence of conflict between and dissatisfaction among rounds participants, this study sought to better understand how the operational realities of care delivery in the intensive care unit (ICU) impact the success of MIRs. We conducted a year-long comparative ethnographic study of interprofessional collaboration and patient and family involvement in four ICUs in tertiary academic hospitals in two American cities. The study included 576 h of observation of team interactions, 47 shadowing sessions and 40 clinician interviews. In line with best practices in ethnographic research, data collection and analysis were done iteratively using the constant comparative method. Member check was conducted regularly throughout the project. MIRs were implemented on all units with the explicit goals of improving team-based and patient-centered care. Operational conditions on the units, despite interprofessional commitment and engagement, appeared to thwart ICU teams from achieving these goals. Specifically, time constraints, struggles over space, and conflicts between MIRs’ educational and care-plan-development functions all prevented teams from achieving collaboration and patient-involvement. Moreover, physicians’ de facto control of rounds often meant that they resembled medical rounds (their historical predecessors), and sidelined other providers’ contributions. This study suggests that the MIRs model, as presently practiced, might not be well suited to the provision of team-based, patient-centered care. In the interest of interprofessional collaboration, of the optimization of clinicians’ time, of high-quality medical education and of patient-centered care, further research on interprofessional rounds models is needed. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84951777329"

Compared with Dutch students, the three non-Western ethnic minority groups (Turkish/Moroccan/African, Surinamese/Antillean and Asian) underperformed in the clinical problem solving tests, the language test and the OSCEs. Findings on the theoretical end-of-block tests and writing skills tests, and results for Western minority students were less consistent. Age, gender, pre-university grade point average and additional socio-demographic variables (including first-generation university student, first language, and medical doctor parent) could explain the ethnicity-related differences in theoretical examinations, but not in language, clinical and writing skills examinations. First-generation university students only underperformed in the language test. Apparently, underperformance differs both across ethnic subgroups and between different types of written and clinical examinations. Medical schools should ensure their assessment strategies create a level playing field for all students and explore reasons for underperformance in the clinical and writing skills examinations. © 2016, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84961659541"

This study examined residents’ and consultants’ attitudes and beliefs regarding workplace learning and contextual and organisational factors influencing the organisation and planning of medical specialist training. An explorative case study in three paediatric departments in Denmark including 9 days of field observations and focus group interviews with 9 consultants responsible for medical education and 16 residents. The study aimed to identify factors in work organisation facilitating and hindering residents’ learning. Data were coded through an iterative process guided by thematic analysis. Findings illustrate three main themes: (1) Learning beliefs about patient care and apprenticeship learning as inseparable in medical practice. Beliefs about training and patient care expressed in terms of training versus production caused a potential conflict. (2) Learning context. Continuity over time in tasks and care for patients is important, but continuity is challenged by the organisation of daily work routines. (3) Organisational culture and regulations were found to be encouraging as well inhibiting to a successful organisation of the work in regards to learning. Our findings stress the importance of consultants’ and residents’ beliefs about workplace learning as these agents handle the potential conflict between patient care and training of health professionals. The structuring of daily work tasks is a key factor in workplace learning as is an understanding of underlying relations and organisational culture in the clinical departments. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84951727308"

Questions have been raised about the adequacy of current approaches. Here, we integrate realist and theory-driven evaluation approaches, to evaluate an intensive longitudinal program. Our aim is to elucidate how faculty development can work to support a range of outcomes among individuals and sub-systems in the academic health sciences. We conducted retrospective framework analysis of qualitative focus group data gathered from 79 program participants (5 cohorts) over a 10-year period. Additionally, we conducted follow-up interviews with 15 alumni. We represent the interactive relationships among contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes as a “mandala” of faculty development. The mandala illustrates the relationship between the immediate program context, and the broader institutional context of academic health sciences, and identifies relevant change mechanisms. Four primary mechanisms were collaborative-reflection, self-reflection and self-regulation, relationship building, and pedagogical knowledge acquisition. Individual outcomes, including changed teaching practices, are described. Perhaps most interestingly, secondary mechanisms—psychological and structural empowerment—contributed to institutional outcomes through participants’ engagement in change leadership in their local contexts. Our theoretically informed evaluation approach models how faculty development, situated in appropriate institutional contexts, can trigger mechanisms that yield a range of benefits for faculty and their institutions. The adopted methods hold potential as a way to demonstrate the often difficult-to-measure outcomes of educational programs, and allow for critical examination as to how and whether faculty development programs can accomplish their espoused goals. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84974802769"

In order to improve our instructional designs, better insight into the cause of this lack of transfer is foundational. We therefore explored students’ cognitions by soliciting self-evaluations of their history-taking skills, coined ‘judgments of satisfaction (JOSs)’. Our cognitive-psychological approach was guided by Koriat’s cue-utilization framework (J Exp Psychol Gen 126:349–370. doi:10.1037/0096-3445.126.4.349, 1997) which rests on the assumption that internal and external cues inform learners’ metacognitive judgments, which, in turn, steer their actions. Judgments based on unsuitable cues will cause ineffective behavior. Consequently, students are unable to adequately master these skills or properly apply them in similar situations. For the analysis, we had 524 medical undergraduates select scenes they were satisfied or dissatisfied with from their video-recorded simulated-patient encounters and explain why. Twenty transcripts were sampled for directed content analysis. We found that approximately one-third of students’ judgments focused on content (JOS-type-a); about half on the quality of the communication skills (JOS-type-b); and about ten percent targeted the appropriateness of the skills harnessed (JOS-type-c). This lack of reflection on appropriateness may explain why students experience problems adapting to new situations. It was primarily high-performance students who formed type-c judgments; poor performers tended to give type-a and type-b judgments. Future research would benefit from the use of our modified version of Koriat’s framework in order to further explore how high and poor performing medical students differ in the way they form JOSs during communications skills training. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84944537049"

In a recent study we found that preclinical medical students’ ratings of classroom teachers were associated with perceived charisma and physical attractiveness of the teacher, but not intellect. Here we explored whether the relationship between these variables and teaching effectiveness ratings holds in the clinical setting. We asked 27 Internal Medicine residents to rate teaching effectiveness of ten teachers with whom they had worked on a clinical rotation, in addition to rating each teacher’s clinical skills, physical attractiveness, and charisma. We used linear regression to study the association between these explanatory variables and teaching effectiveness ratings. We found no association between rating of physical attractiveness and teaching effectiveness. Clinical skill and charisma were independently associated with rating of teaching effectiveness (regression coefficients [95 % confidence interval] 0.73 [0.60, 0.85], p < 0.001 and 0.12 [0.01, 0.23], p = 0.03, respectively). The variables associated with effectiveness of classroom and clinical teachers differ, suggesting context specificity in teaching effectiveness ratings. Context specificity may be explained by differences in the exposure that learners have to teachers in the classroom versus clinical setting—so that raters in the clinical setting may base ratings upon observed behaviours rather than stereotype data. Alternatively, since subjective ratings of teaching effectiveness inevitably incorporate learners’ context-specific needs, the attributes that make a teacher effective in one context may not meet the needs of learners in a different context. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84985911958"

It could be argued that mass adoption without careful attention to purpose and format may well jeopardize portfolios’ viability in health sciences education. This paper explores this proposition by addressing the following three main questions: (1) Why do portfolios meet with such resistance from students and teachers, while educators love them?; (2) Is it ethical to require students to reflect and then grade their reflections?; (3) Does competency-based education empower or hamper the learner during workplace-based learning? Twenty-five years of portfolio reveal a clear story: without mentoring, portfolios have no future and are nothing short of bureaucratic hurdles in our competency-based education programs. Moreover, comprehensiveportfolios, which are integrated into the curriculum and much more diverse in content than reflective portfolios, can serve as meaningful patient charts, providing doctor and patient with useful information to discuss well-being and treatment. In this sense, portfolios are also learner charts that comprehensively document progress in a learning trajectory which is lubricated by meaningful dialogue between learner and mentor in a trusting relationship to foster learning. If we are able to make such comprehensive and meaningful use of portfolios, then, yes, portfolios do have a bright future in medical education. © 2016, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962244594"

Here, we report a two-phased study investigating the sensitivity of subjective ratings of mental effort (SRME) and secondary-task performance (signal detection rate, SDR and recognition reaction time, RRT) as measures of CL. In phase 1 of the study, novice learners and expert surgeons attempted a visual-monitoring task under two conditions: single-task (monitoring a virtual patient’s heart-rate) and dual-task (tying surgical knots on a bench-top simulator while monitoring the virtual patient’s heart-rate). Novices demonstrated higher mental effort and inferior secondary-task performance on the dual-task compared to experts (RRT 1.76 vs. 0.73, p = 0.012; SDR 0.27 vs. 0.97, p < 0.001; SRME 7.75 vs. 2.80, p < 0.001). Similarly, secondary task performance deteriorated from baseline to dual-task among novices (RRT 0.63 vs. 1.76 s, p < 0.006 and SDR 1.00 vs. 0.27, p < 0.001), but not experts (RRT 0.63 vs. 0.73 s, p = 0.124 and SDR 1.00 vs. 0.97, p = 0.178). In phase 2, novices practiced surgical knot-tying on the bench top simulator during consecutive dual-task trials. A significant increase in SDR (F(9,63) = 6.63, p < 0.001, f = 0.97) and decrease in SRME (F(9,63) = 9.39, p < 0.001, f = 1.04) was observed during simulation training, while RRT did not change significantly (F(9,63) = 1.18, p < 0.32, f = 0.41). The results suggest subjective ratings and dual-task performance can be used to track changes in CL among novices, particularly in early phases of simulation-based skills training. The implications for measuring CL in simulation instructional design research are discussed. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947046160"

This study aimed at developing and validating a test to assess diagnostic accuracy, collected information, and diagnostic decision time in clinical reasoning. A norm-referenced computer-based test for the assessment of clinical reasoning (ASCLIRE) was developed, integrating the entire clinical decision process. In a cross-sectional study participants were asked to choose as many diagnostic measures as they deemed necessary to diagnose the underlying disease of six different cases with acute or sub-acute dyspnea and provide a diagnosis. 283 students and 20 content experts participated. In addition to diagnostic accuracy, respective decision time and number of used relevant diagnostic measures were documented as distinct performance indicators. The empirical structure of the test was investigated using a structural equation modeling approach. Experts showed higher accuracy rates and lower decision times than students. In a cross-sectional comparison, the diagnostic accuracy of students improved with the year of study. Wrong diagnoses provided by our sample were comparable to wrong diagnoses in practice. We found an excellent fit for a model with three latent factors—diagnostic accuracy, decision time, and choice of relevant diagnostic information—with diagnostic accuracy showing no significant correlation with decision time.

As clinicians progress from novice to expert, research indicates decision-making becomes less reliant on foundational biomedical knowledge and more on previous experience. In this study, we investigated how knowledge and experience were reflected in terms of differences in neural areas of activation. Novice and expert clinicians diagnosed simple or complex (easy, hard) cases while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected. Our results highlight key differences in the neural areas activated in novices and experts during the clinical decision-making process. fMRI data were collected from ten second year medical students (novices) and ten practicing gastroenterologists (experts) while they diagnosed sixteen (eight easy and eight hard) clinical cases via multiple-choice questions. Behavioral data were collected for diagnostic accuracy (correct/incorrect diagnosis) and time taken to assign a clinical diagnosis. Two analyses were performed with the fMRI data. First, data from easy and hard cases were compared within respective groups (easy > hard, hard > easy). Second, neural differences between novices and experts (novice > expert, expert > novice) were assessed. Experts correctly diagnosed more cases than novices and made their diagnoses faster than novices on both easy and hard cases (all p’s < 0.05). Time taken to diagnose hard cases took significantly longer for both novices and experts. While similar neural areas were activated in both novices and experts during the decision making process, we identified significant hemispheric activation differences between novice and expert clinicians when diagnosing hard clinical cases. Specifically, novice clinicians had greater activations in the left anterior temporal cortex and left ventral lateral prefrontal cortex whereas expert clinicians had greater activations in the right dorsal lateral, right ventral lateral, and right parietal cortex. Hemispheric differences in activation were not observed between novices and experts while diagnosing easy clinical cases. While clinical decision-making engaged the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in both novices and experts, interestingly we observed expertise related differences in the regions and hemispheres of PFC activation between these groups for hard clinical cases. Specifically, in novices we observed activations in left hemisphere neural regions associated with factual rule-based knowledge, whereas in experts we observed right hemisphere activation in neural regions associated with experiential knowledge. Importantly, at the neural level, our data highlight differences in so called type 2 clinical decision-making processes related to prior knowledge and experience. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946137846"

However, writing SBA questions with four effective incorrect options is difficult and time consuming, and consequently, many SBAs contain a high frequency of implausible distractors. Previous research has suggested that fewer than five-options could hence be used for assessment, without deterioration in quality. Despite an existing body of empirical research in this area however, evidence from undergraduate medical education is sparse. The study investigated the frequency of non-functioning distractors in a sample of 480 summative SBA questions at Cardiff University. Distractor functionality was analysed, and then various question models were tested to investigate the impact of reducing the number of distractors per question on examination difficulty, reliability, discrimination and pass rates. A survey questionnaire was additionally administered to 108 students (33 % response rate) to gain insight into their perceptions of these models. The simulation of various exam models revealed that, for four and three-option SBA models, pass rates, reliability, and mean item discrimination remained relatively constant. The average percentage mark however consistently increased by 1–3 % with the four and three-option models, respectively. The questionnaire survey revealed that the student body had mixed views towards the proposed format change. This study is one of the first to comprehensively investigate distractor performance in SBA examinations in undergraduate medical education. It provides evidence to suggest that using three-option SBA questions would maximise efficiency whilst maintaining, or possibly improving, psychometric quality, through allowing a greater number of questions per exam paper. © 2015, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947939643"

As a teaching topic, however, there is no accepted gold standard for human medical ethics, and veterinary medical ethics is not yet well established. This paper provides a reflection on the underlying aims of human and veterinary medical ethics education. Drawing from published literature on ethics education in the health professions a theoretical framework common to the teaching of human and veterinary medical ethics is proposed, based on three concepts: professional rules, moral virtues and ethical skills. The rules approach relies on the transmission of professional and social values by means of regulatory documents and depends intimately on the knowledge that students have of those documents. The virtues approach involves the inculcation of moral values and virtues that will stimulate students to develop desirable behaviours. The main focus of this approach to ethics is to develop students’ attitudinal competences. Finally, the skills approach is focused on equipping the students with the necessary moral reasoning abilities to recognise and respect the plurality of ethical views that make part of contemporary society. This framework can inform future curriculum development in human and veterinary medical ethics as well as in other health care professions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84949997892"

The branch of linguistics called pragmatics argues that much of our day to day language is not meant to be interpreted literally. Within pragmatics, the theory of 'politeness' suggests that nonliteral language and other strategies are employed in order to 'save face'. We conducted a rigorous, in-depth analysis of a set of written in-training evaluation report (ITER) comments using Brown and Levinson's influential theory of 'politeness' to shed light on the phenomenon of vague language use in assessment. We coded text from 637 comment boxes from first year residents in internal medicine at one institution according to politeness theory. Non-literal language use was common and 'hedging', a key politeness strategy, was pervasive in comments about both high and low rated residents, suggesting that faculty may be working to 'save face' for themselves and their residents. Hedging and other politeness strategies are considered essential to smooth social functioning; their prevalence in our ITERs may reflect the difficult social context in which written assessments occur. This research raises questions regarding the 'optimal' construction of written comments by faculty. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007442740"

The predictive value of these different types of selection criteria has however never been investigated within the same curriculum while using a control group. We therefore set up a study that enabled us to compare the academic performance of three different admission groups, all composed of school-leaver entry students, and all enrolled in the same Bachelor curriculum: students selected on non-cognitive criteria, students selected on cognitive criteria and students admitted by lottery. First-year GPA and number of course credits (ECTS) at 52 weeks after enrollment of non-cognitive selected students (N = 102), cognitive selected students (N = 92) and lottery-admitted students (N = 356) were analyzed. In addition, chances of dropping out, probability of passing the third-year OSCE, and completing the Bachelor program in 3 years were compared. Although there were no significant differences between the admission groups in first-year GPA, cognitive selected students had obtained significantly more ECTS at 52 weeks and dropped out less often than lottery-admitted students. Probabilities of passing the OSCE and completing the bachelor program in 3 years did not significantly differ between the groups. These findings indicate that the use of only non-cognitive selection criteria is not sufficient to select the best academically performing students, most probably because a minimal cognitive basis is needed to succeed in medical school. © The Author(s) 2015.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85008517891"

As a result clinical learning is highly demanding for students. Because of large differences between students, supervisors may not know how to support them in their learning process. We explored patterns in undergraduate students’ self-regulated learning behavior in the clinical environment, to improve tailored supervision, using Q-methodology. Q-methodology uses features of both qualitative and quantitative methods for the systematic investigation of subjective issues by having participants sort statements along a continuum to represent their opinion. We enrolled 74 students between December 2014 and April 2015 and had them characterize their learning behavior by sorting 52 statements about self-regulated learning behavior and explaining their response. The statements used for the sorting were extracted from a previous study. The data was analyzed using by-person factor analysis to identify clusters of individuals with similar sorts of the statements. The resulting factors and qualitative data were used to interpret and describe the patterns that emerged. Five resulting patterns were identified in students’ self-regulated learning behavior in the clinical environment, which we labelled: Engaged, Critically opportunistic, Uncertain, Restrained and Effortful. The five patterns varied mostly regarding goals, metacognition, communication, effort, and dependence on external regulation for learning. These discrete patterns in students’ self-regulated learning behavior in the clinical environment are part of a complex interaction between student and learning context. The results suggest that developing self-regulated learning behavior might best be supported regarding individual students’ needs. © 2016, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84971013885"

The study employed a mixed methods approach, collecting self-reported survey data, observations of, and reflective interviews with, the medical students observed. Participants were in their first year of clinical placements. Data were thematically analysed. Students indicated that PAL contributed to both the comprehension of notions of quality, and the practice of making comparisons between a given performance and the standards. Emergent themes included peer story-telling, direct observation of performance, and peer-based feedback, all of which helped students to define ‘work quality’. By participating in PAL, students were required to make comparisons, therefore using the standards of practice and gaining a deeper understanding of them. The data revealed tensions in that peers were seen as less threatening than supervisors with the advantage of increasing learners’ appetites for thoughtful ‘intellectual risk taking’. Despite this reported advantage of peer engagement, learners still expressed a preference for feedback from senior teachers as more trusted sources of clinical knowledge. While this study suggests that PAL already contributes to the development of evaluative judgement, further steps could be taken to formalise PAL in clinical placements to improve learners’ capacity to make accurate judgements on the performance of self and others. Further experimental studies are necessary to confirm the best methods of using PAL to develop evaluative judgement. This may include both students and educators as instigators of PAL in the workplace. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84949642626"

Assuming such roles in today’s clinical environments may be challenging. Acute care environments present unique learning opportunities for medical trainees, as well as specific challenges. The goal of this paper was to better understand the specific contexts in which overt teaching interactions occurred in acute care environments. We conducted a naturalistic observational study based on constructivist grounded theory methodology. Using participant observation, we collected data on the teaching interactions occurring between clinical supervisors and medical trainees during 74 acute care episodes in the critical care unit of two academic centers, in Toronto, Canada. Three themes contributed to a better understanding of the conditions in which overt teaching interactions among trainees and clinical supervisors occurred during acute care episodes: seizing emergent learning opportunities, coming up against challenging conditions, and creating learning momentum. Our findings illustrate how overt learning opportunities emerged from certain clinical situations and how clinical supervisors and trainees could purposefully modify unfavorable learning conditions. None of the acute care episodes encountered in the critical care environment represented ideal conditions for learning. Yet, clinical supervisors and trainees succeeded in engaging in overt teaching interactions during many episodes. The educational value of these overt teaching interactions should be further explored, as well as the impact of interventions aimed at increasing their use in acute care environments. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941416653"

A previous study had indicated a significant influence of the tutor’s social congruent behaviour on the PBL process and this study further investigates this finding by examining two groups of tutors displaying differences in social congruence. The participants were 77 students under the tutelage of four tutors and a self-report questionnaire ranked two tutors to be more socially congruent as compared to the other two. Student learning was measured by a concept recall test and the results from the analysis of covariance indicated a significant impact of the tutor’s social congruent behaviour on learning after the problem analysis phase but not on the self-directed learning and reporting phases. It was concluded that the academic abilities of students and the small number of tutors involved may have affected the results, which led to the second part of this study. A group of 11 tutors were selected and the impact of their behaviours on student achievement measured by the module grade was examined. Results indicated that the tutor behaviours had a greater influence on average students as compared to the academically stronger and weaker students. This finding suggests that students who are academically stronger are not as reliant on the tutor while average students may depend more on the tutor to guide and motivate them in order to achieve the learning goals. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939881790"

Discussions often focus on deficient academic and motivational traits of state school students, rather than considering the effects of student support during the admissions process. This qualitative study explored student experiences of support from schools and families during the medical school admissions process with particular focus on the personal statement. Interviews were conducted with thirteen medical students at a British medical school who had each attended a different secondary school (classified as private or state funded). A thematic analysis was performed. Bourdieu’s concepts of capital and field were used as a theoretical lens through which to view the results. Interviews revealed substantial differences in support provided by private and state funded schools. Private schools had much more experience in the field of medical school admissions and had a vested interest in providing students with support. State schools were lacking by comparison, offering limited support that was often reactive rather than proactive. Students from private schools were also more likely to have social contacts who were knowledgeable about medical school admissions and who could help them gain access to work experience opportunities that would be recognised as legitimate by selectors. While medical schools endeavour to make fair admissions policies, there is an unintended link between a student’s access to capital and ability to demonstrate commitment and motivation on personal statements. This helps explain why academically capable but financially or socially challenged students are less likely to be recognised as having potential during the admissions process. Medical schools need to be challenged to review their admissions policies to ensure that the do not inadvertently favour cultural privilege rather than student potential. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937572957"

Residents face special risks of involvement in medical errors since they have tremendous responsibility for patient care, yet they are novice practitioners in the process of learning and mastering their profession. The present study explores the relationships between residents’ error rates and three clinical training methods (1) progressive independence or level of autonomy, (2) consulting the physician on call, and (3) familiarity with up-to-date medical literature, and whether these relationships vary among the specialties of surgery and internal medicine and between novice and experienced residents. 142 Residents in 22 medical departments from two hospitals participated in the study. Results of hierarchical linear model analysis indicated that lower levels of autonomy, higher levels of consultation with the physician on call, and higher levels of familiarity with up-to-date medical literature were associated with lower levels of resident’s error rates. The associations varied between internal and surgery specializations and novice and experienced residents. In conclusion, the study results suggested that the implicit curriculum that residents should be afforded autonomy and progressive independence with nominal supervision in accordance with their relevant skills and experience must be applied cautiously depending on specialization and experience. In addition, it is necessary to create a supportive and judgment free climate within the department that may reduce a resident’s hesitation to consult the attending physician. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84928581165"

Policy calls for more effective education to address this though there is little consensus on what this entails. The purpose of this clarification study is to explore how practice gaps are constructed in relation to managing the confused hospitalised older patient. The intent is to inform educational processes in the work-place beyond traditional approaches such as training. Adopting grounded theory as a research method and working within a social constructionist paradigm we explored the practice gaps of 15 healthcare professionals by interview and conducted five focus groups with patients, carers and Liaison mental health professionals. Data were thematically analysed by constant comparison and theoretical sampling was undertaken until saturation reached. Categories were identified and pragmatic concepts developed grounded within the data. Findings were then further analysed using cultural historical activity theory as a deductive lens. Practice gaps in relation to managing the confused older patient are determined by factors operating at individual (knowledge and skill gaps, personal philosophy, task based practice), team (leadership, time and ward environmental factors) and organisational (power relationships, dominance of medical model, fragmentation of care services) levels. Conceptually, practice appeared to be influenced by socio-cultural ward factors and compounded by a failure to join up existing “patient” knowledge amongst professionals. Applying cultural historical activity theory to further illuminate the findings, the central object is defined as learning about the patient and the mediating artifacts are the care relationships. The overarching medical dominance emerges as an important cultural historical factor at play and staff rules and divisions of labour are exposed. Lastly key contradictions and tensions in the system that work against learning about the patient are identified. Cultural historical activity theory can be used to advance understanding of practice gaps in order to develop a broader transformative approach to dementia and delirium practice and education. Structural changes at an individual, team and systems level resulting from this novel understanding of practice complexity are proposed. Contradictions can be used as foci for expansive learning. Lastly, interprofessional education (formal and informal) is advocated to further knotwork and improve the care of the older confused patient. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937643752"

To explore relations between the satisfaction of three basic psychological needs towards medical teaching and two policy initiatives for medical teaching: (Junior) Principal Lecturer positions [(J)PL positions] and Subsidized Innovation and Research Projects in Medical Education (SIRPMEs). An online questionnaire was used to collect data about medical teaching in the setting of a university hospital. We adapted the Work-related Basic Need Satisfaction scale (Van den Broeck et al. in J Occup Organ Psychol, 83(4):981–1002, 2010), in order to measure feelings of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in teaching. We examined the relations between (J)PL positions and SIRPMEs and the satisfaction of three basic psychological needs. A total of 767 medical teachers participated. The initiatives appear to be related to different beneficial outcomes in terms of feelings of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in medical teaching. Either a (J)PL position is obtained by teachers who feel competent and related towards medical teaching, or obtaining a (J)PL position makes teachers feel more competent and related towards teaching, or these relations could be interacting. Also, either a SIRPME is obtained by teachers who feel competent and autonomous towards medical teaching, or obtaining a SIRPME makes teachers feel more competent and autonomous towards teaching, or these relations could be interacting. Additional research needs to scrutinize the causal or interacting relations further and to determine optimal conditions for these policy initiatives more specifically. Implications for future research are discussed. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941426896"

We re-analyzed the results of a meta-analysis of simulation-based education to determine study power across a range of effect sizes, and the smallest effect that could be plausibly excluded. We systematically searched multiple databases through May 2011, and included all studies evaluating simulation-based education for health professionals in comparison with no intervention or another simulation intervention. Reviewers working in duplicate abstracted information to calculate standardized mean differences (SMD’s). We included 897 original research studies. Among the 627 no-intervention-comparison studies the median sample size was 25. Only two studies (0.3 %) had ≥80 % power to detect a small difference (SMD > 0.2 standard deviations) and 136 (22 %) had power to detect a large difference (SMD > 0.8). 110 no-intervention-comparison studies failed to find a statistically significant difference, but none excluded a small difference and only 47 (43 %) excluded a large difference. Among 297 studies comparing alternate simulation approaches the median sample size was 30. Only one study (0.3 %) had ≥80 % power to detect a small difference and 79 (27 %) had power to detect a large difference. Of the 128 studies that did not detect a statistically significant effect, 4 (3 %) excluded a small difference and 91 (71 %) excluded a large difference. In conclusion, most education research studies are powered only to detect effects of large magnitude. For most studies that do not reach statistical significance, the possibility of large and important differences still exists. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939896120"

Discrete-option multiple-choice (DOMC) has recently been proposed as a computerized alternative testing format for MC tests, and presumably allows for a better control of testwiseness. It is based on a sequential rather than simultaneous presentation of answer options. The test taker has to decide on the correctness of one option after another, until the item has been answered either correctly or incorrectly. Test items that have been criticized for being susceptible to testwiseness strategies are used in continuing medical education (CME) programs aimed at developing and maintaining the knowledge of medical professionals. In Experiment 1 with 48 adults without a special medical education, presenting answer options sequentially reduced the use of testwiseness cues on a CME test compared to their simultaneous presentation as shown by a significant interaction of answer format and the availability of cues (p = .01, η2 = 0.13). This result was not dependent on a hint towards potential cues to the solution, as it also held when another 86 adults were not informed of the presence of testwiseness cues in Experiment 2 (p < .001, η2 = 0.14). The result could be replicated with 106 medical students and medical doctors in Experiment 3. Items were answered correctly more often in the MC condition (71 %) than in the DOMC condition (47 %), but only when items contained cues to their solution. A significant interaction between answer format and the availability of cues (p = .02, η2 = 0.05) showed that the sequential DOMC answer format allows for a better control of testwiseness than traditional MC testing. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939885359"

Using a sociocultural perspective of learning and an interpretative approach, 15 in-depth interviews with medical and nursing students were analysed with content analysis. Students’ experiences are described using a framework of ‘before’, ‘during’ and ‘after’ clinical placements. Three major themes emerged from the analysis, contrasting the medical and nursing students’ experiences of the clinical learning environment: (1) expectations of the placement; (2) relationship with the supervisor; and (3) focus of learning. The findings offer an increased understanding of how medical and nursing students learn in the clinical setting; they also show that the clinical learning environment contributes to the socialisation process of students not only into their future profession, but also into their role as learners. Differences between the two professions should be taken into consideration when designing interprofessional learning activities. Also, the findings can be used as a tool for clinical supervisors in the reflection on how student learning in the clinical learning environment can be improved. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937636982"

The following outcome variables were measured at pre- and post-intervention: mindfulness (with Mindful Awareness Attention Scale); perceived stress (with Perceived Stress Scale); mental distress (with General Health Questionnaire), and self-efficacy (with General Self-efficacy Scale). Hierarchical multiple regressions were used to analyse the effect of group (intervention vs. control) on changes in the outcome variables. There were significant improvements at one week post-intervention in all outcome variables: mindfulness (β = 0.19, ΔR2 = 0.04, p = .040, f2 = 0.05), perceived stress (β = −0.26, ΔR2 = 0.07, p = .009, f2 = 0.10); mental distress (β = −0.28, ΔR2 = 0.10, p = .003, f2 = 0.15); and self-efficacy (β = 0.30, ΔR2 = 0.09, p < .001, f2 = 0.21). Six months after the intervention, those who had joined the program reported higher self-efficacy compared to those in the control group (β = 0.24, ΔR2 = 0.06, p = .020, f2 = 0.08); but there was no difference in other outcome measures. More than 90 % of the participants found the program applicable in helping patients and all reported that they would recommend it to others. This study indicates that the program is potentially an effective stress management program for medical students in Malaysia. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947036464"

This paper “The cost of a medical education” outlines the likely costs associated with undergraduate education at the end of the nineteenth century, and offers guidance to the student on how to make financial planning. Many lessons can be gleaned from the paper about the cost and other aspects of nineteenth century medical education. Cost is viewed almost exclusively from the domain of the male gender. Cost is viewed not just from the perspective of a young man but of a young gentleman. There is a strong implication that medicine is a club and that you have to have money to join the club and then to take part in the club’s activities. Cost affects choice of medical school and selection into schools. The paper places great emphasis on the importance of passing exams at their first sitting and progressing through each year in a timely manner—mainly to save costs. The subject of cost is viewed from the perspective of the payer—at this time students and their families. The paper encourages the reader to reflect on what has and has not changed in this field since 1893. Modern medical education is still expensive; its expense deters students; and we have only started to think about how to control costs or how to ensure value. Too much of the cost of medical education continues to burden students and their families. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941423862"

Formalizing this verification process with checklists, which highlight key variables involved in the diagnostic decision, is often advocated. However, the mechanisms by which a checklist might allow clinicians to improve their verification process have not been well studied. We hypothesize that using a checklist to verify diagnostic decisions enhances analytic scrutiny of key variables, thereby improving clinicians’ ability to find and fix mistakes. We asked 16 participants to verify their interpretation of 12 electrocardiograms, randomly assigning half to be verified with a checklist and half with an analytic prompt. While participants were verifying their interpretation, we tracked their eye movements. We analyzed these eye movements using a series of eye tracking variables theoretically linked to analytic scrutiny of key variables. We found that more errors were corrected using a checklist compared to an analytic prompt (.27 ± .53 errors per ECG vs.04 ± .43, F1,15 = 8.1, p = .01, η2 = .20). Checklist use was associated with enhanced analytic scrutiny in all eye tracking measures assessed (F6,10 = 6.0, p = .02). In this experiment, using a key variable checklist to verify diagnostic decisions improved error detection. This benefit was associated with enhanced analytic scrutiny of those key variables as measured by eye tracking. © 2015, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941425329"

As a result, curriculum leaders evaluate clinical educational environments. The quantitative Dundee Ready Environment Measure (DREEM) is a de facto standard for that purpose. Its 50 items and 5 subscales were developed by consensus. Reasoning that an instrument would perform best if it were underpinned by a clearly conceptualized link between environment and learning as well as psychometric evidence, we developed the mixed methods Manchester Clinical Placement Index (MCPI), eliminated redundant items, and published validity evidence for its 8 item and 2 subscale structure. Here, we set out to compare MCPI with DREEM. 104 students on full-time clinical placements completed both measures three times during a single academic year. There was good agreement and at least as good discrimination between placements with the smaller MCPI. Total MCPI scores and the mean score of its 5-item learning environment subscale allowed ten raters to distinguish between the quality of educational environments. Twenty raters were needed for the 3-item MCPI training subscale and the DREEM scale and its subscales. MCPI compares favourably with DREEM in that one-sixth the number of items perform at least as well psychometrically, it provides formative free text data, and it is founded on the widely shared assumption that communities of practice make good learning environments. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941357820"

Although the testing effect is among the most robust findings in cognitive science, much of its empirical support is from laboratory studies and it has been applied as a strategy for enhancing learning in the classroom in a limited fashion. The purpose of this investigation was to replicate the testing effect in a university anatomy and physiology course and to extend the applicability of it to independent student study. Students repeatedly studied three sets of passages that described structures and concepts pertaining to (1) cardiac electrophysiology, (2) ventilation and (3) endocrinology. Each student was randomly assigned to study one of those three passage sets by reading it three consecutive times (R–R–R), another by reading and then rereading it while taking notes (R–R + N) and the third by reading it, recalling as much as possible (i.e., self-testing) and then rereading it (R–T–R). Retention assessed after 1 week was significantly greater following R–T–R (53.95 ± 1.72) compared to R–R–R (48.04 ± 1.83) and R–R + N (48.31 ± 1.78). Evidence is also presented that suggests students benefited from instructions to self-test when preparing for exams on their own. The testing effect, then, can be generalized to real-life settings such as university anatomy and physiology courses and to independent study situations. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84929841981"

The aim of this paper is to illustrate what I have learned from the research I have been involved in, in such a way that it enables other researchers, educators, and clinicians to understand and study practice-based learning in healthcare workplaces. Therefore, I build on a programmatic line of research to present a framework of practice-based learning consisting of three inextricably linked levels of analysis. The first level focuses on how situations lead to personal experiences, the second level looks at strings of experiences that lead to multiple trajectories, and the third level deals with reifications arising from recurrent activities.

Such known-groups comparison studies provide validity evidence of “relationships with other variables.” The typical education research study might compare scores between staff physicians and postgraduate trainees with the hypothesis that those with more advanced training (the “experts”) will have higher scores than those less advanced (the “novices”). However, such comparisons are too nonspecific to support clear conclusions, and expert-novice comparisons (and known-groups comparisons in general) thus contribute little to the validity argument. The major flaw is the problem of confounding: there are multiple plausible explanations for any observed between-group differences. The absence of hypothesized differences would suggest a serious flaw in the validity argument, but the confirmation of such differences adds little. As such, accurate known-groups discrimination may be necessary, but will never be sufficient, to support the validity of scores.

Three experiments assessed student auscultation performance following instructional manipulations of the three primary components of cognitive load: intrinsic, extraneous, and germane load. Study 1 evaluated the impact of intrinsic cognitive load by varying the number of diagnoses learned in one instruction session; Study 2 evaluated the impact of extraneous cognitive load by providing students with single or multiple examples of diagnoses during instruction; and Study 3 evaluated the impact of germane cognitive load by employing mixed or blocked sequences of diagnostic examples to students. Each of the three studies presents results that support CLT as explaining the influence of different types of cognitive processing on auscultation skill acquisition. We conclude with a discussion regarding CLT’s usefulness as a framework for education and education research in the health professions. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941419951"

Feedback on the draft scale was sought and incorporated. 411 medical students and 75 foundation doctors in Exeter, UK were asked to complete the scale. Psychometric analysis enabled further scale refinement and comparison of scale scores across subgroups. The pilot study achieved a 64 % response rate. The final 29 item version of the Tolerance of Ambiguity in Medical Students and Doctors (TAMSAD) scale had good internal reliability (Cronbach’s α 0.80). Tolerance of ambiguity was higher in foundation year 2 doctors than first, third and fourth year medical students (−5.23, P = 0.012; −5.98, P = 0.013; −4.62, P = 0.035, for each year group respectively). The TAMSAD scale offers a valid and reliable alternative to existing scales. Further work is required in different settings and in longitudinal studies but this study offers intriguing provisional insights. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939893521"

This research was a qualitative descriptive study conducted through face-to-face interviews with nursing students. Content analysis was used to analyze the data. The results indicate that the teachers’ empathy towards students and their learning either produces a constructive learning experience and a caring learning environment or obstructs their learning and has negative consequences for a student’s quality of life. Empathy from teachers towards the students when becoming a nurse facilitates professional education and offers potential strength-based learning; on the other hand, it can hinder the learning of correct principles of nursing care and challenges students stay true to their personal principles. The results indicate that empathy has a positive impact on students’ professional development in nursing and their learning environment. Teachers should be strongly encouraged to place a greater emphasis on the principle of empathy and caring in nursing, which would involve having good communication with students. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937629725"

There have been a number of calls for greater attention to ethics education within health science curricula. This study investigated occupational therapy students’ perceptions of the meaning of ethical practice as a means of engaging in a dialogue about the aims of ethics education in contemporary health science contexts. A phenomenological methodological approach was adopted for the study. Interviews were conducted over 2 years with 25 student participants. The data were analyzed using phenomenological methods of analysis. Seven themes depict students’ views about the meaning of ethical practice and include: being faithful to the tenets of your practice, being communicative, being in tune with your values, understanding the client’s needs, weighing the pros and cons, negotiating the grey zones, and taking time to reflect. The findings contribute to understanding students’ conceptions of the meaning of ethical practice that include and move beyond traditional codes, principles, and professional standards to encompass a range of dimensions of ethical practice. These additional dimensions raise insights of relevance to those who design and facilitate ethics education with health professionals. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937639480"

Empathy in its cognitive (perspective-taking) and affective forms has been well-studied in the literature and in fact, is shown in most studies to decline during undergraduate and graduate medical education. Empathy has also been shown to be inversely proportional to one’s sense of power (SOP) in the business literature. In addition, the relationship of empathy to personality traits has not been examined. This cross-sectional study of four cohorts of undergraduate medical students at a private mid-Atlantic medical school compares the empathy of first, second, third and fourth year medical students to see if there is a decline across the medical school experience. It also examines the relationship among empathy, SOP and personality type across the 4 years of medical school. Unlike in many previous studies, we found no decline in student empathy. We found no significant relationship between SOP and empathy. Finally, there were no significant differences in power perception and personality measures across all educational years surveyed. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896589804"

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, Web of Science, Scopus, and selected reference lists through February 2013. Working in duplicate, we selected original research articles in any language evaluating the OSATS as an assessment tool for any health professional. We iteratively and collaboratively extracted validity evidence from included articles to construct and evaluate the validity argument for varied uses of the OSATS. Twenty-nine articles met the inclusion criteria, all focussed on surgical technical skills assessment. We identified three intended uses for the OSATS, namely formative feedback, high-stakes assessment and program evaluation. Following Kane’s framework, four inferences in the validity argument were examined (scoring, generalization, extrapolation, decision). For formative feedback and high-stakes assessment, there was reasonable evidence for scoring and extrapolation. However, for high-stakes assessment there was a dearth of evidence for generalization aside from inter-rater reliability data and an absence of evidence linking multi-station OSATS scores to performance in real clinical settings. For program evaluation, the OSATS validity argument was supported by reasonable generalization and extrapolation evidence. There was a complete lack of evidence regarding implications and decisions based on OSATS scores. In general, validity evidence supported the use of the OSATS for formative feedback. Research to provide support for decisions based on OSATS scores is required if the OSATS is to be used for higher-stakes decisions and program evaluation. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947019597"

The study examined (1) what health professions students learn about professional language and communication when given the opportunity, in an interprofessional group with a patient or client, to explore the uses, meanings, and effects of common health care terms, and (2) how health professional students write about their experience of discussing common health care terms, and what this reveals about how students see their development of professional discourse and participation in a professional discourse community. Using qualitative thematic analysis to address the first question, the study found that discussion of these health care terms provoked learning and reflection on how words commonly used in one health profession can be understood quite differently in other health professions, as well as on how health professionals’ language choices may be perceived by patients and clients. Using discourse analysis to address the second question, the study further found that many of the students emphasized accuracy and certainty in language through clear definitions and intersubjective agreement. However, when prompted by the discussion they were willing to consider other functions and effects of language. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941424422"

Research evidence shows that feedback does not always improve learning and its effects may be small. In many studies, a variety of variables involved in feedback provision may mask either one of their effects. E.g., there is reason to believe that the way oral feedback is framed may affect its effect if other variables are held constant. In a randomised controlled trial we investigated the effect of positively and negatively framed feedback messages on satisfaction, self-efficacy, and performance. A single blind randomised controlled between-subject design was used, with framing of the feedback message (positively–negatively) as independent variable and examination of hearing abilities as the task. First year medical students’ (n = 59) satisfaction, self-efficacy, and performance were the dependent variables and were measured both directly after the intervention and after a 2 weeks delay. Students in the positively framed feedback condition were significantly more satisfied and showed significantly higher self-efficacy measured directly after the performance. Effect sizes found were large, i.e., partial η2 = 0.43 and η2 = 0.32 respectively. They showed a better performance throughout the whole study. Significant performance differences were found both at the initial performance and when measured 2 weeks after the intervention: effects were of medium size, respectively r = −.31 and r = −.32. Over time in both conditions performance and self-efficacy decreased. Framing the feedback message in either a positive or negative manner affects students’ satisfaction and self-efficacy directly after the intervention be it that these effects seem to fade out over time. Performance may be enhanced by positive framing, but additional studies need to confirm this. We recommend using a positive frame when giving feedback on clinical skills. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937637020"

Although the social variance in how physicians and patients communicate is clearly demonstrated, little is known about what patients with different educational attainments actually prefer in doctor–patient communication. In this study we describe patients’ perspective in doctor–patient communication according to their educational level, and to what extent these perspectives lean towards the expert opinion on doctor–patient communication. In a multi-center study (Belgium, The Netherlands, UK and Italy), focus group discussions were organised using videotaped medical consultations. A mixed methods approach was used to analyse the data. Firstly, a difference in perspective in communication style was found between the lower educated participants versus the middle and higher educated participants. Secondly, lower educated participants referred positively most to aspects related to the affective/emotional area of the medical consultation, followed by the task-oriented/problem-focused area. Middle and higher educated participants positively referred most to the task-oriented/problem-focused area. The competency of the physician was an important category of communication for all participants, independent of social background. The results indicate that the preferences of lower educated participants lean more towards the expert opinion in doctor–patient communication than the middle and higher educated participants. Patients’ educational level seems to influence their perspective on communication style and should be taken into account by physicians.

Its effect on construct validity and reliability of progress test scores, is subject of discussion. Choosing a DKO may not only be affected by knowledge level, but also by risk taking tendency, and may thus introduce construct-irrelevant variance into the knowledge measurement. On the other hand, FS may result in more reliable test scores. To evaluate the impact of FS on construct validity and reliability of progress test scores, a progress test for radiology residents was divided into two tests of 100 parallel items (A and B). Each test had a FS and a number-right (NR) version, A-FS, B-FS, A-NR, and B-NR. Participants (337) were randomly divided into two groups. One group took test A-FS followed by B-NR, and the second group test B-FS followed by A-NR. Evidence for impaired construct validity was sought in a hierarchical regression analysis by investigating how much of the participants’ FS-score variance was explained by the DKO-score, compared to the contribution of the knowledge level (NR-score), while controlling for Group, Gender, and Training length. Cronbach’s alpha was used to estimate NR and FS-score reliability per year group. NR score was found to explain 27 % of the variance of FS [F(1,332) = 219.2, p < 0.0005], DKO-score, and the interaction of DKO and Gender were found to explain 8 % [F(2,330) = 41.5, p < 0.0005], and the interaction of DKO and NR 1.6 % [F(1,329) = 16.6, p < 0.0005], supporting our hypothesis that FS introduces construct-irrelevant variance into the knowledge measurement. However, NR-scores showed considerably lower reliabilities than FS-scores (mean year-test group Cronbach’s alphas were 0.62 and 0.74, respectively). Decisions about FS with progress tests should be a careful trade-off between systematic and random measurement error. © 2015, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947042864"

Current published data are insufficient to assess whether such work hour restrictions will have long-term impact on residents’ education. We searched computer-generated reports of hospital in-patient census, continuity clinic census, in-training exam scores and first-year resident attendance at educational conferences for the academic years 2010–2011 (August 1, 2010—May 31, 2011) and 2011–2013 (August 1, 2011—May 31, 2013). During the first year of the study period, the residents’ inpatient internal medicine services admitted 1,754 patients; during this same period for academic years 2011–2012 and 2012–2013, the teaching services admitted 1,539 and 1,428 patients respectively, yielding a decrease of 16.4 %. Monthly, these services cared for a mean of 27.1 (27.1/175.4 [15.4 %]) fewer patients and 9.7 (9.7/34.4 [28.2 %]) fewer patients per intern than in the previous year. No statistical difference was observed regarding continuity clinic attendance and in-training exam scores. Residents in the years following work hours restrictions attended more educational conferences. Implementation of 2011 ACGME work hour regulations resulted in fewer patients seen by first-year residents in hospital, but did not affect in-training exam scores. Whether these findings will translate into differences in patient outcomes, and quality of care remains to be seen. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939881947"

This study sought to compare the relative contributions of ethnicity and English proficiency, and to do so in a context where students had not been selected via interviews or some other proxy for language proficiency. Ethnicity, citizenship, and demographic data, as well as academic performance and progress were obtained for three successive cohorts (entering in 2007, 2008 and 2009) into a three-year pharmacy programme, following a common first-year. Complete data was available for all 297 students entering via this path. By the end of the programme, controlling for grades at entry, students from some non-local ethnic backgrounds (p < .001) underperformed local students, as did males (p < .001) and those who had been identified as having low English proficiency in year 1 (p < .01). Males (p < .01) and one non-local ethnic group (p < .01) were also more likely to have to repeat a year of study. Ethnicity was a stronger predictor than English proficiency or acculturation, but English proficiency was still independently and additively predictive. This suggests that targeted support strategies for students with lower English language proficiency are still important, but that cultural differences should not be underestimated. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939883720"

They solved a new set of four different cases (transfer cases) also 1 week later. For training cases, students improved significantly their diagnostic performance overtime but the main effect of group was not significant suggesting that students’ SE mainly drives the observed effect.

The purpose of this study was to develop, implement, and gather validity evidence for a procedural skills objective structured clinical examination (PS-OSCE) for internal medicine (IM) residents to assess their technical and non-technical skills when performing procedures. Thirty-five first to third-year IM residents participated in a 5-station PS-OSCE, which combined partial task models, standardized patients, and allied health professionals. Formal blueprinting was performed and content experts were used to develop the cases and rating instruments. Examiners underwent a frame-of-reference training session to prepare them for their rater role. Scores were compared by levels of training, experience, and to evaluation data from a non-procedural OSCE (IM-OSCE). Reliability was calculated using Generalizability analyses. Reliabilities for the technical and non-technical scores were 0.68 and 0.76, respectively. Third-year residents scored significantly higher than first-year residents on the technical (73.5 vs. 62.2 %) and non-technical (83.2 vs. 75.1 %) components of the PS-OSCE (p < 0.05). Residents who had performed the procedures more frequently scored higher on three of the five stations (p < 0.05). There was a moderate disattenuated correlation (r = 0.77) between the IM-OSCE and the technical component of the PS-OSCE scores. The PS-OSCE is a feasible method for assessing multiple competencies related to performing procedures and this study provides validity evidence to support its use as an in-training examination. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939890447"

Learner-generated schemas are an alternative, but may be limited by increases in cognitive load. We compared expert- and learner-generated schemas for learning ECG rhythm interpretation on diagnostic accuracy, cognitive load and knowledge acquisition. Fifty-seven medical students were randomized to two experiments. Experiment 1 (n = 29) compared use of traditional teaching frameworks to expert generated schemas. Participants randomly received either a traditional framework or an expert-generated schema to practice each of two content areas in a crossed design.

Using the same methodology, experiment 2 (n = 28) compared use of learner-generated versus expert-generated schemas. In experiment 1, learning from expert-generated schemas was associated with lower cognitive load (13 vs 16, p < 0.001), higher diagnostic accuracy on immediate testing (40 vs 29 %, p = 0.018), and higher discriminating knowledge (81 vs 71 %, p < 0.001).

Different from most research on the subject, this study attempted to combine the sociological perspective of college impact with a psychological perspective to synthetically explore the causal relationship of specific types of self-concept and college involvement with academic success of medical students. A longitudinal study was conducted using 519 matriculates at a medical university in mainland China. We conducted the Cooperative Institutional Research Program freshmen survey and the Your First College Year survey to collect data of the pre-college and college academic and social self-concept, college involvement components, and some input characteristics. The academic success was measured by the first-year grade point average. A pathway analysis was conducted and showed the following results. Having high academic self-concept, being engaged in class and putting effort in homework or study directly contributes to increasing college achievement.

However, it is also a time of increased stress for students. A student’s perception of stressors and their capacity to effectively manage them is a legitimate concern for educators, because anxiety and decreased coping strategies can interfere with effective learning, clinical performance and capacity to care for patients. Resilience is emerging as a valuable construct to underpin positive coping strategies for learning and professional practice. We report the development and evaluation of a psycho-education resilience program designed to build practical skills-based resilience capacities in health science (physiotherapy) students. Six final year undergraduate physiotherapy students attended four action research sessions led by a clinical health psychologist. Resilience strategies drawn from cognitive behavioural therapy, and positive and performance psychology were introduced. Students identified personal learning stressors and their beliefs and responses. They chose specific resilience-based strategies to address them, and then reported their impact on learning performance and experiences. Thematic analysis of the audio-recorded and transcribed action research sessions, and students’ de identified notes was conducted. Students’ initial descriptions of stressors as ‘problems’ outside their control resulting in poor thinking and communication, low confidence and frustration, changed to a focus on how they managed and recognized learning challenges as normal or at least expected elements of the clinical learning environment. The research suggests that replacing stressful challenges with positive coping strategies offers a potentially powerful tool to build self-efficacy and cognitive control as well as greater self-awareness as a learner and future health practitioner. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947030268"

Mentoring is often executed ad hoc; there are limited programs to train faculty to become more effective mentors, and the few that exist have a dearth of empirical support of their impact. In 2013, we recruited 34 faculty from across the US engaged in HIV-related clinical research to participate in a 2-day Mentoring the Mentors workshop. The workshop included didactic and interactive content focused on a range of topics, such as mentor–mentee communication, leadership styles, emotional intelligence, understanding the impact of diversity (unconscious bias, microaggressions, discrimination, tokenism) for mentees, and specific tools and techniques for effective mentoring. Pre- and post-workshop online evaluations documented high rates of satisfaction with the program and statistically significant improvements in self-appraised mentoring skills (e.g. addressing diversity in mentoring, communication with mentees, aligning mentor–mentee expectations), as assessed via a validated mentoring competency tool. This is the first mentoring training program focused on enhancing mentors’ abilities to nurture investigators of diversity, filling an important gap, and evaluation results offer support for its effectiveness. Results suggest a need for refinement and expansion of the program and for more comprehensive, long-term evaluation of distal mentoring outcomes for those who participate in the program. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937642963"

We have designed simple mechanical devices which, along with existing simulators, enable all the main dysfunctions which have diagnostic value in spirometry to be simulated and clearly explained with visual and haptic feedback. We modelled the airways as Starling resistors by a clearly visible mechanical action to simulate intra- and extra-thoracic obstruction. A narrow tube was used to simulate fixed large airway obstruction and inelastic bands to simulate restriction. We hypothesized that using simulators whose action explains disease promotes learning especially in higher domain educational objectives. The main features of obstruction and restriction were correctly simulated. Simulation of variable extra-thoracic obstruction caused blunting and plateauing of inspiratory flow, and simulation of intra-thoracic obstruction caused limitation of expiratory flow with marked dynamic compression. Multiple choice tests were created with questions allocated to lower (remember and understand) or higher cognitive domains (apply, analyse and evaluate). In a cross-over design, overall mean scores increased after 1½ h simulation spirometry (43–68 %, effect size 1.06, P < 0.0001). In higher cognitive domains the mean score was lower before and increased further than lower domains (Δ 30 vs 20 %, higher vs lower effect size 0.22, P < 0.05). In conclusion, the devices successfully simulate various patterns of obstruction and restriction. Using these devices medical students achieved marked enhancement of learning especially in higher cognitive domains. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941419748"

Professional regulatory bodies now require undergraduate medical schools to implement an ‘assistantship’ period in the final year of study, where senior medical students ‘shadow’ the work of junior doctors, with an expectation that they will be better ‘prepared’ for work. However, there is little guidance about what an ‘assistantship’ entails and the current emphasis on preparedness of students arguably underplays the importance of contextualised learning within the workplace environment. This paper will describe a modified Development Work Research (DWR) (Engeström in Developmental work research: activity theory in practice. Lehmanns Media, Berlin, 2005) approach to organisational change, enabling academic, clinical and administrative partners to develop assistantship placements in different hospitals. Our findings indicate that a modified DWR approach can reveal factors indicating organisational readiness to support change within a locally contextualised framework.

This sometimes leads to the interpretation that quantitative features of a program are of less importance, such as procedures practiced and weeks or months spent in clinical practice. An educational philosophy like “We don’t require numbers of procedures completed but focus on competencies” suggests a dichotomy of either competency-based or time and procedures based education. The author argues that this dichotomy is not useful, and may even compromise education, as long as valid assessment of all relevant competencies is not possible or feasible.

When feedback is provided in a summative context, it is not always used effectively by learners. In this study we explored the reasons for this. We conducted individual interviews with 17 students who had recently received web based feedback following a summative assessment. Constant comparative analysis was conducted for recurring themes. The summative assessment culture, with a focus on avoiding failure, was a dominant and negative influence on the use of feedback. Strong emotions were prevalent throughout the period of assessment and feedback, which reinforced the focus on the need to pass, rather than excel. These affective factors were heightened by interactions with others. The influence of prior learning experiences affected expectations about achievement and the need to use feedback. The summative assessment and subsequent feedback appeared disconnected from future clinical workplace learning. Socio-cultural influences and barriers to feedback need to be understood before attempting to provide feedback after all assessments. A move away from the summative assessment culture may be needed in order to maximise the learning potential of assessments. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939875045"

We aimed to expand our understanding of the role motivation plays within communication skills training by investigating whether motivation precedes or, conversely, follows psychosocial attributes. According to goal orientations theory, motivation denotes the goals students pursue when engaging in learning tasks. We hypothesized that goal orientations would predict development of psychosocial attributes. More specifically, an adaptive goal orientation (i.e., mastery goal orientation) was expected to predict perceived psychosocial abilities, whereas the maladaptive goal orientations (i.e., performance-approach and avoidance goal orientations) were hypothesized to predict LFT (frustration intolerance). The study spanned two sequential years, in which two cohorts of first-year medical students (N = 151) completed questionnaires at the beginning and end of an annual physician-patient communication course. The questionnaires assessed goal orientations, perceived psychosocial abilities, and LFT. Cross-lagged analyses using Structural Equation Modeling indicated that goal orientations significantly predicted perceived psychosocial abilities, as hypothesized; however, LFT predicted maladaptive goal orientation, rather than the other way around. These findings provided further support for the contribution of goal orientations theory within medical education contexts.

Nineteen Family Medicine residents were recruited as standardized patients (FMR–SPs) for a mandatory palliative care workshop in communication for incoming, first-year trainees. Four months later, FMR–SPs reflected upon their own experiences. Two independent researchers performed thematic analysis of these interviews. Most of the residents were satisfied with their roles. Twelve reported improved understanding of self, their patients, the doctor–patient relationship, and the underlying philosophy of palliative care. They also described improved verbal and non-verbal communication skills. Eleven of 14 residents reflected upon behavioral changes in problem coping styles. All residents indicated an intention to apply the learning in their future work.

There is limited research that has compared the effect of low and high-fidelity manikin simulators for NRP learning outcomes, and more specifically on teamwork performance and confidence. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of using low versus high-fidelity manikin simulators in NRP instruction. A randomized posttest-only control group study design was conducted. Third year undergraduate medical students participated in NRP instruction and were assigned to an experimental group (high-fidelity manikin simulator) or control group (low-fidelity manikin simulator). Integrated skills station (megacode) performance, participant satisfaction, confidence and teamwork behaviour scores were compared between the study groups. Participants in the high-fidelity manikin simulator instructional group reported significantly higher total scores in overall satisfaction (p = 0.001) and confidence (p = 0.001). There were no significant differences in teamwork behaviour scores, as observed by two independent raters, nor differences on mandatory integrated skills station performance items at the p < 0.05 level. Medical students’ reported greater satisfaction and confidence with high-fidelity manikin simulators, but did not demonstrate overall significantly improved teamwork or integrated skills station performance. Low and high-fidelity manikin simulators facilitate similar levels of objectively measured NRP outcomes for integrated skills station and teamwork performance. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939893909"

This information is important as it will assist optometry institutions to formulate effective student recruitment strategies. To assess the demographic characteristics of Ghanaian optometry students, the factors that influence their selection of optometry as a career and institution of learning. We conducted a cross sectional study among Ghanaian optometry students using a structured questionnaire to collect data on the demographic characteristics and factors that might influence their choice of optometry as a career as well as choice of institution of learning. Two hundred and eighty students from the two optometry training institutions in Ghana; University of Cape Coast (48.2 %) and Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (51.8 %) responded to the questionnaire. Their ages ranged from 17 to 28 years with most being males (72.5 %), and the majority (79 %) being from urban areas. The main factors that influenced their career choice were job availability after graduation (90 %) and desire to help other people (89.2 %). Factors that influenced their institution choice were preference for an institution (36.8 %) and proximity to home (24.4 %). In the absence of adequate optometry jobs in the public health sector, women will remain marginalised specifically those in rural areas. This marginalisation is however, a reflection of a broader societal disadvantage for women. Greater effort needs to be made to recruit high school students from rural areas to study optometry and more institutions need to provide optometry instruction throughout the country. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939885972"

According to the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing, validation involves the integration of data from well-defined classifications of evidence. In the authoritative framework, data from all classifications support construct validity claims. The two aims of this study were to develop a categorization method for validity evidence published in support of surgery performance assessments and to summarize the results of applying this methodology to the gynecologic surgery literature. This was a critical analysis of published observations reported as validity evidence in studies with a construct validity claim. Medline and Embase databases were searched using keywords: “surgery” and “construct validity”. Parameters included English-language articles published from 2000 to 2012. Gynecologic studies were analyzed for definitions of construct validity and nonstandard terminology. Categorization criteria were developed and applied by the researchers to all observations. Two independent evaluators examined reported observations for compliance with guidelines provided by the Standards. Inter-rater agreement was calculated using weighted kappa. The initial search returned 167 articles. Twenty-five articles were left for inclusion in our analysis. Eighteen (72 %) articles defined construct validity as the ability to discriminate between expert and novice levels of proficiency. Within the sample, 80 discrete observations of reported validity evidence were identified and categorized according to standard classifications. Nearly 30 % of all published observations intended to demonstrate differences in performance by level of proficiency, 25 % described a scoring model, and 14 % demonstrated support of assessment content. Not one article contained a statistical correlation between assessment scores and objective outcomes from the authentic surgical environment. Medians for level of rigor ranged from 0 to 1 across all forms of evidence. Weighted kappa values ranged 0.60–0.91. Validity claims in gynecologic surgical assessment over-rely on generalizability evidence. No test-criterion evidence was observed. Increased awareness of current standards and systematic argument development is needed for gynecologic performance assessments. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937634547"

The purpose of this article is to explore how performance appraisal in daily medical practice is experienced and might affect the influx of cultural minority physicians into specialty training. A critical diversity study was completed in one academic hospital using interviews (N = 27) and focus groups (15 participants) with cultural minority physicians and residents, instructing specialists and executives of medical wards. Data were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic and integral content analysis was performed. In addition to explicit norms on high motivation and excellent performance, implicit norms on professionalism are considered crucial in qualifying for specialty training. Stereotyped imaging on the culture and identity of cultural minority physicians and categorical thinking on diversity seem to underlie daily processes of evaluation and performance appraisal. These are experienced as inhibiting the possibilities to successfully profile for selection into residency and specialist positions. Implicit criteria appear to affect selection processes on medical wards and possibly hinder the influx of cultural minority physicians into residency and making academic hospitals more diverse. Minority and majority physicians, together with the hospital management and medical education should target inclusive norms and practices within clinical practice. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941360932"

Practicing multiple concepts together (mixed practice mode) has been shown superior to practicing concepts separately (blocked practice mode) for transfer. This study examined the effect of single and multiple practice contexts for both mixed and blocked practice modalities on transfer performance. We looked at performance on near transfer (familiar contexts) cases and far transfer (unfamiliar contexts) cases. First year psychology students (n = 42) learned three physiological concepts in a 2 × 2 factorial study (one or two practice contexts and blocked or mixed practice). Each concept was practiced with two clinical cases; practice context was defined as the number of organ systems used (one system per concept vs. two systems). In blocked practice, two practice cases followed each concept; in mixed practice, students learned all concepts before seeing six practice cases. Transfer testing consisted of correctly classifying and explaining 15 clinical cases involving near and far transfer. The outcome was ratings of quality of explanations on a 0–3 scale. The repeated measures analysis showed a significant near versus far by organ system interaction [F(1,38) = 3.4, p < 0.002] with practice with a single context showing lower far transfer scores than near transfer [0.58 (0.37)–0.83 (0.37)] compared to the two contexts which had similar far and near transfer scores [1.19 (0.50)–1.01 (0.38)]. Practicing with two organ contexts had a significant benefit for far transfer regardless of mixed or blocked practice; the single context mixed practice group had the lowest far transfer performance; this was a large effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.81). Using only one practice context during practice significantly lowers performance even with the usually superior mixed practice mode. Novices should be exposed to multiple contexts and mixed practice to facilitate transfer. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941423914"

Self-directed practice is resource-efficient and flexible; however, insight into technical proficiency among trainees is often lacking. The purpose of this study is to prospectively assess the accuracy of self-assessments among medical students learning basic surgical suturing. Over seven weekly practice sessions, preclinical medical students performed serial repetitions of a simulation-based suturing task under one-on-one observation by one of four trainers. Following each task repetition, self- and trainer-assessments (SA–TA) were performed using a 36-point weighted checklist of technical standards developed a priori by expert consensus. Upon study completion, agreement between SA and TA was measured using weighted Cohen’s kappa coefficients. Twenty-nine medical students each performed a median of 25 suture task repetitions (IQR 21.5–28). Self-assessments tended to overestimate proficiency during the first tertile of practice attempts. Agreement between SA and TA improved with experience, such that the weighted kappa statistics for the two-handed and instrument ties were >0.81 after 18–21 task attempts. Inexperienced trainees frequently overestimate technical proficiency through self-assessments. However, this bias diminishes with repetitive practice. Only after trainees have attained the capacity to accurately self-assess can effective self-directed learning take place. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939886493"

As many of these studies have reached no clear conclusions on the superiority of the PBL approach, the effect of curricular reform on student performance remains an issue. We employed a theoretical framework that integrates antecedents of student achievement from various psychosocial domains to examine how students interact with their curricular environment. In a longitudinal study with N = 1,646 participants, we assessed students in a traditional and a PBL-centered curriculum. The measures administered included students’ perception of the learning environment, self-efficacy beliefs, positive study-related affect, social support, indicators of self-regulated learning, and academic achievement assessed through progress tests. We compared the relations between these characteristics in the two curricular environments. The results are two-fold. First, substantial relations of various psychosocial domains and their associations with achievement were identified. Second, our analyses indicated that there are no substantial differences between traditional and PBL-based curricula concerning the relational structure of psychosocial variables and achievement. Drawing definite conclusions on the role of curricular-level interventions in the development of student’s academic achievement is constrained by the quasi-experimental design as wells as the selection of variables included.

Twenty-two medical students participated in this longitudinal case study. Students had similar preclinical and post-MCY experiences but different MCY experiences (rotational vs. longitudinal tracks). We interviewed students every 6 months in the preclinical phase, mid-way through MCY, and 7–8 months before graduation (101 total interviews). We inductively created codes, iteratively revised codes to best-fit the data, and thematically clustered codes into Bourdieu-informed categories: field (social structures), capital (resources) and habitus (dispositions). We found that students acclimated to shifts in the UME field as they moved through medical school: from medical school itself to the health system and back. To successfully navigate transitions, students learned to secure capital as medical knowledge and social connections in the preclinical and preparation for residency phases, and as reputable patient care and being noticed in the clinical phase. To obtain capital, and be well-positioned for the next phase of training, students consistently relied on dispositions of initiative and flexibility. In summary, students experience the complex context of medical school through a series of transitions. Efforts to improve UME would be well-served by greater awareness of the social structures (field) that students encounter, the resources to which they afford value (capital), and the dispositions which aid acquisition of these resources (habitus). © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941413319"

We believe this is an over simplification of what is required to be a competent surgeon. This work aims to illuminate the attributes of a mature, competent, thinking surgeon. A bespoke (or custom) tailor is highly trained craftsman who produces unique items of clothing to the customers’ requirements. This paper uses the practice of expert bespoke tailoring as a metaphor for illuminating surgical training and practice. A sustained and evolving dialogue with a single eminent tailor identified a number of emergent themes. A three-year iterative process included wide reading, interviews, observation, discussion and reflection. These emergent themes have produced a provisional working framework for exploring non-technical domains of surgical competence. Surgical practice is a complex process, which interweaves non-technical and technical elements in a seamless harmonious marriage of physical and mental processes. These processes need to be more clearly defined to allow the most effective training of future surgeons in the limited time now available. We discuss the benefits of illuminating these hidden facets of surgical practice, pointing out the limitations of defining competency in terms of knowledge acquisition and technical skills. If we are to train balanced, thinking surgeons for future surgical practice, and the training of future surgeons, has to be viewed as a complex integrated process rather than a collection of isolated domains. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939896019"

How best to teach this complex skill has not been clearly delineated. We conducted a randomized trial of the effects of two types of teaching of CVC on skill acquisition and retention. We randomly assigned novice internal medicine residents to learning CVC in-part or in-whole. The part-group was taught the first part of the procedure, followed by practice, followed by being taught the second and final portion of the procedure, and followed by practice. The whole-group was taught the procedure in its entirety, followed by practice. Teaching and practice time for both groups was otherwise held constant. Performances were assessed at baseline, post-training, and at 1 month. The primary outcome was skill retention at 1-month, rated by using a global rating scale and a 22-item checklist, and defined as the score increase between 1-month and baseline. Skill acquisition is defined as the score increase post-training and baseline. Raters were blinded to the participants’ identity, group assignment, and time point. Participants in the part-task group outperformed the whole-task group in skill acquisition (2.2 ± 0.8 vs 1.3 ± 1.0; g = 1.01; p = 0.04) and in skill retention (1.5 ± 0.7 vs 0.5 ± 0.8; g = 1.39; p = 0.006) using the global rating scale. Scores rated by the checklist were not significantly different (52.0 ± 25.3 vs 43.5 ± 23.4; g = 0.33; p = 0.47 for skill acquisition; and 48.5 ± 34.9 vs 41.1 ± 20.4; g = 0.35; p = 0.44 for skill retention). For teaching ultrasound-guided CVC to novice learners, teaching in part is preferable than teaching in whole. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941425097"

Box 616, Maastricht, 6200 MD, Netherlands","The role of workplace supervisors in the clinical education of medical students is currently under debate. However, few studies have addressed how supervisors conceptualize workplace learning and how conceptions relate to current sociocultural workplace learning theory. We explored physician conceptions of: (a) medical student learning in the clinical workplace and (b) how they contribute to student learning. The methodology included a combination of a qualitative, inductive (conventional) and deductive (directed) content analysis approach. The study triangulated two types of interview data from 4 focus group interviews and 34 individual interviews. A total of 55 physicians participated. Three overarching themes emerged from the data: learning as membership, learning as partnership and learning as ownership. The themes described how physician conceptions of learning and supervision were guided by the notions of learning-as-participation and learning-as-acquisition. The clinical workplace was either conceptualized as a context in which student learning is based on a learning curriculum, continuity of participation and partnerships with supervisors, or as a temporary source of knowledge within a teaching curriculum. The process of learning was shaped through the reciprocity between different factors in the workplace context and the agency of students and supervising physicians. A systems-thinking approach merged with the “co-participation” conceptual framework advocated by Billet proved to be useful for analyzing variations in conceptions. The findings suggest that mapping workplace supervisor conceptions of learning can be a valuable starting point for medical schools and educational developers working with changes in clinical educational and faculty development practices. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016510861"

As a result, characteristics of expert behaviour are often described as either cognitive or visual abilities. This study focuses on both aspects of expertise and analyses them along three overarching constructs: (1) encapsulations, (2) efficiency, and (3) hypothesis testing. This study was carried out among clinical pathologists performing an authentic task: diagnosing microscopic slides. Participants were 13 clinical pathologists (experts), 12 residents in pathology (intermediates), and 13 medical students (novices). They all diagnosed seven cases in a virtual microscope and gave post hoc explanations for their diagnoses. The collected data included eye movements, microscope navigation, and verbal protocols. Results showed that experts used lower magnifications and verbalized their findings as diagnoses. Also, their diagnostic paths were more efficient, including fewer microscope movements and shorter reasoning chains. Experts entered relevant areas later in their diagnostic process, and visited fewer of them. Intermediates used relatively high magnifications and based their diagnoses on specific abnormalities. Also, they took longer to reach their diagnosis and checked more relevant areas. Novices searched in detail, described findings by their appearances, and uttered long reasoning chains. These results indicate that overarching constructs can justly be identified: encapsulations and efficiency are apparent in both visual and cognitive aspects of expertise. © 2015, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941424168"

To address this problem, recent studies aimed at helping students cope with stressful situations. Undergraduate students in clinical practice frequently use experiences of surrounding peers to estimate their abilities to master such challenging situations. This use of the experiences of others, known as social comparison, may affect student distress both positively and negatively. To find characteristics of a beneficial use of social comparison, we examined differences in comparison behaviours between students expressing low and high levels of distress. The participants in our study, response rate 93 % (N = 301/321), were all medical students in their first year in clinical practice. They completed the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) to measure distress, and three separate questionnaires to measure: (1) orientation to comparison, (2) motive for comparison, and (3) interpretation of comparison. Differences were analysed using multivariate analysis of variance. Although all students were oriented towards social comparison, the analyses showed that this orientation was less apparent among low-distress students. Besides, the low-distress students were less inclined to use motives indicative for comparisons with peers perceived as performing worse and were less negative in the interpretations of their comparisons. As social comparison is frequently used among all students, we recommend to make them aware of their comparison behaviours and inform them about the pros and cons of the distinguished aspects of the comparison process. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939878243"

Generic assessment instruments help but may also have disadvantages. The generic nature of the skills being assessed does not provide indications for context-specific behaviour required in practice situations; context influences are mostly taken into account implicitly. Our research questions are: 1. What factors do trained raters observe when rating workplace communication? 2. How do they take context factors into account when rating communication performance with a generic rating instrument? Nineteen general practitioners (GPs), trained in communication assessment with a generic rating instrument (the MAAS-Global), participated in a think-aloud protocol reflecting concurrent thought processes while assessing videotaped real-life consultations. They were subsequently interviewed to answer questions explicitly asking them to comment on the influence of predefined contextual factors on the assessment process. Results from both data sources were analysed. We used a grounded theory approach to untangle the influence of context factors on GP communication and on communication assessment. Both from the think-aloud procedure and from the interviews we identified various context factors influencing communication, which were categorised into doctor-related (17), patient-related (13), consultation-related (18), and education-related factors (18). Participants had different views and practices on how to incorporate context factors into the GP(-trainee) communication assessment. Raters acknowledge that context factors may affect communication in GP consultations, but struggle with how to take contextual influences into account when assessing communication performance in an educational context. To assess practice situations, raters need extra guidance on how to handle specific contextual factors. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939892173"

The same cohort of students responded to the same questionnaire, at the end of Year 1 and Year 6. The Chi-square, Mann–Whitney U tests and logistic regression were used in analyses. The results showed that altruistic and scientific reasons were the main motives for choosing a medical career. The motives remained stable over time. The effect of gender on altruistic motivation was stronger at the end of the study, with females’ rating higher. The most favored career paths were associated with non-primary care specializations and work in a hospital. Results of the multivariate logistic regression showed that primary care specializations were more attractive to females, final year students, those from small agglomerations, and those less concerned about high earnings. Preferences regarding sector of work were formed at later stages of training. A preference shift was observed, between Year 1 and Year 6, towards favoring work in the public sector. Predictors of the desire to work in the public sector were: being a male and the final year student, paying less attention to high earnings, wanting certainty of finding work, having a stronger need for interesting and socially important work.

Understanding of PAL has been based on processes and outcomes in controlled settings, such as clinical skills labs. PAL in the clinical setting, a complex learning environment, requires fresh evaluation. Socio-cultural theory is proposed as a means to understand educational interventions in ways that are practical and meaningful. We describe the evaluation of a PAL intervention, introduced to support students’ transition into full time clinical attachments, using activity theory and activity systems analysis (ASA). Our research question was How does PAL transfer to the clinical environment? Junior students on their first clinical attachments undertook a weekly same-level, reciprocal PAL activity. Qualitative data was collected after each session, and focus groups (n = 3) were held on completion. Data was analysed using ASA. ASA revealed two competing activity systems on clinical attachment; Learning from Experts, which students saw as the primary function of the attachment and Learning with Peers, the PAL intervention. The latter took time from the first and was in tension with it. Tensions arose from student beliefs about how learning takes place in clinical settings, and the importance of social relationships, leading to variable engagement with PAL. Differing perspectives within the group were opportunities for expansive learning. PAL in the clinical environment presents challenges specific to that context. Using ASA helped to describe student activity on clinical attachment and to highlight tensions and contradictions relating PAL in that setting. Planning learning opportunities on clinical placements, must take account of how students learn in workplaces, and the complexity of the multiple competing activity systems related to learning and social activities. © 2014, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937579872"

As self-regulated learning has many inaccuracies, the need to support self-regulated learning has been recommended. Supervisors can provide such support. In a prior study trainees reported on the variation in received supervisor support. This study aims at exploring supervisors’ perspectives. The aim is to explore how supervisors experience self-regulated learning of postgraduate general practitioners (GP) trainees and their role in this, and what helps and hinders them in supervising. In a qualitative study using a phenomenological approach, we interviewed 20 supervisors of first- and third-year postgraduate GP trainees. Supervisors recognised trainee activity in self-regulated learning and adapted their coaching style to trainee needs, occasionally causing conflicting emotions. Supervisors’ beliefs regarding their role, trainees’ role and the usefulness of educational interventions influenced their support. Supervisors experienced a relation between patient safety, self-regulated learning and trainee capability to learn. Supervisor training was helpful to exchange experience and obtain advice. Supervisors found colleagues helpful in sharing supervision tasks or in calibrating judgments of trainees. Busy practice occasionally hindered the supervisory process. In conclusion, supervisors adapt their coaching to trainees’ self-regulated learning, sometimes causing conflicting emotions. Patient safety and entrustment are key aspects of the supervisory process. Supervisors’ beliefs about their role and trainees’ role influence their support. Supervisor training is important to increase awareness of these beliefs and the influence on their behaviour, and to improve the use of educational instruments. The results align with findings from other (medical) education, thereby illustrating its relevance. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937562808"

Evaluations are mostly based on questionnaires completed by residents. We investigated to what extent characteristics of residents, clinical teachers, and the clinical environment influenced these evaluations, and the relation between residents’ scores and their teachers’ self-scores. The evaluation and feedback for effective clinical teaching questionnaire (EFFECT) was used to (self)assess clinical teachers from 12 disciplines (15 departments, four hospitals). Items were scored on a five-point Likert scale. Main outcome measures were residents’ mean overall scores (MOSs), specific scale scores (MSSs), and clinical teachers’ self-evaluation scores. Multilevel regression analysis was used to identify predictors. Residents’ scores and self-evaluations were compared. Residents filled in 1,013 questionnaires, evaluating 230 clinical teachers. We received 160 self-evaluations. ‘Planning Teaching’ and ‘Personal Support’ (4.52, SD.61 and 4.53, SD.59) were rated highest, ‘Feedback Content’ (CanMEDS related) (4.12, SD.71) was rated lowest. Teachers in affiliated hospitals showed highest MOS and MSS. Medical specialty did not influence MOS. Female clinical teachers were rated higher for most MSS, achieving statistical significance. Residents in year 1–2 were most positive about their teachers. Residents’ gender did not affect the mean scores, except for role modeling. At group level, self-evaluations and residents’ ratings correlated highly (Kendall’s τ 0.859). Resident evaluations of clinical teachers are influenced by teacher’s gender, year of residency training, type of hospital, and to a lesser extent teachers’ gender. Clinical teachers and residents agree on strong and weak points of clinical teaching. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937552170"

While this is recognized by educators and researchers seeking to develop interventions aimed at improving wellness in health professionals and at providing them with skills to deal with emotional interpersonal situations, the field of health professions education has largely ignored the role that emotions play on cognitive processes. The purpose of this review is to provide an introduction to the broader field of emotions, with the goal of better understanding the integral relationship between emotions and cognitive processes. Individuals, at any given time, are in an emotional state. This emotional state influences how they perceive the world around them, what they recall from it, as well as the decisions they make. Rather than treating emotions as undesirable forces that wreak havoc on the rational being, the field of health professions education could be enriched by a greater understanding of how these emotions can shape cognitive processes in increasingly predictable ways. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937074034"

Multisource feedback (MSF) involves evaluation by peers, patients, and coworkers. Coaching has been identified as a key aspect of MSF with peer coaching involving two or more colleagues working together to reflect on current practices and share ideas. We introduced a pilot MSF and peer coaching program with a goal to evaluate its effect on fostering reflective practice.Methods:Physician participants completed a 360-degree assessment of their practices, followed by peer coaching sessions. Peer coaches were oriented to an evidence-based theory-driven feedback model (R2C2) to support coaching skills development. A mixed-methods evaluation study was undertaken, including pre to post surveys of readiness for self-directed learning, a postevaluation survey of participant satisfaction, and semistructured participant interviews.Results:Thirty four (N = 34) participants completed the 360-degree assessment, and 22 participants took part in two coaching meetings. Respondents reported significant improvement to aspects of their readiness for self-directed learning (P <.05), including knowing about learning strategies to achieve key learning goals, knowing about resources to support one's own learning, and being able to evaluate one's learning outcomes. Overall, respondents felt empowered to ""reflect"" on their practices, affirm what they were doing well, and, for some, identify opportunities for further and ongoing professional development.Discussion:MSF and peer coaching emerged as key elements in enabling reflective practice by facilitating reflection on one's practice and conversations with one's peers to affirm strengths and opportunities for strengthening practice through self-directed professional development. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

However, AMCs face barriers to standard faculty assessment, particularly among large departments with diverse faculty roles. We report on the development, implementation, and utilization of a standardized, web-based faculty annual career review (FACR) process deployed within the Department of Medicine at a large AMC, composed of 22 divisions and 1400 faculty. The FACR process was developed to achieve the following goals: Creation of a trackable review of professional goals and barriers to professional development; provide longitudinal faculty reflection on professional growth; and provide data to identify faculty development needs to target initiatives. The FACR was initiated in 2008. We provide specific case examples of utilization of the FACR data for targeted faculty development initiatives, including (1) division benchmarking; (2) targeting career opportunities to individual faculty members; and (3) longitudinal data analysis of 5-year trends of FACR response, including subanalysis by gender, to target faculty development initiatives across the DOM. In summary, we demonstrate successful development, implementation, and utilization of a web-based standard faculty annual review program within a large AMC that allows for systematic evaluation and reflection of professional development by faculty members and their supervisors and allows for data collection and analysis to help target faculty development initiatives. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

There is little guidance within military service on how to leave careers as clinician educator faculty in graduate medical education programs. The objective of our study was to explore how leaving this community of practice (COP) affects a clinician educator's professional identity.Methods:We used reflexive thematic analysis with Communities of Practice as a sensitizing construct. Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted among active-duty clinician educators at the point of their retirement from the military. Interview questions focused participants' lived experiences as clinician educators and professional identity changes leading to and resulting from the decision to retire.Results:We found the clinician educators' journey through a time of professional transition led to three connected themes: Loss Precedes Growth, Fallow Season - Liminal Space, and New Growth.Discussion:The experiences of military clinician educators retiring from active duty demonstrate how leaving one COP emanates across a range of professional identities. In addition, the decision to leave a professional COP can lead to a sense of disloyalty to that community. Normalizing this transition in a way that honors the community's values offers the opportunity to enable the decision to retire. Understanding retirement as a process that first involves identity loss, followed by the discomfort of a liminal space before achieving new growth creates the opportunity to engage in rituals that celebrate the service of departing community members, releasing them to grow into new identities. © 2024 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.

Family and resident insistence on these preventable transfers has not been thoroughly addressed in transfer reduction programs.Methods:The Diffusion of Innovation model guided dissemination of an evidence-based patient decision guide that addressed resident and family insistence on hospital transfer. Twenty workshops were held across eight states of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Region IV. All Medicare-certified NHs in Region IV received emailed invitations to the workshops in their states. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected on workshop attendees, the facilities they represented, and response to the workshop including adoption of the Guide and its effect on hospital readmissions.Results:Altogether, 1124 facility representatives and affiliated professionals attended the workshops. NH administrators rated the program 4.4 out of 5. Of those who responded, 71% said that they were using the Guide as a result of the workshop; 89% of these said that it was helpful, especially to initiate difficult conversations about end-of-life care and to discuss the care a contemporary NH can provide. Readmission rates dropped 30% in the NHs that reported their results.Discussion:The use of the Diffusion of Innovation model was effective in delivering information to a large number of facilities in sufficient detail to implement the Decision Guide. However, the workshop format provided little opportunity to respond to concerns that arose after the workshops, to diffuse the innovation further, or to build sustainability. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Mentors play a crucial role in this process. This study described mentors' perceived competence in 21 areas of the mentor role and their experiences as mentors following the first year of a structured peer mentoring program.Methods:This study employed a mixed-methods approach, using the Mentoring Competency Assessment-21 alongside open-ended questions. These instruments were electronically administered to a convenience sample consisting of eight mentors with varying experience ranging from 2 to 16 years in the nursing program at a mid-sized university, following an intentional first-year peer mentoring program.Results:The highest-performing items were ""Establishing a relationship based on trust""(M 6.50, SD 0.53), ""Considering how personal and professional differences may impact expectations""(M 6.25, 0.83), and ""Acknowledging your mentee's professional contributions""(M 6.13, SD 0.99). The lowest scores were focused on estimating scientific knowledge and scholarly productivity. Responses to the Mentoring Competency Assessment-21 indicated that mentors felt at least moderately competent in the various aspects of the faculty mentor role. Mentors valued the professional development and supporting materials provided by the development team. An identified area for improvement was the support provided to assist the mentees' scholarly development.Discussion:This study underscores the importance of supportive materials, such as handbooks and regular communication, in fostering mentor competence and facilitating successful nursing faculty peer mentoring programs. Future research implications include assessment of mentor competence by mentees and long-Term follow-up of program outcomes.

The pandemic contributed to a host of stressors for workers because of the need for rapid acquisition of new knowledge and skills to provide best treatment while simultaneously dealing with personal safety, limited resources, staffing shortages, and access to care issues. Concurrently, problems with systemic racial inequality and discrimination became more apparent secondary to difficulties with accessing health care for minorities and other marginalized groups. These problems contributed to many health care professionals experiencing severe moral injury and burnout as they struggled to uphold core values and do their jobs professionally. Some left or disengaged. Others died. As continuing professional development leaders focused on all health professionals, we must act deliberately to address health care professionals’ distress and mental health. We must incorporate wellness and mental health as organizing principles in all we do. We must adopt a new mental model that recognizes the importance of learners’ biopsychosocial functioning and commit to learners’ wellness by developing activities that embrace a biopsychosocial point of view. As educators and influencers, we must demonstrate that the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s fourth aim to improve clinician well-being and safety (2014) and fifth aim to address health equity and the social determinants of health (2021) matter. It is crucial that continuing professional development leaders globally use their resources and relationships to accomplish this imperative call for action. © 2024 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210191661"

The complexities of care, communication with families, and best interest decision-making about medical interventions means there is a need for ongoing training in clinical, social, ethical, and legal aspects. Methods: Using a combination of group discussions, interviews, and questionnaires with learners, this article reports an evaluation of designing and delivering an interprofessional, online work-based course to health care professionals caring for prolonged disorder of consciousness patients. Results: There were challenges for staff uptake because of COVID-19, but engaging with it increased knowledge in defining and diagnosing patients’ conditions, understanding multidisciplinary team roles, communicating with families, and navigating legal and ethical issues. Course participation also enhanced critical and reflective thinking skills, provided a sense of connection to other professionals, and generated plans to improve service provision. Discussion: Online learning that enables health care professionals to engage at their own pace and also come together as an interprofessional community can provide invaluable continuing professional development and help to enhance joined up, holistic patient care. However, achieving this requires significant investment in creating research-led, multimedia, learning materials, and courses that include synchronous and asynchronous delivery to combine flexible study with the opportunity for peer networks to form. It also depends on a commitment from organizations to support staff online continuing professional development. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Data were collected via surveys administered at baseline/pretraining, immediate post-training, and 12-month post-training.Results:Most health care team members (n= 21) reported improvement in their knowledge of available financial (66.7%) and legal resources (86.7%) and ability to address social needs (93.3%), financial needs (93.3%), and facilitate CoC conversations with patients and caregivers (66.7%).Discussion:Improvements in attitudes and behaviors toward engaging in CoC conversations, screenings, and referrals were relatively improved as a result of the training. However, there was a lower positive rate for actual behaviors around routine screening and initiating discussions on out-of-pocket costs, suggesting a need to address barriers. Study findings highlight the importance of interprofessional education in helping health care teams address social determinants of health through effective CoC conversations.

Improving EDIIA competency in health care serves to enhance patient health, staff confidence and well-being, delivery of care, and the broader health care system. There is a gap in the literature as to the efficacy of EDIIA-based PD programs and their individual components. The present article will review available quantitative data pertaining to EDIIA-based PD programs for health care workers as well as their effectiveness.Methods:A scoping review of articles published in the EBSCOhost, MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases was performed. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.Results:A total of 14,316 references were identified with 361 reaching full-text review. A final 36 articles were included in the scoping review with 6552 total participants (72.9% women; 26.9% men; 0.2% nonbinary). EDIIA-based PD interventions were developed around the topics of culture (n = 22), gender (n = 11), sexual orientation (n = 9), indigeneity (n = 6), race (n = 6), ableism (n = 1), and ageism (n = 1).Discussion:Despite an increased interest in developing EDIIA-based PD curricula for health care workers, there are glaring disparities in the quality of care received by marginalized and equity-seeking populations. The present scoping review delineated key features which were associated with increased quantitative efficacy of EDIIA-based PD training programs. Future work should focus on large-scale implementation and evaluation of these interventions across health care sectors and levels of training. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Studies have suggested that self-efficacy may moderate or mediate the relationship between knowledge/competence and performance. Some results have shown that increases in knowledge/competence contributed to increases in self-efficacy. However, clinicians do not always learn something ""new"" when they participate in CE activities; rather, their knowledge or skills may be reinforced. This study examined whether self-efficacy was greater when clinicians reinforced what they already knew compared with when they learned something new. Hierarchical linear modeling was conducted to examine the moderating role of status of knowledge/competence post-CE (reinforced/improved) in the relationship between post-CE knowledge/competence score and self-efficacy across 153 online continuing medical education- and/or CE-certified activities. The hierarchical linear modeling showed that learners with higher post-CE scores have higher post-self-efficacy ratings. Reinforced learners had higher post-CE-self-efficacy ratings than improved learners, controlling for post-CE score. This study contributes to an expanded understanding of the path from CE to practice. There was benefit to self-efficacy for learners who reinforced but did not improve their knowledge/competence. This study also suggests that pre-post questions can be considered part of the learning process. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Continuing education providers are best positioned to teach health care professionals about teamwork. However, health care professionals and continuing education providers largely operate in single-profession–based environments and thus need to change their programs and activities to achieve team improvement education goals. Joint Accreditation (JA) for Interprofessional Continuing Education is designed to advance teamwork to improve quality care through education programs. However, achieving JA requires significant changes to an education program that are multifaceted and complex to implement. Although challenging, implementation of JA is an effective way to advance interprofessional continuing education. Here, we discuss numerous practical strategies that can aid education programs to prepare for and achieve JA, such as attaining organizational alignment and provider adaptation to expand curriculums, reinventing the education planning process, and implementing tools to help manage the joint accredited program.

In this paper, we report the findings of our evaluation of Catalyst. Methods: We used normalization process theory to investigate how Catalyst was contributing to the participants’ understanding and implementation of generalist practice. We conducted 36 interviews and six focus groups investigating the participants’ clinical practice and experience with the program and analyzed data using framework analysis. Results: Establishing a shared language and reframing professional identity helped GPs develop an understanding of their role through generalist lenses. Generalist practice was legitimized by access to scientific evidence and facilitated interactive learning. Integration of scientific, applied knowledge and quality improvement work fostered the enactment of such practice. Structured reflection and research-informed quality improvement projects contributed to the participants’ awareness of the primary care context. Discussion: Knowledge creation activities observed through interactive learning and the integration of different types of knowledge facilitated the implementation of advanced generalist practice. The participants valued the community of practice gained through the program and would come to rely on programs designed to encourage networking and enable peer support. Finally, research-informed quality improvement projects built to analyze problems and monitor solutions are crucial for an early career physician to develop a sense of agency that shapes their primary care practice. © 2024 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201097561"

Our continued reliance on outcomes-based evaluation fails to respect the importance of complexity and the human element of program planning and implementation. Therefore, it is time that the field of CPD embrace complementary approaches to program evaluation that consider the complexity and maturity of programs and their contexts, while providing credible and relevant information to inform strategic decisions regarding the future of a program. Principles-focused evaluation provides a complement to traditional evaluation approaches through the articulation of a program’s values that can be actioned. These “actionable values,” known as principles, become the focus of the evaluation for the purposes of program decision-making. This paper describes how one CPD program, designed as a response to growing opioid-related harms, adopted a principles-focused evaluation to inform ongoing iteration of the program. The process used to design the principles, how the principles are informing the transportability of the program, and implications for CPD evaluation are discussed. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Although simulation is an effective experiential educational strategy, physicians seldom select it for continuing professional development (CPD) for reasons that are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to explore existing evidence on simulation-based CPD and the factors influencing physicians' engagement in simulation-based CPD.Methods:A scoping review of the literature on simulation-based CPD included MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL databases. Studies involving the use of simulation for practicing physicians' CPD were included. Information related to motivations for participating in simulation-based CPD, study objectives, research question(s), rationale(s), reasons for using simulation, and simulation features was abstracted.Results:The search yielded 8609 articles, with 6906 articles undergoing title and abstract screening after duplicate removal. Six hundred sixty-one articles underwent full-text screening. Two hundred twenty-five studies (1993-2021) were reviewed for data abstraction. Only four studies explored physicians' motivations directly, while 31 studies described incentives or strategies used to enroll physicians in studies on simulation-based CPD. Most studies focused on leveraging or demonstrating the utility of simulation for CPD. Limited evidence suggests that psychological safety, direct relevance to clinical practice, and familiarity with simulation may promote future engagement.Discussion:Although simulation is an effective experiential educational method, factors explaining its uptake by physicians as a CPD strategy are unclear. Additional evidence of simulation effectiveness may fail to convince physicians to participate in simulation-based CPD unless personal, social, educational, or contextual factors that shape physicians' motivations and choices to engage in simulation-based CPD are explored. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Yet, many educators are neither involved in nor equipped to conduct quality education research. This gap underscores the continuing education need to guide and train health professions educators to rigorously investigate, prepare, and report their educational research.Methods:A novel session called the Education Research Accelerator was designed to increase knowledge about education research methods and resources and to improve participants' competence and performance in implementing studies. A panel helped prospective researchers develop ideas or advance projects toward completion by offering real-time feedback to pitched ideas; a live audience of learners participated virtually, expanding the impact of the session, facilitating connections, and potentially inspiring other research ideas. The outcomes of the Education Research Accelerator were evaluated immediately after the session and 18 months later.Results:The Education Research Accelerator conferred favorable outcomes for participants' competence in designing education research studies and awareness of using available resources. Long-term follow-up confirmed actual benefits to use effective methodology to advance education research projects and to use resources and connections established in the Education Research Accelerator.Conclusions:Although further study is needed, the Education Research Accelerator model is a novel intervention to enhance learning, forge needed connections, and increase the sophistication of conducting education research.

We implemented a mini-fellowship program to enhance the knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy of preceptors teaching students and applying quality improvement (QI) methods across disciplines and patient care settings. Methods: The design, implementation, and evaluation of the program were informed by the faculty development literature, principles of adult learning, and preceptor needs. The 3-day program included workshops on curriculum design, clinical teaching methods, QI, social determinants of health, cultural humility, and interprofessional teamwork. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods were used including preprogram and postprogram knowledge and self-efficacy surveys, along with end-of-session and program evaluations. Results: Five annual cohorts involving 41 preceptors with varied demographics, professions, and clinical practices completed the mini-fellowship program. Participants’ percentage of items answered correctly on a QI knowledge test increased from 79.2% (pretest) to 85.5% (post-test), a gain of 6.3% (90% CI: 2.9-9.7%; P < .003). The average QI self-efficacy scores improved from 2.64 to 3.82, a gain of 1.18 points on a five-point scale (P < .001). The average education/teaching self-efficacy increased from 2.79 to 3.80 on a five-point scale (P < .001). Ultimately, 94% would recommend the program to other preceptors. Discussion: An interprofessional preceptor development program designed to train clinicians to effectively teach in the clinical setting and to conduct QI projects with students was achievable and effective. This program can serve as a model for academic centers charged with training future health care workers and supporting their community-based preceptors’ training needs. © 2023 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210190239"

Learning science has compiled a set of evidence-based strategies, such as distributed practice, retrieval practice, and interleaving, which are quite relevant to continuing professional development. Spreading out study and practice separated by cognitive breaks (distributed practice), testing oneself to check mastery and memory of previously learned information (retrieval practice), and mixing the learning of separate but associated information (interleaving) represent strategies that are underutilized in continuing professional development. Participants and planners alike can benefit from learning science recommendations to inform their decisions. Elaboration, the subject of this article, is another evidence-based strategy that relates to how one studies or practices priority information.  © 2024 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208016071"

The purpose of this review was to identify significant components in the field of conflict with particular attention to conceptual findings that may be integrated into understanding interprofessional health care team conflict and its resolution. Methods: A critical review of the conflict literature across many fields was undertaken using the method identified by Grant and Booth, incorporating literature—search, appraisal, synthesis, and analysis. Results: This critical review explored existing models and schools of thought to provide an overview of how conflict is conceptualized, its focus on interpersonal and workplace issues, team conflict application and training in team conflict resolution, and finally a summary of this review’s contribution to interprofessional health care team conflict and its resolution. Conclusions: Team conflict is comprised of three forms—relationship, task, and process. When team building occurs that incorporates training in the use of an adapted constructive controversy approach, there is a greater opportunity to enhance the quality of a cooperative approach to patients’ care planning. Training in team conflict resolution is needed as a key ingredient to ensure all team members can enhance the effectiveness and quality of interprofessional client-centered collaborative practice. This benefits not only the health providers in the team, but also their clients/patients who are recipients of their shared teamwork.

Interprofessional education opportunities for health care educators in the practice setting may be helpful in preparing educators to meet the needs of frontline staff, yet the extant state of literature on this topic has not been recently synthesized. In this integrative review, we aimed to explore what is known about interprofessional education opportunities offered to health care educators who are responsible for educating other health care professionals in practice settings and assess how these education opportunities were described and evaluated in the literature. Methods: We conducted an integrative literature review following the methodology put forth by Toronto and Remington. Results: Of the 3690 publications identified, 30 met our inclusion criteria. Overall, the publications lacked rigorous methodology. Education interventions varied in content, duration, and teaching strategies. Key findings were identified: (1) educator satisfaction and content relevance, (2) impact on knowledge, skills, and confidence, (3) impact on teaching practice, (4) impact on clinical practice, (5) impact on interprofessional competencies and attitudes, (6) challenges to implementing interprofessional education opportunities, and (7) facilitators to implementing interprofessional education opportunities. Discussion: Although interprofessional education opportunities for health care educators in the practice setting may be beneficial to educators and the frontline staff they serve, more rigorous research is needed to understand how these opportunities can influence teaching and clinical practice.

Despite existing literature on the impact of context on practice, the nature and influence of contextual characteristics, and how context is defined and measured, remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to map the breadth and depth of the literature on how context is defined and measured and the contextual characteristics that may influence professional competencies. Methods: A scoping review using Arksey and O’Malley’s framework. We searched MEDLINE (Ovid) and CINAHL (EBSCO). Our inclusion criteria were studies that reported on context or relationships between contextual characteristics and professional competencies or that measured context. We extracted data on context definitions, context measures and their psychometric properties, and contextual characteristics influencing professional competencies. We performed numerical and qualitative analyses. Results: After duplicate removal, 9106 citations were screened and 283 were retained. We compiled a list of 67 context definitions and 112 available measures, with or without psychometric properties. We identified 60 contextual factors and organized them into five themes: Leadership and Agency, Values, Policies, Supports, and Demands. Discussion: Context is a complex construct that covers a wide array of dimensions. Measures are available, but none include the five dimensions in one single measure or focus on items targeting the likelihood of context influencing several competencies. Given that the practice context plays a critical role in health care professionals’ competencies, stakeholders from all sectors (education, practice, and policy) should work together to address those contextual characteristics that can adversely influence practice.

Numeracy is fundamental in the role of a health care provider, forming the basis of evidence-based medicine and effective patient-provider communication. Despite a high level of education, many health care providers struggle with numeracy. Numeracy is often integrated into training curricula; however, teaching modality, competencies covered, learner satisfaction, and effectiveness of these educational interventions varies.Method:A scoping review was conducted to explore and summarize what is known about numeracy skills education programs for health care providers. A comprehensive literature search was conducted from January 2010 to April 2021 in 10 databases. Controlled vocabulary terms and text words were used. The search was restricted to human studies, adults, and the English language. Articles were included if they were related to numeracy education for health care providers or trainees and provided details regarding methods, evaluation, and results.Results:The literature search retrieved 31,611 results and 71 met the inclusion criteria. Most interventions were conducted in a university setting, and targeted nursing students, medical students, resident physicians, and pharmacy students. Common numeracy concepts included statistics/biostatistics, medication calculations, evidence-based medicine, research methodology, and epidemiology. A variety of teaching modalities were used, which most often combined active approaches (eg, workshops, laboratories, small-group exercises, and discussion boards) with passive approaches (eg, traditional lectures and didactic teaching). Measured outcomes included knowledge and skills, self-efficacy, attitudes, and engagement.Discussion:Although efforts have been made to incorporate numeracy into training curricula, greater emphasis should be placed on developing strong numeracy skills in health care providers, particularly given the role numerical information plays in clinical decision making, evidence-based practices, and patient-provider communication. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Of respondents, 53 (65.4%) achieved high knowledge, 34 (42.0%) high beliefs, and 42 (59.1%) high concept exposure question scores, but only 6 (7.4%) through a formal route. Although 78 (96.8%) respondents indicated that survey concepts are relevant, only 18 (22.2%) reported fully incorporating them in their work, and 48 (59.2%) identified the need for additional coaching. Respondents reporting full incorporation were significantly more likely to attain high concept exposure scores (17 respondents, 94.4%, versus 25 respondents, 39.7%, P <.001). Quantitative and qualitative analysis highlighted limited respondent awareness of trauma prevalence among health care workers, lack of familiarity with interventions, and time and resource challenges addressing childhood adversity.Discussion:Although survey respondents had some familiarity with study concepts and perceived their relevance, most are not fully applying them. Results suggest that exposure to study concepts is associated with full incorporation. Therefore, intentional faculty development is essential to prepare faculty to include this science in practice. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Realist evaluation enables the generation, refinement, and testing theories of change by unpacking what works for whom under what circumstances and why. This study used realist methods to explore relationships between outcomes, mechanisms (resources and reasoning), and context factors of a national multisource feedback (MSF) program.Methods:Linked data for 50 physicians were examined to determine relationships between action plan completion status (outcomes), MSF ratings, MSF comments and prescribing data (resource mechanisms), a report summarizing the conversation between a facilitator and physician (reasoning mechanism), and practice risk factors (context). Working backward from outcomes enabled exploration of similarities and differences in mechanisms and context.Results:The derived model showed that the completion status of plans was influenced by interaction of resource and reasoning mechanisms with context mediating the relationships. Two patterns were emerged. Physicians who implemented all their plans within six months received feedback with consistent messaging, reviewed data ahead of facilitation, coconstructed plan(s) with the facilitator, and had fewer risks to competence (dyscompetence). Physicians who were unable to implement any plans had data with fewer repeated messages and did not incorporate these into plans, had difficult plans, or needed to involve others and were physician-led, and were at higher risk for dyscompetence.Discussion:Evaluation of quality improvement initiatives should examine program outcomes taking into consideration the interplay of resources, reasoning, and risk factors for dyscompetence. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Although these FD approaches are well received by faculty, they remain underused and/or underreported, with limited opportunities to receive feedback in workplace contexts. The goal of our study was to map the depth and breadth of education literature on the use of observation of teaching as a tool of professional development in medical education. Methods: Following the methodology by Arksey and O’Malley, we conducted a scoping review and searched four databases for articles published in English (final searches in April 2022). Results: Of 2080 articles identified, 45 met the inclusion criteria. All observation activities were associated with one of the following FD approaches: peer observation of teaching (23 articles, 51%), peer coaching (12, 27%), peer review (9, 20%), and the critical friends approach (1, 2%). Thirty-three articles (73%) concerned formative versions of the observation model that took place in clinical settings (21, 47%), and they tended to be a voluntary (27, 60%), one-off (18, 40%), in-person intervention (29, 65%), characterized by limited institutional support (13, 29%). Both barriers and challenges of teaching observation were identified. Discussion: This review identified several challenges and shortcomings associated with teaching observation, such as inadequate methodological quality of research articles, inconsistent terminology, and limited understanding of the factors that promote long-term sustainability within FD programs. Practical strategies to consider when designing an FD program that incorporates teaching observation are outlined. © 2024 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210211854"

This trend forces non-genetics physicians (NGPs) to facilitate patient consent for genetic testing. However, research on NGPs' knowledge of consent elements (CK) required for ES has not been explored.Methods:Columbia University NGPs were invited to take a survey (premodule survey [PrS]) assessing CK for ES. Educational modules on ES were then created and sent to NGP participants. A postmodule survey (PoS) was sent to NGPs a month later to assess the change in CK scores. Alpha was set at ≤0.05.Results:Nineteen participants completed the PrS and PoS. Overall PrS CK scores were low (mean = 8, SD 1.6). There was no difference in PrS CK scores between attendings and residents/fellows (P =.2), and PrS CK scores did not correlate with time since medical school graduation (P =.9). PoS CK scores were higher than PrS CK scores (P =.03). Most NGPs (74%) were satisfied with the module.Conclusions:Our findings suggest a need for continuing education of both new and experienced NGPs on best practices for consenting for ES. An online module with information tailored to different specialties could be an effective format for delivering this education.

Given the drastic changes in the learning environment, this study explored “technagogy” or teaching with technology in CPD in the health professions. Methods: A mixed-methods study was used to ascertain the determinants and merits of CPD success from the participants’ perspectives (n = 237). The quantitative data underwent structural equation modeling using partial least squares. We also thematically analyzed the qualitative responses and synthesized concurrent findings. Results: The structural model accounted for a 64% variance in the CPD success. Its significant direct predictors (P < .05) were instructional, curriculum, and nurturant effects. From the participants’ experiences, we generated four themes as the merits of CPD: learning, teaching, knowledge, and technology scholarships. Finally, we constructed a synthesized model, the CPD Determinants and Intrinsic Assets in Learning, which can offer modest guidance in navigating CPD with technagogy. Discussion: The study findings emphasize the convergence and divergence points as considerations in teaching and learning with technology. It also offers valuable insights into relevant implications of technagogy in CPD, including its theory, practice, policy, and research.

Developmental psychologists Bob Kegan and Lisa Lahey have attributed such knowledge-implementation gaps to an “Immunity to Change” rooted in tacit “Big Assumptions.” These Big Assumptions produce fears or worries, reveal competing commitments, and result in actions or inactions that hinder intended change. We sought to understand the barriers to change in online and blended CPD, to support CPD leaders in pursuing their goals for optimal use of technology in CPD. This inquiry arose from the 13th National Continuing Professional Development Accreditation Conference of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and the College of Family Physicians of Canada, a virtual conference held in October 2022. After introducing the Immunity to Change framework and best practices in online and blended learning, we invited audience members to list Big Assumptions in CPD through chat and polling software. These responses were analyzed and grouped into five interrelated Big Assumptions that suggest a number of key barriers to optimal implementation of online CPD. We present data that counter each Big Assumption along with practical approaches to facilitate desired change for CPD.

Academic health care leaders are seeking effective modalities to overcome obstacles, modernize, and become more efficient. Three of the commonly used approaches for improvement are strategic planning, strategic thinking, and continuous process improvement (CPI), and these concepts have been used in a variety of forms throughout industry, higher education, and health care. However, their definitions are often not well understood, and their processes are misconstrued in practice. With the increased expectation of health care institutions with undergraduate, graduate, and continuing education to consider strategic processes in organizational improvement, it is important for leadership to understand the differences in these three approaches. In this article, we explain the concepts of strategic planning, strategic thinking, and CPI through an overview of their history, definitions, and the benefits and pitfalls as observed by researchers.

The Framework provides conceptual tools to analyze interconnections between workplaces, the organization of work tasks, and learning. Through these interconnections, the Framework introduces the concepts of “expansive learning environments” and “restrictive learning environments.” This paper provides an overview of the WALF before discussing possible implications for continuing professional development educators and researchers. Ultimately, this Foundations paper invites readers to engage with the rich scholarship on workplace learning informed by sociocultural concepts of learning and complemented by research on work and workplaces. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Given the impact of faculty role models and mentors to student and trainee learning, mapping the landscape of PIF among faculty takes on increased importance. We conducted a scoping review of PIF through the lens of situated learning theory. Our scoping review question was: How is situated learning theory used to understand the process of PIF among graduate medical educators?Methods:The scoping review methodology described by Levac et al. served as the architecture for this review. Medline, Embase, PubMed, ERIC, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Web of Science Core Collection were searched (from inception) using a combination of terms that describe PIF among graduate medical educators.Results:Of the 1434 unique abstracts screened, 129 articles underwent full-text review, with 14 meeting criteria for inclusion and full coding. Significant results organized into three main themes: importance of using common definitions; evolution of theory over time with untapped explanatory power; identity as a dynamic construct.Discussion:The current body of knowledge leaves many gaps. These include lack of common definitions, need to apply ongoing theoretical insights to research, and exploration of professional identity as an evolving construct. As we come to understand PIF among medical faculty more fully, twin benefits accrue: (1) Community of practices can be designed deliberately to encourage full participation of all graduate medical education faculty who desire it, and (2) Faculty can more effectively lead trainees in negotiating the ongoing process of PIF across the landscape of professional identities. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Mentorship could be a means through which QI is fostered, developed, and incorporated into continuing professional development (CPD) programs. The current study examined (1) models of implementation for mentorship within the Department of Psychiatry of a large Canadian academic center; (2) mentorship as a potential vehicle for alignment of QI practices and CPD; and (3) needs for the implementation of QI and CPD mentorship programs.Methods:Qualitative interviews were conducted with 14 individuals associated with the university's Department of Psychiatry. The data were analyzed through thematic analyses with two independent coders using COREQ guidelines.Results:Our results identified uncertainty among the participants regarding the conceptualization of QI and CPD, illustrating difficulties in determining whether mentorship could be used to align these practices. Three major themes were identified in our analyses: sharing of QI work through communities of practices; the need for organizational support; and relational experiences of QI mentoring.Discussion:A greater understanding of QI is necessary before psychiatry departments can implement mentorship to enhance QI practices. However, models of mentorship and needs for mentorship have been made clear and include a good mentorship fit, organizational support, and opportunities for both formal and informal mentorship. Changing organizational culture and providing appropriate training is necessary for enhancing QI. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

We present the application of the ECHO model to longitudinal training and consultation for community behavioral health providers learning to deliver cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis, an evidence-based psychotherapy for individuals with psychotic disorders that has poorly penetrated the US mental health system.Methods:We analyzed within-group change over practitioners' 6-month ECHO participation cycle using the Expanded Outcomes Framework. We evaluated outcomes associated with participation, satisfaction, knowledge acquisition, performance, patient symptom severity, and functional impairment.Results:In the first 3 years, the cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis ECHO Clinics supported 150 providers from 12 community agencies. Forty percent did not complete the 6-month ECHO calendar, most commonly due to separation from their agency. Participants reported high degrees of satisfaction. Declarative and procedural knowledge increased over the 6-month period. Of the 24 providers who received a fidelity review, 87.5% met or exceeded the competency benchmark within the 6-month period. Clinical outcomes reflected reductions in hallucinations, negative symptoms, depression, mania, and functional impairment, but no reductions were detected in delusions, disorganized speech, or abnormal psychomotor behavior.Discussion:ECHO Clinics offer a mode of providing continuous access to expert instruction, peer-to-peer consultation, and case-based learning that other workforce training models lack. Our evaluation suggests that the ECHO model supports continuous professional development for practitioners, most of whom had indicated inadequate preparation for their role.

The cost-effectiveness of continuing professional development for health care providers has not been historically well characterized despite substantial investment. This literature review identified publications considering the costs and cost-effectiveness of accredited continuing medical education activities. Methods: Searches were conducted for English language records in PubMed and the gray literature using a 10-year lookback period from March 10, 2023. Search terms included concepts related to continuing medical education, cost, effect, and utilization. One reviewer conducted title/abstract screening, full-text review, and data extraction, with direction and adjudication of search and screening concepts provided by the lead advisor. Publications were categorized as related to costs of an educational intervention (Concept 1) and/or the impact of education on health care costs (Concept 2). Results were summarized using descriptive statistics. Results: A total of 668 database records were screened, 125 (19%) underwent full-text review, and 25 of 125 (20%) were accepted; 7 of 351 (2%) gray literature sources were accepted for a total of 32 included records. The most common reason for rejection was not being an accredited activity. Of the 32 records, 27 (84%) were related to Concept 1 only, 3 (9%) to Concept 2 only, and 2 (6%) to both Concepts 1 and 2. Approximately half (n = 19, 59%) mentioned costs without supporting data. Discussion: These findings show that considerations of cost and cost-effectiveness are rare in the accredited continuing medical education literature, which may limit how the value of continuing medical education is characterized.

Although all competencies are deemed essential, scholarly practice requires that professionals critically assess their practices, integrate evidence-based literature, and enhance the care they deliver to patients. Though scholarly practice is also associated with professional empowerment, role satisfaction, and improved patient care, it is rarely measured. The purpose of this study was to develop, pilot, and generate preliminary validity evidence of a tool designed to measure scholarly practice among RTs. Methods: We used DeVellis’ nine-step scale development process and exploratory factor analysis to develop the tool. The results of a scoping review and qualitative study were used to generate an item pool and pilot test it with 81 RTs across Canada. The refined tool was tested on a larger sample (n = 832) and analyzed using exploratory factor analysis. Results: Using principal axis factoring with Promax rotation, we retained 18 items across 4 factors, explaining 56.7% of the variance in the data (31.7%, 10.2%, 8.6%, 6.2%): (Factor 1) professional development and credibility, (Factor 2) elements supporting scholarly practice, (Factor 3) the perceived impact of scholarly activities on practice, and (Factor 4) scholarly practitioner identity and ability. Internal consistency of the final 18-item scale was suitable overall (Cronbach alpha = 0.879) and for each factor (F1 = 0.888; F2 = 0.774; F3 = 0.842; F4 = 0.746). Discussion: Our results provide preliminary evidence for a scholarly practice tool that can encourage self-reflection and/or foster peer-based reflection. Using the tool with other health care professionals and conducting confirmatory factor analysis could generate additional validity evidence.

We lack evidence, however, on how physicians' confidence in their knowledge relates to performance on assessments, and whether this varies based on the stakes of the assessment.Methods:Our retrospective repeated-measures design compared differences in patterns of physician answer accuracy and answer confidence among physicians participating in both a high-stakes and a low-stakes longitudinal assessment of the American Board of Family Medicine.Results:After 1 and 2 years, participants were more often correct but less confident in their accuracy on a higher-stakes longitudinal knowledge assessment compared with a lower-stakes assessment. There were no differences in question difficulty between the two platforms. Variation existed between platforms in time spent answering questions, use of resources to answer questions, and perceived question relevance to practice.Discussion:This novel study of physician certification suggests that the accuracy of physician performance increases with higher stakes, even as self-reported confidence in their knowledge declines. It suggests that physicians may be more engaged in higher-stakes compared with lower-stakes assessments. With medical knowledge growing exponentially, these analyses provide an example of the complementary roles of higher- and lower-stakes knowledge assessment in supporting physician learning during continuing specialty board certification. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This study examined the national landscape and local faculty perceptions of their own institution’s FDT requirement. An electronic survey was disseminated to Faculty Affairs Offices in US medical schools to assess FDT requirements. A second survey was distributed to faculty within one medical school to gauge faculty perceptions related to existing FDT requirements. Responses were received from approximately 33% of US medical schools and 36% of local faculty. Few responding medical schools had formal FDT requirements. There was a wide range variation of hours and activities necessary to satisfy existing requirements and consequences for noncompliance. For respondents from schools that did not have a requirement, many saw value in considering a future requirement. Many local faculty agreed that the FDT requirement improved their teaching skills. When asked to share other thoughts about the FDT requirement, several qualitative themes emerged. This study helps establish a national benchmark for the status of FDT requirements in medical education and revealed information on how to optimize and/or improve such requirements. The authors offer five recommendations for schools to consider regarding FDT. © 2024 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210367036"

Continuing professional development programs (CPD) can offer a potential solution to further mental health training; however, engaging primary care organizations (PCOs) can be challenging. The use of “big data” to identify factors influencing engagement in CPD programs has not been well studied. Therefore, the aim of this project was to use administrative health data from Ontario, Canada to identify characteristics of PCOs associated with early engagement in a virtual CPD program, Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) Ontario Mental Health (ECHO ONMH). Methods: Ontario health administrative data for fiscal year 2014 was used to compare the characteristics of ECHO ONMH-adopting PCOs, and their patients, to nonadopter organizations (N = 280 vs. N = 273 physicians). Results: ECHO-adopting PCOs did not differ with respect to physician age or years of practice, although PCOs with more female physicians were somewhat more likely to participate. ECHO ONMH adoption was more likely in regions with lower psychiatrist supply, among PCOs using partial salary payment models, and those with a greater interprofessional complement. Patients of ECHO-adopters did not differ on the basis of gender or health care utilization (physical or mental health); however, ECHO-adopting PCOs tended to have patients with less psychiatric comorbidity. Discussion: Models such as Project ECHO, which deliver CPD to primary care, are advanced to address lack of access to specialist health care. These findings support the use of administrative health data to assess the implementation, spread, and impact of CPD. © 2024 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199415748"

It has been linked to diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Little is known about the perceptions and practices of primary care physicians (PCPs) regarding MetS. The only studies examining this research topic were conducted outside the United States. The aim of this study was to evaluate the MetS knowledge, proficiency, training, and practices of American PCPs, for the purpose of informing future physician education initiatives directed at MetS. Methods: This was a descriptive correlational design using a Likert-scale questionnaire. The survey was distributed to more than 4000 PCPs. The first 100 completed surveys were evaluated using descriptive statistical analyses. Results: Cumulative survey results revealed that most PCPs perceived themselves as knowledgeable on MetS, but only a minority demonstrated an understanding of leading-edge MetS protocols. Ninety-seven percent agreed that MetS is a condition of concern, but only 22% reported possessing sufficient time and resources to fully address MetS. Only half indicated that they had received training in MetS. Discussion: Overall results suggested that a lack of time, training, and resources may pose the greatest obstacles to optimal MetS care. Future studies should aim to identify the specific reasons why these barriers exist.

Existing research describes coach professional development, competencies, and program perceptions. However, limited research exists on how programs address coach professional development needs. Our sequential objectives were to (1) explore faculty coach professional development experiences within medical student coaching programs and (2) develop a preliminary framework for medical faculty coach professional development.Methods:Faculty portfolio coaches who completed 4 years of a longitudinal coaching program were recruited to complete a semi-structured exit interview. Interviews were transcribed using detailed transcription. Two analysts inductively generated a codebook of parent and child codes to identify themes. They compared themes to the professional development model proposed by O'Sullivan and Irby.Results:Of the 25 eligible coaches, 15 completed the interview. Our team organized themes into two broad domains paralleling the established model: program-specific professional development and career-relevant professional development. Four program-specific professional development themes emerged: doing; modeling; relating; and hosting. Three career-relevant professional development themes emerged: advancement; meaning; and understanding. We then applied themes within each domain to propose strategies to optimize coach professional development and develop a framework modeled after O'Sullivan and Irby.Discussion:To our knowledge, we propose the first portfolio coach-informed framework for professional development. Our work builds on established standards, expert opinion, and research responsible for portfolio coach professional development and competencies. Allied health institutions with portfolio coaching programs can apply the framework for professional development innovation. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Studies including measurable outcomes were analyzed using an inductive analytic approach. The review adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for scoping reviews. Data were synthesized using Moore seven levels of outcomes for continuing professional development education. Findings were grouped by curriculum content and described according to levels of outcome.Results:Of 1492 articles, 11 were included in the analysis. Six described mental health programs, two described skill-specific programs, and three described suicide prevention programs. Programs reviewed content about mental illness, practical skills, included didactic and experiential teaching. The programs achieved level 5 on Moore taxonomy. Programs led to improvements in knowledge, skills, and attitudes among officers; however, improvements declined post-training. Officers were receptive to facilitators with correctional or lived mental health experience. Experiential teaching was preferred. Common themes related to programs' effectiveness included applicability to COs, information retention, program facilitators, and teaching methods.Discussion:There is limited, but positive literature suggesting that education programs are beneficial. The decline in improvements suggests need to ensure sustainability of improvements. This review can guide the planning of future education programs for COs based on continuing professional development best practices. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Methods: A retrospective, within-subjects analysis of the change in perceived confidence, skill, and knowledge in procedure performance after the simulation-based primary care procedural skills training program measured by pretraining and post-training Likert scale surveys and change in clinical procedure performance frequency for abscess incision and drainage and laceration repair up to 6 months before and 6 months after the training in the outpatient setting was performed. Results: Participants self-reported higher median confidence, perceived skill, and perceived knowledge of all procedures included in the training course, with statistically significant increases for all procedures. A mean increase in laceration repairs in the clinical setting of 10% after training was found. Higher median performance of abscess incision and drainage after training (median = 20.00%, n = 25) compared with before training (median = 0.00%, n = 25) and a mean increase in performance of abscess incision and drainage in the clinical setting of 6% after training was found, but increases were not statistically significant. Discussion: Participation in a 2-day simulation-based primary care procedural skills training program was an effective method to increase confidence, perceived skill, and knowledge of outpatient procedures among practicing providers. Further evaluation to establish return on investment is needed, because statistically significant increases in clinical procedure performance were unable to be demonstrated.

However, there is limited knowledge on the role of eHealth data analysis to inform continuing professional development (CPD). The aim of this study was to collate available research evidence on the use of eHealth data for the development of CPD programs and plans for medical practitioners. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the six-stage Arksey and O’Malley Framework. A consultation exercise (stage 6) was performed with 15 international experts in the fields of learning and practice analytics to deepen the insights. Results: Scoping review. The literature searches identified 9876 articles published from January 2010 to May 2022. After screening and full-text review, a total of nine articles were deemed relevant for inclusion. The results provide varied—and at times partial or diverging—answers to the scoping review research questions. Consultation exercise. Research rigor, field of investigation, and developing the field were the three themes emerged from analysis. Participants validated the scoping review methodology and confirmed its results. Moreover, they provided a meta-analysis of the literature, a description of the current CPD ecosystem, and clear indications of what is and should be next for the field. Discussion: This study shows that there is no formal or well-established correlation between eHealth data and CPD planning and programming. Overall findings fill a gap in the literature and provide a basis for further investigation. More foundational work, multidisciplinary collaborations, and stakeholders’ engagement are necessary to advance the use of eHealth data analysis for CPD purposes. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Using a community of practice (CoP) framework, a continuing professional development (CPD) program was created for health professionals to enhance knowledge and exchange best practices.Methods:An online learning platform (Moodle), videoconferencing (Zoom), instant messaging systems (Whatsapp), and email listserv facilitated learning and interaction between program participants. Target participants initially included pharmacy staff and expanded to include other health professionals. Learning modules included asynchronous assignments and review of materials, live discussion sessions, and module pretests and posttests. Evaluation included participants' activities, changes in knowledge, and assignment completion. Participants provided feedback on program quality via surveys and interviews.Results:Five of 11 participants in Year 1 earned a certificate of completion, and 17 of 45 participants earned a certificate in Year 2. Most modules showed an increase in module pretest and posttest scores. Ninety-seven percent of participants indicated that the relevance and usefulness of modules were good or outstanding. Ongoing evaluation indicated changes in Year 2 for program improvement, and notable outcomes indicated how CoP added value in developing a true community.Discussion:Using a CoP framework allowed participants to improve their personal knowledge and become part of a learning community and network of interdisciplinary health care professionals. Lessons learned included expanding program evaluation to capture potential value creation of the community of practice in addition to individual-level development; providing briefer, more focused programs to better serve busy working professionals; and optimizing use of technological platforms to improve participant engagement. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The authors explored the adaptations and innovations in CPD that were strengthened or newly created during the first 16 months of the pandemic. Methods: The objectives of the narrative review were to answer the following questions: (1) what types of adaptations to CPD innovations are described? and (2) what may shape future innovations in CPD? The following databases were searched: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and ERIC to identify the literature published between March 2020 to July 2021. The authors conducted a comprehensive search by including all study types that described adaptations and/or innovations in CPD during the stated pandemic period. Results: Of the 8295 citations retrieved from databases, 191 satisfied the inclusion criteria. The authors found three categories to describe adaptations to CPD innovations: (1) creation of new online resources, (2) increased use of the existing online platforms/software to deliver CPD, and (3) use of simulation for teaching and learning. Reported advantages and disadvantages associated with these adaptations included logistical, interactional, and capacity building elements. The review identified five potential future CPD innovations: (1) empirical research on the effectiveness of virtual learning; (2) novel roles and ways of thinking; (3) learning from other disciplines beyond medicine; (4) formation of a global perspective; and (5) emerging wellness initiatives. Discussion: This review provided an overview of the adaptations and innovations that may shape the future of CPD beyond the pandemic. © 2024 The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210211157"

This review aimed to determine whether AHP education programs improve the knowledge of AHPs, change their clinical practice behavior, and/or improve patient-related clinical outcome and to identify important components of these programs.Methods:Four electronic databases were searched. Controlled clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of clinical education programs were included. Education programs were diverse, varying in design, delivery mode, and intensity. Only therapy-specific AHPs were included. Effectiveness was determined by differences in group outcomes in the domains of AHP knowledge, AHP clinical practice behavior, and patient-related clinical outcomes.Results:Forty-four studies were identified, of which 26 included physiotherapists only. Most control groups were waitlist, passive dissemination of information, or usual care, limiting comparisons between programs. Changes in AHP knowledge was investigated in 20 trials, with 13 showing an improvement. Thirty studies investigated changes in AHP clinical practice behavior, with half demonstrating a difference between groups. Seventeen studies investigated a patient-related clinical outcome, with five finding a difference between groups. Where improvements in outcomes were demonstrated, programs tended to incorporate self-selection and cater to the learner's contextual needs.Discussion:AHP knowledge is effectively improved through targeted education programs. To change AHP behavior and patient outcomes, it seems important to incorporate self-selection for the program and consider the learner's individual needs and contexts through mentoring, outreach visits, reflection, and incorporating patient participation in the learning. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

In contrast to most of the studies which focused on the needs of faculty members, we focus on the needs of those who fulfill the needs of others. We highlight the knowledge gap and lack of adaptation of the field to consider the issue of professional development of faculty developers more broadly by studying how they identify their knowledge gaps and what approaches they use to address those gaps. The discussion of this problem sheds light on the professional development of faculty developers and offers several implications for practice and research. Our own piece of the solution indicates that faculty developers follow a multimodal approach to the development of their knowledge, including formal and informal approaches to addressing perceived gaps. Within this multimodal approach, our results suggest that the professional growth and learning of faculty developers is best characterized as a social practice. Based on our research, it would seem worthwhile for those in the field to become more intentional about the professional development of faculty developers and harness aspects of social learning in that process to better reflect faculty developers' learning habits. We also recommend applying these aspects more broadly to, in turn, enhance the development of educational knowledge and educational practices for the faculty members these educators support. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This study aims to improve our understanding of CPD providers' comfort level, supports, perceived advantages/disadvantages, and issues in technology-enhanced CPD delivery during COVID-19. A survey was distributed to CPD providers at the University of Toronto and members of the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Of the 111 respondents, 81% felt very to somewhat confident to provide online CPD, but less than half reported IT, financial, or faculty development supports. The top reported advantage to online CPD delivery was reaching a new demographic; top disadvantages included videoconferencing fatigue, social isolation, and competing priorities. There was interest in using less frequently used educational technology such as online collaboration tools, virtual patients, and augmented/virtual reality. COVID-19 precipitated an increased comfort level in using synchronous technologies to provide CPD, giving the CPD community an increased cultural acceptance and skill level to build on. As we move beyond the pandemic, it will be important to consider ongoing faculty development, particularly toward asynchronous and HyFlex delivery methods to continue expand CPD reach and negate negative online experiences such as videoconferencing fatigue, social isolation, and online distractions. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Using Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review framework and the PRISMA-ScR checklist, we reviewed study designs, temporality, analysis methods, data sources, and levels and types of data in 121 articles evaluating Project ECHO interventions.Results:Most interventions addressed substance use disorders (24.8%, n = 30), infectious diseases (24%, n = 29), psychiatric and behavioral health conditions (21.5%, n = 26), and chronic diseases (19%, n = 23). The most frequently reported evaluation methods included cohort studies (86.8%, n = 105), longitudinal designs (74.4%, n = 90), mixed methods analysis (52.1%, n = 63), surveys (61.2%, n = 74), process evaluation measures (98.3%, n = 119), and provider-level outcome measures (84.3%, n = 102). Few evaluations used experimental designs (1.7%, n = 2), randomization (5.8%, n = 7), or comparison groups (14%, n = 17), indicating limited rigor.Discussion:This scoping review demonstrates the need for more rigorous evaluation methods to test the effectiveness of the Project ECHO model at improving outcomes and standardized reporting guidelines to enhance the dissemination of evaluation data from future Project ECHO interventions.

Barriers to participation can be addressed through medical education for medical practitioners.Introduction:The primary objective was to examine the extent to which digital educational interventions are used to foster advanced care planning skills. Secondary objectives include understanding the acceptability of these interventions and whether electronic health records can be used to personalize learning.Methods:Online databases were used to identify relevant articles published from 2008 to 2021. Nine articles which evaluated the impact of digital learning for medical practitioners were selected. Studies eligible for inclusion in the review assessed changes in knowledge, attitudes, and practice regarding skills used in advanced care planning.Results:All publications used a pre-post study design with education delivered solely online. Only three studies focused on completing advance care plans or directives (33%). All but two studies recorded improvements in knowledge and/or attitudes toward planning (78%) while three studies recorded improvements in clinical practice (33%). The review suggests prior clinical or personal experiences could be used to personalize education.Discussion:The literature revealed that using digital education to develop advanced care planning skills is relatively unexplored despite the ability of this type of learning to improve professional knowledge and confidence. Digital devices can also improve access to relevant information at the point-of-care. Personalized interventions that incorporate prior clinical experiences, potentially extracted from health records, could be used to optimize outcomes. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the effect of physicians' values on their CPD motivation. Methods: Practicing physicians in a single Canadian providence were administered an online survey that assessed their motivation for engaging in CPD, the importance they ascribe to three intrinsic and three extrinsic values, and the extent to which engaging in CPD activities is aligned with intrinsic and extrinsic values. Results: A total of 122 physicians completed the survey. Seeing CPD activities as contributing to helping others was positively associated with intrinsic regulation, identified regulation, and introjected regulation. Seeing CPD activities as contributing to personal growth was positively associated with identified regulation. Discussion: As predicted by the Self-Determination Theory, physicians who perceived CPD as aligned with intrinsic values tended to report a more desirable motivational orientation toward CPD. CPD providers can support health professionals' motivation by highlighting connections between CPD activities and intrinsic values in promotional materials. © 2024 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213883592"

Existing literature on retention strategies, contributing factors to the attrition of rehabilitation professionals and how different environments influence professionals’ decision-making to stay in/leave their profession, is limited in scope and specificity. The objective of our review was to map the depth and breadth of the literature on attrition and retention of rehabilitation professionals. Methods: We used Arksey and O’Malley’s methodological framework. A search was conducted on MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), AMED, CINAHL, Scopus, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses from 2010 to April 2021 for concepts of attrition and retention in occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech-language pathology. Results: Of the 6031 retrieved records, 59 papers were selected for data extraction. Data were organized into three themes: (1) descriptions of attrition and retention, (2) experiences of being a professional, and (3) experiences in institutions where rehabilitation professionals work. Seven factors across three levels (individual, work, and environment) were found to influence attrition. Discussion: Our review showcases a vast, yet superficial array of literature on attrition and retention of rehabilitation professionals. Differences exist between occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech-language pathology with respect to the focus of the literature. Push, pull, and stay factors would benefit from further empirical investigation to develop targeted retention strategies. These findings may help to inform health care institutions, professional regulatory bodies, and associations, as well as professional education programs, to develop resources to support retention of rehabilitation professionals. © 2023 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171187031"

This scoping review was conducted to synthesize evidence on health professions education (HPE) strategies applied to enhance capacities for TSTS implementation in Africa. Methods: This scoping review was conducted using the enhanced Arksey and O’Malley’s framework for scoping reviews. The sources of evidence included CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus. Results: Thirty-eight studies conducted in 23 countries provided insights on the strategies implemented in various health services contexts including general health, cancer screenings, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health, HIV/AIDS, emergency care, hypertension, tuberculosis, eye care, diabetes, mental health, and medicines. The HPE strategies applied were in-service training, onsite clinical supervision and mentoring, periodic supportive supervision, provision of job aides, and preservice education. Discussion: Scaling up HPE based on the evidence from this study will contribute immensely to enhancing the capacity of health workers in contexts where TSTS are being implemented or planned to provide quality health services based on the population’s health needs.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a comprehensive tool for HCPs to document the contextual factors likely to influence the maintenance, development, and deployment of professional competencies.Methods:We used DeVellis' 8-step process for scale development and Messick's unified theory of validity to inform the development and validation of the context tool. Building on results from a scoping review, we generated an item pool of contextual factors articulated around five themes: Leadership and Agency, Values, Policies, Supports, and Demands. A first version of the tool was pilot tested with 127 HCPs and analyzed using the classical test theory. A second version was tested on a larger sample (n = 581) and analyzed using the Rasch rating scale model.Results:First version of the tool: we piloted 117 items that were grouped as per the themes related to contextual factors and rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Cronbach alpha for the set of 12 retained items per scale ranged from 0.75 to 0.94. Second version of the tool included 60 items: Rasch analysis showed that four of the five scales (ie, Leadership and Agency, Values, Policies, Supports) can be used as unidimensional scales, whereas the fifth scale (Demands) had to be split into two unidimensional scales (Demands and Overdemands).Discussion:Validity evidence documented for content and internal structure is encouraging and supports the use of the McGill context tool.

This research study examines, for the first time, the effects of the Transcendental Meditation (TM) technique on academic physician burnout and depression.Methods:A mixed methods randomized controlled trial was conducted with 40 academic physicians representing 15 specialties at a medical school and affiliated VA hospital using the TM technique as the active intervention. Physicians were measured at baseline, 1 month, and 4 months using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Insomnia Severity Index, Perceived Stress Scale, and Brief Resilience Scale. Repeated measures analysis of covariance was used to assess adjusted mean change scores for the 1- and 4-months posttests. Qualitative interviews were conducted at baseline and 4 months and compared with the quantitative measurements.Results:Significant improvements were found for the TM group compared with controls at 4 months in total burnout (p =.020) including the Maslach Burnout Inventory dimensions of emotional exhaustion (p =.042) and personal accomplishment (p =.018) and depression (p =.016). Qualitative interviews supported quantitative outcomes. Physicians reported classic burnout and depression symptoms in baseline interviews. Those regularly practicing the TM technique reported relief from those symptoms. The control group did not state similar changes.Discussion:Mixed methods findings suggest the TM technique is a viable and effective intervention to decrease burnout and depression for academic physicians.

Organizational initiatives are frequently monitored and evaluated using questionnaire data, and to produce high-quality data, reliable instruments are paramount. We aimed to investigate the content validity and reliability of the Danish Onboarding Questionnaire, including cognitive interviewing and test-retest analyses.Method:We investigated content validity, including face validity and the content validity index, and reliability for the percentage of agreement. To analyze the cognitive interview data, thematic analysis was applied, followed by the question-and-answer model to categorize the problems revealed. To test reliability, the percentage of agreement was calculated with an accepted deviation of 1 on test-retest data.Results:Regarding the mental processes, multiple items were identified to be challenged regarding comprehension (clarification of concepts and understanding), judgment (ambiguity and relevance), and response (anonymity and personal information). The mental process retrieval was not represented. The subscale content validity index/Ave was found to be 0.935, representing a ""good"" level of content validity. With an accepted deviation of 1, the mean agreement was 97.7%.Discussion:Questionnaire items causing uncertainties or challenges are potential sources of deteriorated content validity and should be revised. We suggest that the Danish Onboarding Questionnaire-34 undergo an item reduction, which might increase its validity and reliability. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This means missed opportunities to contribute to the evidence-base for better clinical practice and outcomes for people living with disabling, chronic complex conditions. This research aimed to understand rehabilitation doctors' research needs, experience, and aspirations to enable future training initiatives that are tailored to their practice context.Methods:This exploratory sequential mixed-method study comprised a survey followed by focus groups. Rehabilitation doctors from three health services in south-east Queensland, Australia completed an online survey incorporating the Research Spider to explore their research experience, confidence, interest, opportunity, and intent. Focus groups explored the survey results and participants' views regarding strategies to build research capacity.Results:The major findings were the gap between high research interest and low experience, confidence and opportunity; and fundamental research skills were identified as priority training topics. These findings support previous research. However, rehabilitation doctors may also have a self-expectation that, as competent clinicians, they should necessarily also be research-competent, and hold misperceptions regarding the shared nature of health services research.Discussion:Protected time and funding may enhance engagement with research to generate specialty-relevant evidence for practice. To this end, a research capacity building initiative in the form of a series of self-directed learning packages has been developed and implemented. A tailored workshop to strengthen rehabilitation doctors' research skills and engagement has also been developed for implementation. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Instructional methods promoting critical thinking and decision making contribute to effective CPD interventions. The delivery methods influence the uptake of content and the resulting changes in knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behavior. Educational approaches are needed to ensure that CPD meets the changing needs of health care providers. This article examines the development approach and key recommendations embedded in a CE Educator's toolkit created to evolve CPD practice and foster a learning experience that promotes self-awareness, self-reflection, competency, and behavioral change. The Knowledge-to-Action framework was used in designing the toolkit. The toolkit highlighted three intervention formats: facilitation of small group learning, case-based learning, and reflective learning. Strategies and guidelines to promote active learning principles in CPD activities within different modalities and learning contexts were included. The goal of the toolkit is to assist CPD providers to design educational activities that optimally support health care providers' self-reflection and knowledge translation into their clinical environment and contribute to practice improvement, thus achieving the outcomes of the quintuple aim. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

We systematically determined baseline interpretation skill, the number of pCXR cases physicians required complete to achieve a performance benchmark, and which diagnoses posed the greatest diagnostic challenge.Methods:Physicians interpreted 434 pCXR cases via a web-based platform until they achieved a performance benchmark of 85% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Interpretation difficulty scores for each case were derived by applying one-parameter item response theory to participant data. We compared interpretation difficulty scores across diagnostic categories and described the diagnoses of the 30% most difficult-to-interpret cases.Results:240 physicians who practice in one of three geographic areas interpreted cases, yielding 56,833 pCXR case interpretations. The initial diagnostic performance (first 50 cases) of our participants demonstrated an accuracy of 68.9%, sensitivity of 69.4%, and a specificity of 68.4%. The median number of cases completed to achieve the performance benchmark was 102 (interquartile range 69, 176; min, max, 54, 431). Among the 30% most difficult-to-interpret cases, 39.2% were normal pCXR and 32.3% were cases of lobar pneumonia. Cases with a single trauma-related imaging finding, cardiac, hilar, and diaphragmatic pathologies were also among the most challenging.Discussion:At baseline, practicing physicians misdiagnosed about one-third of pCXR and there was up to an eight-fold difference between participants in number of cases completed to achieve the standardized performance benchmark. We also identified the diagnoses with the greatest potential for educational intervention. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Efforts to make continuing medical education (CME) programs mandatory in the South-East Asia Region by linking credits to the renewal of registration have met with mixed success. However, there are no recent reviews on the CME status in regions with a large number of developing countries. This review aims to map the practices and regulation of the CME activities in the South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions.Methods:A scoping review was undertaken using a modified Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. A search was conducted within PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus databases, and national medical and health council websites.Results:Evidence on the provision of CME is available for all but seven of the 33 countries in both regions. Fourteen countries of varying income levels have implemented mandatory CME linked to the renewal of registration. They have statutory bodies governing CME and allocating credits, with most requiring a large number of hourly based activities for the renewal of registration and evidence of a wide range of local providers.Discussion:Financial resources, a thorough organizational structure and standards, and a wide range of local CME providers seem to promote the implementation of mandatory CME in most of these countries. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Learning science has compiled a set of evidence-based strategies, such as distributed practice, retrieval practice, and interleaving, which are quite relevant to continuing professional development (CPD). Spreading out study and practice separated by cognitive breaks (distributed practice), testing oneself to check mastery and memory of previously learned information (retrieval practice), and mixing the learning of distinct but related material (interleaving) represent strategies that are underutilized in CPD. Participants and planners alike can benefit from learning science recommendations to inform their decisions.

To clarify the causal relationships underlying program outcomes and facilitate a necessary shift from outcomes-only–based approaches to outcome-based and theory-based approaches in program development and evaluation, we developed a model of mechanisms mapped to relevant outcomes. Methods: Mechanisms identified in a prior realist synthesis of opioid agonist therapy continuing professional development programs were iteratively tested and refined using purposive and opportunistic sampling and realist approaches against two systematic reviews of programs in analgesic prescribing and palliative care. Further testing involved practical application within programs in sustainable health care and pain management. Results: Ninety reports on 75 programs and practical application to multiple additional programs informed the final model consisting of five distinct mechanisms: motivation transformation, expert influence, confidence development, self-efficacy facilitation, and community of practice expansion. The mechanisms and related analysis emphasize that continuing professional development is heterogeneous, complex, and context dependent. Discussion: Shifting toward outcome-based and theory-based approaches facilitates further conceptual shifts at intraprogram and interprogram and interintervention levels toward more deliberate program development and evaluation, increased program complementarity and subsequent collaboration. It clarifies opportunities for intercalation of continuing professional development with other intervention sciences. The model presents a resource for practitioners, researchers, and policymakers to advance continuing professional development planning, coordination, and evaluation. © 2023 The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210109131"

This report describes a pilot rubric, SMART-EP (emotional intelligence(EI)/professionalism), exploring goal “SMARTness” alongside change (impact) in participants’ perceived precepting capabilities. Methods: HOP-R self-ratings (2018–2020) and HOF/SMART goals (2019–2020) were retrospectively reviewed by two raters. Perceived preceptor capabilities were measured by analyzing the change in self-assessed habit level ratings between the first/ fourth-quarter surveys. SMART goals were categorized by HOF and inclusion of SMART-EP components. Participants were guided in the inclusion of SMART, but not -EP, components. Results: In aggregate, 120 participants completed HOP-R surveys (2018–2020). Within-subject changes across all 11 habits were significant (P < .001). For the SMART-EP rubric analysis (2019–2020), 71 participants had an average “SMARTness” score of 3.92 (of 5) with corresponding interrater reliability of 0.91. Goals included 2.77 (of 4) EI traits and 1.72 (of 3) professionalism components. Discussion: The SMART-EP rubric provided insights into preceptor development opportunities among participants. Beyond SMART components, participants often included elements of EI and professionalism. Ratings confirm and support the consistency of the HOP-R as a tool to assess precepting habits.

Scholars are not well-trained in how to choose among these opportunities, often learning via trial and error. The ability to navigate collaborations is framed by several principles and considerations: (1) locus of control (what control we have over our own behavior) and how it affects academic job satisfaction; (2) the scarcity mindset that may manifest as a result of the fear of missing future opportunities; and (3) power dynamics and inequities (eg, among women and racial/ethnic minority individuals). To provide a more systematic approach to weighing academic opportunities, the authors offer 30 questions across six overlapping domains. The domains include: the big picture (eg, Is the opportunity a building block for your career?), context (eg, How much do you have on your plate?), person (eg, Who is asking?), team (eg, Is the team productive?), role (eg, Will you lead or assist?), and outcomes (eg, Might the opportunity lead to publications and/or grants?). We offer advice for decision-making. For example, when presented with an opportunity involving a significant time commitment, it is useful to allow at least 24 hours before deciding. The authors offer advice and sample language for communicating your decision. Although every situation is different, there are several fundamental issues and questions to consider when one is presented with a new opportunity - these questions are suggested for mentors and mentees. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

However, little is known about the development and validation of these assessment practices. We aimed to document the breadth and depth of what is known about the development and implementation of assessment practices within CPD activities.Methods:We conducted a scoping review using the framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley (2005) and updated in 2020. We examined five databases and identified 1733 abstracts. Two team members screened titles and abstracts for inclusion/exclusion. After data extraction, we conducted a descriptive analysis of quantitative data and a thematic analysis of qualitative data.Results:A total of 130 studies were retained for the full review. Most reported assessments are written assessments (n = 100), such as multiple-choice items (n = 79). In 99 studies, authors developed an assessment for research purpose rather than for the CPD activity itself. The assessment validation process was detailed in 105 articles. In most cases, the authors examined the content with experts (n = 57) or pilot-tested the assessment (n = 50). We identified three themes: 1-satisfaction with assessment choices; 2-difficulties experienced during the administration of the assessment; and 3-complexity of the validation process.Discussion:Building on the adage ""assessment drives learning,"" it is imperative that the CPD practices contribute to the intended learning and limit the unintended negative consequences of assessment. Our results suggest that validation processes must be considered and adapted within CPD contexts. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This article is a reflection on our experience of (1) transitioning from independently operating health professions CE units in medicine, nursing, and pharmacy to becoming a Joint Accreditation provider of interprofessional CE and (2) developing and using a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Toolkit for Accredited Continuing Education. We examined these instances of substantial change to identify what made them achievable and supported our well-being throughout the process. We also considered a social cognitive theory, a schema theory, and a normalization process theory. As a result, we identified five steps of the CE planning and implementation process to be our trusted mental model and the key factor in making the changes doable for our team and supporting our resilience and a sense of well-being. Interviews with three clinician-learners, which were conducted in search of additional insights, reminded us that positive reinforcement occurs when we see the desired result. Thus, measuring the CE change and its impact on learners and their patients is also a tool to sustain emotional comfort during the turbulence of a change cascade, given the measures show progress in a desired direction. We hope this article will stimulate peer discussions, reflections, and sharing of lessons learned from similar journeys. © 2024 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210203878"

An innovative, online, 13-week course using a flipped classroom model was developed for junior faculty anesthesiologists at teaching hospitals in East Africa and piloted in Ethiopia and Tanzania. Methods: Quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed to evaluate potential change in participants’ knowledge, skills, and attitudes as well as the feasibility of e-learning in the region. Results: Analysis of data revealed that top areas of change in participants’ knowledge were in the flipped classroom approach (increased by 79%), effective mentoring practices (67%), and elements of effective course goals and objectives (58%). Leading areas of change in skills were in developing goals and objectives (72%), using case-based learning (67%), and engaging learners through PowerPoint (64%). Change in attitudes was largest in the areas of effective mentoring and strong leadership (27%), using course and lecture learning objectives (26%), and student-centered learning theory (26%). Qualitative data revealed that participants were satisfied with the course; found the structure, presentations, and delivery methods to be effective; and appreciated the flexibility of being online but experienced challenges, particularly in connectivity. Discussion: This evaluation demonstrated the efficacy of using e-learning in East Africa and highlights the innovation of online faculty development in a region where it has not been done before. By using participants as future instructors, this course is scalable in the region and worldwide, and it can help address limited access to training by providing a critical mass of trainers competent in teaching, mentoring, and leading. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Continuing professional development (CPD) can be a critical driver of change to improve quality of care, health inequities, and system change. In order for CPD to address these disparities in care for patient populations most affected in the health care system, CPD programs must first address issues of equity and inclusion in their education development and delivery. Despite the need for equitable and inclusive CPD programs, there remains a paucity of tools and frameworks available in the literature to guide CPD and broader education providers on how best to develop and deliver equitable and inclusive education programs. In this article, we describe the development and application of a Health Equity and Inclusion (HEI) Framework for education and training grounded in the Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, and Evaluate model for instructional design. Using a case example, specifically a hospital-wide trauma-informed de-escalation for safety program, we demonstrate how the HEI Framework can be applied practically to CPD programs to support equity and inclusion in the planning, development, implementation, and evaluation phases of education program delivery. The case example illustrates how the HEI Framework can be used by CPD providers to respect learner diversity, improve accessibility for all learners, foster inclusion, and address biases and stereotypes. We suggest that the HEI Framework can serve as an educational resource for CPD providers and health professions educators aiming to create equitable and inclusive CPD programs. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

In this study, a questionnaire to measure InterProfessional collaborative Practice for Integrated Hospital care (IPPIH) has been developed and validated. Methods: A four-step iterative process was conducted: (1) literature search to find suitable questionnaires; (2) semistructured stakeholder interviews (individual and in focus groups) to discuss the topics and questions (face validity), (3) pretesting the prototype of the questionnaire in two different integrated care pathways for feasibility, usability, and internal consistency, and (4) testing (content and construct validity and responsiveness) of the revised questionnaire in eight integrated care pathways; the validation and responsiveness was tested by means of exploratory factor analysis, calculation of Cronbach alpha, item analysis, and linear mixed model analysis. Results: Based on six questionnaires and the opinion of direct stakeholders, the questionnaire IPPIH comprised 27 items. Five different domains could be distinguished: own skills, culture, coordination and collaboration, practical support, and appreciation with the Cronbach alpha varied from 0.91 to 0.48. The self-reported intensity of the collaboration within a specific care pathway significantly influenced the outcome (P = .000). Discussion: The product is a questionnaire, IPPIH, which can measure the degree of interprofessional collaborative practice in integrated hospital care pathways. The IPPIH was initially developed for quality assurance.

We argue that the heuristic use of frameworks to design and implement interventions tends to conceptualize context as defined lists of barriers, which may obscure consideration of how different contextual factors interact with and intersect with each other. Methods: We suggest a framework approach that would benefit from postmodernist theory that explores how ideologies, meanings, and social structures in health care settings shape social practices. As an illustrative example, we conducted a Foucauldian discourse analysis of diabetes care to make visible how the social, historical, and political conditions in which clinicians experience, practice, and shape possibilities for behavior change. Results: The discursive construction of continuing education as a knowledge translation mechanism assumes and is contingent on family physicians to implement guidelines. However, they enact other discursively constituted roles that may run in opposition. This paradoxical position creates a tension that must be navigated by family physicians, who may perceive it possible to provide good care without necessarily implementing guidelines. Discussion: We suggest marrying “framework” thinking with postmodernist theory that explores how ideologies, meanings, and social structures shape practice behavior change. Such a proposed reconceptualization of context in the design of continuing professional development interventions could provide a more robust and nuanced understanding of how the dynamic relationships and interactions between clinicians, patients, and their work environments shape educational effectiveness.

The intensive care unit (ICU), where multiprofessional teamwork is essential to patient care, represents an ideal training environment in which to study this role. This study aimed to describe the practices, perceptions, and attitudes of ICU nurses regarding teaching medical residents and to identify potential targets to facilitate nurse teaching. Methods: Using a concurrent mixed-methods approach, we administered surveys and focus groups to ICU nurses from September to November 2019 at a single, urban, tertiary, academic medical center. Survey data were analyzed with descriptive and comparative statistics. Focus group data were analyzed using the Framework method of content analysis. Results: Of nurses surveyed, 75 of 96 (78%) responded. Nurses generally held positive attitudes about teaching residents, describing it as both important (52%, 36/69) and enjoyable (64%, 44/69). Nurses reported confidence in both clinical knowledge base (80%, 55/69) and teaching skills (71%, 49/69), but identified time, uncertainty about teaching topics, and trainee receptiveness as potential barriers. Ten nurses participated in focus groups. Qualitative analysis revealed three major themes: nurse-specific factors that impact teaching, the teaching environment, and facilitators of teaching. Discussion: ICU nurses carry positive attitudes about teaching residents, particularly when facilitated by the attending, but this enthusiasm can be attenuated by the learning environment, unknown learner needs, and trainee attitudes. Identified facilitators of nurse teaching, including resident presence at the bedside and structured opportunities for teaching, represent potential targets for interventions to promote interprofessional teaching.

A 9-month virtual program with monthly 2-hour interactive sessions was designed, covering topics such as Leadership in Research, Mentoring, Building Diverse and Inclusive Teams, Managing Conflict, Influencing without Authority, Grant Administration, and Management. An anonymized survey was sent to participants before and after completion of the program, and the results were compared using the chi-squared test. Over a 2-year period, we selected two cohorts of 41 and 46 participants, respectively. After completion of the program, 92% of survey respondents indicated that the program met their expectations and 74% had made use of skills they learned. Participants enjoyed meeting new people and discussing common challenges. There was an increase in participants’ perceived understanding of personal leadership qualities, mentoring, communication, conflict resolution, grant management, and collaboration with industry (P < .05). A leadership development program for early-stage investigators led to a significant increase in participants’ perceived understanding of personal leadership qualities and competencies. It also offered participants the opportunity to meet other researchers in the institution and discuss common challenges.

We examined whether health professionals completing a 2-day workshop, with 3 to 5 hours of personalized coaching, and twice-yearly group reflections sustained proficiency for the duration of a hip fracture rehabilitation trial and whether intervention was implemented as intended.Methods:A fidelity study was completed as part of a process evaluation of the trial that tested whether physical activity increased among hip fracture patients randomly allocated to receive MI (experimental) compared with dietary advice (control) over ten 30-minute sessions. Twelve health professionals (none were proficient in MI before trial commencement) delivered the intervention for up to 952 days. Two hundred experimental sessions (24% of all sessions, 83 patients) were randomly selected to evaluate proficiency using the MI Treatment Integrity scale; along with 20 control sessions delivered by four dietitians. Linear mixed-effects regression analyses determined whether proficiency was sustained over time. Dose was assessed from all experimental sessions (n = 840, 98 patients).Results:Intervention was implemented as intended; 82% of patients received at least eight 30-minute sessions. All motivational interviewers were proficient, whereas dietitians did not inadvertently deliver MI. Time had no effect on MI proficiency (est < 0.001/d, P =.913, 95% CI, -0.001 to 0.001).Discussion:MI proficiency was sustained in a large trial over 2.6 years by completing a 2-day workshop, 3 to 5 hours of personalized coaching, and twice-yearly group reflections, even for those without previous experience; further research needs to establish the maximum duration of training effectiveness. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

However, there is scarce literature on CPD leadership. We set out to study what CPD leadership means and describe the competencies required for CPD leadership. Methods: A scoping review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses extension guidelines for scoping reviews guidelines was conducted. With librarian support, four databases were searched for publications related to leadership, medical education, and CPD. Publications were screened by two reviewers and three reviewers extracted data. Results: Among 3886 publications, 46 were eligible for a full-text review and 13 met the final inclusion criteria. There was no agreed upon definition of CPD leadership and variable models and approaches to leadership in the literature. Contextual issues shaping CPD (eg, funding, training, and information technology) are evolving. We identified several attitudes and behaviors (eg, strategic thinking), skills (eg, collaboration), and knowledge (eg, organizational awareness) important to CPD leadership, but no established set of unique competencies. Discussion: These results offer the CPD community a foundation on which competencies, models, and training programs can build. This work suggests the need to build consensus on what CPD leadership means, what CPD leaders do, and what they will need to create and sustain change. We suggest the adaptation of existing leadership frameworks to a CPD context to better guide leadership and leadership development programs.

Assessment is pervasive throughout the life of an individual health professional, serving many different purposes compounded by varied and unique contexts, each with their own drivers and consequences, usually casting the person as the object of assessment. Assessment is often assumed as an included part in CPD development conceptualization. Research on assessment in CPD is often focused on systems, utility, and quality instead of intentionally examining the link between assessment and the person. We present an alternative view of assessment in CPD as person-centered, practice-informed, situated and bound by capability, and enacted in social and material contexts. With this lens of assessment as an inherently personal experience, we introduce the concept of subjectification, as described by educationalist Gert Biesta. We propose that subjectification may be a fruitful way of examining assessment in a CPD context. Although the CPD community, researchers, and educators consider this further, we offer some early implications of adopting a subjectification lens on the design and enactment of assessment in CPD. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This survey research aimed to verify the preferred sources of information for acquiring knowledge about physiotherapy and the association between types of information source and barriers in EBP implementation.Methods:A total of 610 physiotherapists were included and answered an online questionnaire about the preferred sources for searching physiotherapy-related information and possible barriers in EBP implementation.Results:Physiotherapists reported scientific resources as the preferred source of information, scientific databases (31%), followed by scientific articles (25%). The main barrier cited in EBP implementation was the difficulty in obtaining full-text articles (34%), followed by lack of statistical knowledge (30%). The use of peer-reviewed resources as the most preferred source of information is associated with the presence of issues in comprehending scientific information.Discussion:Although the positive attitude toward the use of scientific information, the findings raised question regarding the proper translation of scientific information to clinical practice. The importance of scientific information seems to be a well-established attitude among physiotherapists.

Previous studies using online NGTs (ONGTs) in health have been conducted in regions of high population density and internet connectivity. This activity aimed to determine the feasibility and utility of ONGTs in gathering opinion and reaching consensus on curriculum topics for a continuing research education program for health professionals dispersed across various locations in Southern Queensland. Methods: Fifteen clinical education academics from a range of health professions participated in 1-hour ONGT sessions from 2 University Department of Rural Health sites or their home offices. The traditional NGT was adapted for online use, using two free online platforms (Zoom for videoconferencing and Wooclap for voting and response collation). Results: The chosen platforms were effective in presenting ONGTs, allowing active and effective contributions to research topic ideas from all participants, including those with low internet connectivity. Silent generation enabled sharing, open discussion, and clarification of generated ideas. Wooclap was effective in reviewing and voting on generated responses and providing real-time feedback on voting outcomes. Outcomes were consistent with group consensus and useful in prioritizing research training topics. Discussion: The modified ONGT is effective in gathering opinion and gaining consensus from a geographically dispersed health workforce with varied levels of internet connectivity and experience with online platforms. It represents a cost-effective and time-effective alternative to face-to-face NGTs that is less likely to be affected by workforce disruptions. © 2024 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205470296"

In this program evaluation, we explore the effects of a synchronous online continuing medical education program (Self-Compassion for Healthcare Communities, SCHC) to improve physician burnout and related outcomes. Methods: The SCHC program was delivered online via Zoom and consisted of six 1-hour weekly sessions to enhance self-compassion and well-being. The primary outcome was the “burnout” subscale of the Professional Quality of Life scale; compassion satisfaction, secondary traumatic stress, self-compassion, resilience activation and decompression, and job satisfaction were evaluated, and qualitative data were also collected. Results: A total of 116 physicians attended at least one session of the program, 48 of whom completed both the preprogram and postprogram surveys. The results showed that physicians experienced a reduction in their burnout levels (P = .001) as well as improvements in compassion satisfaction (P = .027), secondary traumatic stress (P = .001), self-compassion (P < .001), resilience decompression (P = .012), and job satisfaction (P = .038). Qualitative data, obtained from a total of 91 participants who attended at least one session, indicated that participants were satisfied with the SCHC program: they found it useful for learning to be compassionate with themselves and they highly valued having the chance to connect with other colleagues who experience similar struggles. Discussion: The live online SCHC program showed benefits on physician burnout and related outcomes such as compassion satisfaction, secondary traumatic stress, self-compassion, resilience decompression, and job satisfaction. Nonetheless, in addition to individual-focused well-being programs, systemic changes in health care delivery were also deemed necessary to decrease burnout. © 2024 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205513720"

Physicians and other clinicians increasingly practice within complex health care delivery organizations aiming to improve the care of populations of patients with multiple problems and differing needs. These organizations are composed of local units in different departments and venues; these teams and the patients they care for change over time. Improving outcomes within constantly changing complex organizations delivering population care takes time and persistence. It takes time to equip critical masses of clinicians and other personnel with knowledge and skills to effect change. Although some changes might be simple, those involving new workflows require implementation support. Not all change will be smooth; individuals need opportunities to learn from and adjust their early intervention efforts, measure effectiveness of change, and sustain successful practices. Longitudinal support is necessary to affect change over complex organizations. This essay proposes that to be more supportive and valuable to health care delivery organizations, continuing professional development needs to intentionally participate in longitudinal, collaborative, context-specific, team-based interventions. An expanded menu of evaluation approaches will better describe the role of continuing professional development in helping health care professionals and organizations address increasingly complex health care delivery problems and improve patient and population outcomes. Selected concepts to achieve these ends are introduced at a high level in this article.

While data-driven AE performance measurement and feedback (PMF) as a form of continuing professional development (CPD) has been presented as a possible approach to continuous quality improvement (CQI), little is known about the barriers and facilitators that influence surgeons' engagement and uptake of these CPD programs. The purpose of this knowledge translation informed CPD study was to examine surgeons' perspectives of the challenges and facilitators to participating in surgical CQI with the broader objective of enhancing future improvements of such CPD interventions.Methods:Using Everett Rogers diffusion of innovations framework as a sampling frame, the participants were recruited across five surgical divisions. An exploratory case study approach, including in-depth semistructured interviews, was employed. Interview transcripts were analyzed and directly coded using the Theoretical Domains Framework.Results:Directed coding yielded a total of 527 coded barriers and facilitators to behavior change pertaining to the implementation and adoption of PMF with the majority of barriers and facilitators coded in four key theoretical domains environmental context and resources, social influences, knowledge, and beliefs about consequences. A key barrier was the lack of support from the hospital necessitating surgeons' self-funding their own PMF programs. Facilitators included having a champion to drive CQI and using seminars to facilitate discussions around CQI principles and practices.Discussion:This study identified multiple barriers and facilitators to surgeons' engagement and uptake of a data-driven PMF system in surgery. A key finding of the study was the identification of the influential role of positive deviance seminars as a quality improvement and patient safety mechanism that encourages surgeon engagement in PMF systems. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Using smart glasses (SG) to provide educators with a first-person learner perspective has not been explored in faculty development such as Objective Structured Teaching Exercises (OSTEs).Methods:Integrated within a 6-session continuing medical education-bearing certificate course, this descriptive study involved one session where participants provided feedback to a standardized student in an OSTE. Participants were recorded by mounted wall cameras (MWCs) and SG. They received verbal feedback on their performance based on a self-designed assessment tool. Participants reviewed the recorded content and identified areas for improvement, completed a survey about their experience with SG, and wrote a narrative reflection.Results:Seventeen physicians at the assistant professor level participated in the session; data were analyzed on the 14 who had both MWC and SG recordings and who also completed the survey and reflection. All were comfortable with the standardized student wearing SG and indicated it did not affect communication. Eighty-five percent of the participants felt the SG provided additional feedback not available with the MWC, with majority noting additional feedback was related to eye contact, body language, voice inflection, and tone. Eighty-six percent see value in using SG for faculty development, and 79% felt that periodically using SG in their teaching would improve quality.Conclusion:Use of SG during an OSTE on giving feedback was a nondistracting and positive experience. SG provided affective feedback otherwise not perceived from a standard MWC. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Research has mostly examined narrative comments on resident evaluations of their supervisors. This study aimed to explore supervisors' and residents' beliefs and experiences with upward feedback, along with recommendations to initiate and facilitate effective conversations.Methods:Using 60-minute focus group discussions, a previous study explored opinions of internal medicine residents and clinical supervisors at the Brigham and Women's Hospital regarding the impact of institutional culture on feedback conversations. For this study, we conducted a thematic analysis of the transcribed, anonymous data to identify key concepts pertaining only to verbal upward feedback, through the theoretical lens of Positioning theory.Results:Twenty-two supervisors and 29 residents participated in three and five focus groups, respectively. Identified themes were mapped to three research questions regarding (1) existing beliefs (lack of impact, risks to giving supervisors feedback, need for preparation and reflection), (2) experiences (nonspecific language, avoidance of upward feedback, bypassing the supervisor), and (3) recommended approaches (setting clear expectations, seeking specific feedback, emphasizing interest in growth).Discussion:Study participants appeared to assume learner-teacher positions during feedback conversations, resulting in residents' concerns of adverse consequences, beliefs that supervisors will neither accept feedback nor change their behaviors, and avoidance of constructive upward feedback. Residents suggested that emphasis on mutual professional growth and regular feedback seeking by supervisors could encourage them to take on the role of feedback providers. Their recommendations could be a valuable starting point for faculty development initiatives on upward feedback. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This study focuses on determining whether a defensible cut score for the influenza vaccination training multiple-choice questions examination is feasible.Methods:Influenza vaccination training and assessment happened on the same day. The Angoff (modified), Beuk, and Hofstee methods were used for standard-setting. Six subject matter experts who were involved in developing and conducting the first influenza vaccination training in the UAE evaluated the cut score using the Angoff method with the Delphi technique.Results:The criterion-based cut score was 34.23 of 46 questions, with mean 74% and SD 2.24. Inter-rater reliability was 0.92 with standard errors of judgment 0.29 (0.63%).Discussion:The modified Angoff is a credible method to set cut scores, reassured with Beuk and Hofstee methods for assessment of influenza continuing education.

Among providers, burnout is a state of exhaustion including heightened depersonalization; among patients, burnout can negatively affect clinical outcomes.More than half of clinical providers in the United States suffer from burnout; less is known about themagnitude and prevalence among patients. Understanding patient burnout will improve our recognition of treatment barriers, understanding of patientprovider communication, and perceived quality of care. The purpose of the 2019 Stanford University MedicineX BurnoutWorkgroup was to use a collaborative approach to expand on the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) Wellness and Resilience Model, which does not currently include the patient as an influential member of the care team potentially experiencing burnout. This collaboration among patients, physicians, students, caregivers, technologists, and researchers used a convenience sample of conference attendees, broken into three focus groups to (1) provide an expanded definition of burnout that includes patients' perspectives, (2) analyze the NAM burnout model for inclusion of the patient experience, and (3) define a care experience that includes both patients and providers. The design of this workgroup was informed by Everyone Included, a model that recognizes and rejects hierarchical traditions in clinical practice. This approach allowed for the creation of a safe space for the exchange of knowledge between the various stakeholders.

The Physicians Leadership Academy provides integrated leadership seminars, mindfulness training, and executive coaching in a 10-month curriculum to physicians across area organizations.Methods:Program evaluators responded to stakeholders' need for continuous program improvement by developing a continuous feedback loop evaluation design incorporating a program monitoring system and a theory-driven program evaluation. Given the size of the 2019 to 20 cohort (n = 19), a one-group pretest/posttest design was used to assess the mechanisms of the program (mindfulness and wellbeing) along with knowledge development, emotional intelligence, and personal and professional growth. The assessments used a combination of published and administrator-developed assessments to address the unique aspects of the program. Doing such ensured continuous improvement and sustainability for the program.Results:The cohort of physicians demonstrated significant engagement and learning across the curriculum, improved mindfulness, and improved capacity of the providers to affect their health care system and communities.Conclusions:The utility of the program was demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative analyses.

We evaluated how a centralized departmental research group affected the scholarly productivity of faculty on and off the tenure track.Methods:A research team providing both mentorship and logistical study support was implemented in 2018. We identified a pre-intervention cohort of physician faculty employed in July 2016, and a postintervention cohort, employed in July 2018. A publication search was conducted for these cohorts in the period 2017 to 2018 and 2019 to 2020, respectively.Results:Seventy-five faculty were included in the analysis, with approximately two-thirds appointed on the clinical (nontenure) track. In the pre-intervention cohort (n = 59), 15 faculty (25%) had at least one publication in the period 2017 to 2018. In the postintervention cohort (n = 59), 33 faculty (56%) published at least one article in the period 2019 to 2020 (P =.001). Multivariable random-effects regression analysis confirmed that postintervention, odds of publishing in a given year increased for both clinical-track and tenure-track faculty.Conclusion:Both clinical and tenure-track faculty contribute to the academic mission at medical schools, yet scholarly activity is supported and rewarded for tenure-track faculty more often than for clinical-track faculty.

In health care systems where continuing professional development is not integral to practice, clinicians may have few opportunities. We describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of a professional development program in patient safety for Japanese clinical educators to acquire simulation instructional skills and become Patient Safety Champions at their organizations. Methods: Mixed methods were used in a longitudinal pre/post study design. The Kirkpatrick evaluation model was used to evaluate outcomes of a workshop, overall program, on-site training experiences, and impact as Patient Safety Champions. Self-assessment data on skills and knowledge of patient safety, simulation instructional methods, interprofessional collaboration, and leadership were collected and analyzed. Results: Eighty-nine percent of participants facilitated on-site patient safety training within 6 months of workshop completion. Skills and knowledge improvement were observed immediately postworkshop in four categories: patient safety, simulation instructional methods, interprofessional collaboration and communication, and leadership as a patient safety champion. Skills and knowledge increased at 6 months after facilitation of on-site safety training. Program mean satisfaction scores ranged from 84% to 92%. Mean Patient Safety Champion in-facility evaluations were 4.2 to 4.7 on a 5-point scale. Discussion: High levels of knowledge, skill retention, and behavior change are attributed to goal setting, outcome-oriented pedagogy, and reflective sessions. The Patient Safety Champion model and experiential learning approach gave Japanese clinical educators in medicine, nursing, and pharmacy an opportunity to learn from each other in simulations reflecting the practice environment.

In March 2018, 58 of 102 counties in Illinois lacked access to medication for OUD.Methods:Rush University created a fellowship training program with financial incentives to help expand buprenorphine treatment in Illinois. Fellows first completed an online waiver course, then attended an in-person intensive training weekend, and finally participated in a 9-month webinar series. Demographic and prescribing data were collected from fellows, as well as a comparison group of providers outside the fellowship who only completed a waiver training.Results:At the fellowship's end, 31 of 37 fellows (84%) reported they were actively prescribing buprenorphine. Of the 23 fellows who were not prescribing at the fellowship's beginning, 17 (74%) initiated prescribing by the end. Among the 16 nonfellowship subjects who only completed a waiver training, just two (13%) reported they were prescribing buprenorphine at the study period's end.Discussion:Our study indicates that providers need more training beyond the waiver to initiate buprenorphine prescribing.

However, knowledge of how leaders with power and influence in hospital organizations promote the means for continuous learning in practice is scarce. This study aims to explore how key stakeholders in a hospital organization think about approaches and roles when promoting the reflective practice in small groups as means for continuous professional development in their organizations.Methods:Six key stakeholders from a regional hospital (two department directors, two ward managers, and two resident supervisors) were recruited through purposive sampling. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, and an abductive content analysis was performed.Results:In the current study, leaders stressed that cultural and structural conditions at all levels in the system were important for the practice of small-group learning. Yet, their suggested approaches referred exclusively to a limited part of the system and were directed to staff at lower hierarchical levels within their jurisdictions.Discussion:The identified gap between the suggested approaches and the claimed conditions for implementing a new strategy for continuous professional development among leaders in a health care organization illuminates difficulties in the implementation process. Providing adequate conditions at all levels of the system demands implementation approaches that include the entire hospital system. This requires that leaders first recognize their need to learn and apply a systemic perspective, and second, that they can create such learning opportunities for themselves. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

In this report, we describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of a QI training program for faculty in hospital medicine at an academic medical center aimed at increasing faculty capacity in QI.Methods:With input from an initial focus group of hospital medicine faculty, we developed a 12-session, active-learning curriculum incorporating core concepts in QI applied to a real-life QI problem. We used a survey instrument to assess changes in self-reported confidence, the Quality Improvement Knowledge Application Tool-Revised to assess changes in applied knowledge, and a second focus group to obtain qualitative feedback regarding the curriculum.Results:Self-reported confidence in numerous QI skills increased after completion of the curriculum; however, concurrent improvement in applied knowledge was not observed. Qualitatively, participants not only described improved understanding of QI methodology and greater confidence contributing to QI initiatives but also a sense they were not prepared to lead a QI project independently.Discussion:An active-learning faculty training program is feasible with limited resources and was associated with increased faculty confidence in QI skills. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Therefore, we created a novel Primary Care Champions fellowship program that provides practical experiences in education, practice transformation, and leadership for primary care physicians and physician assistants in community practice. The purpose of this study is to describe the fellowship and evaluate feedback from the first cohort.Methods:In the Jefferson Primary Care Champions Fellowship, fellows are provided protected time from clinical obligations to engage in didactic, informal, and experiential learning. They meet monthly and participate in student precepting training and receive mentorship from senior clinician administrators, scientists, educators, and population health researchers to hone skills for leadership and practice transformation endeavors. Cohort one began in September 2018. All fellows were family physicians from community-based practices in Philadelphia, PA (N = 4) and selected in collaboration with their practice leadership. Mixed-methods postprogram evaluations included Organizational Readiness Assessment and qualitative feedback.Results:Fellows denoted individual time, small-group mentorship, protected project time, and open-robust discussions about primary care most useful. Three fellows reported that they plan to continue their practice-improvement projects postfellowship and one published her initial project findings and reflections.Discussion:Overall feedback from the first cohort was positive. Fellows greatly appreciated structured time to explore primary care interests, contemplated long-term career prospects, and considered leadership opportunities.

Many dietitians do not feel confident to practice effectively in these settings and require improved workforce development opportunities. Communities of Practice can improve dietitians' confidence and practice in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health; however, evidence for long-term impacts is limited. This study aims to determine if a Community of Practice can have long-term impacts on dietitians working in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health.Methods:Data were collected through semistructured interviews and a cultural awareness self-assessment tool. Analysis was through a multimethod approach and combined qualitative inductive thematic analysis, social network analysis, and descriptive statistics.Results:Three main areas of long-term impact were identified including development of a social and professional network, career progression and retention, and a fundamental change in thinking and practice. All participants experienced feelings of support and increased confidence.Discussion:Communities of practice may be a feasible, low-cost workforce development strategy that can reduce dietitians' feelings of professional isolation when working in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. Further research is required to identify the mechanisms underlying sustained impacts. Social network analysis, combined with realist evaluation may be an appropriate research design, to answer future and more in-depth questions about the effectiveness of communities of practice. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

CME activities are designed to address professional knowledge or practice gaps. The authors examined participants' ""intent to change"" after CME activities to evaluate whether CME activity content was suitably linked with the stated learning objectives.Methods:The authors performed a retrospective mixed-methods thematic content analysis of written and electronic records from American Association of Neurological Surgeons-sponsored CME activities. Data from 2011 through 2016 were analyzed using a quantitative, deductive content analysis approach. Data were examined for each year separately as well as longitudinally over the six consecutive years. Intent-To-change data that did not align with meeting objectives were analyzed inductively using a qualitative content analysis approach to explore potential unintended learning themes.Results:The authors examined 85 American Association of Neurological Surgeons CME activities (424 CME objectives). The objectives were compared with 1950 intent-To-change statements. Thematic patterns of recurrent intent-To-change statements that matched with CME objectives included topics of resident education, complication avoidance, clinical best practices and evidence, new innovations, and novel surgical techniques. Just over a third of intent-To-change statements (37.3%) were not related to any meeting objective. Approximately a quarter of these unmatched statements led to new learning objectives in subsequent years.Conclusions:An examination of CME learning objectives and participant intent-To-change statements provides information for examination of both meeting planner and learner attitudes for future CME activity planning. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Collaborative engagement in an interprofessional community of practice is crucial to the collective competence of a team and the provision of high-quality, safe health care leading to improved patient outcomes. The objective of this descriptive, cross-sectional study was to describe interprofessional communication, coordination, and collaboration of participants in an integrated practice unit that was structured to include weekly case conferences as part of routine practice.Methods:Data were collected from October 2019 to February 2020. Web-based surveys were administered to a convenience sample that included 33 questions and followed the CHERRIES checklist for reporting results. Items focused on team knowledge, impact on patient care, and communication, and conference focus and effectiveness. Descriptive and survey item analysis included frequency, percentage, means and standard deviation, Chi-square, and Pearson correlation analysis. Patient outcome data were collected via a Patient Global Impression of Improvement scale and were analyzed using a paired sample t test.Results:Survey respondents (n = 161) included clinicians and administrative staff. Results demonstrated that interprofessional case conferences improved the collective competence of the team, including team knowledge and communication. Participants viewed case conferences as a means to enhance care delivery quality, value, safety, and equity. In the study period, there was also a statistically significant improvement between the patient's first follow-up and last visits.Conclusion:Survey respondents indicated that case conferences were an effective means to deliver high-quality, patient-centered care through interprofessional collaboration and education. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

ECHO Autism: Center Engagement is a program that promotes improvement in autism care by improving the management of autism care centers. The program's focus brought experienced clinicians together as both facilitators and participants in an ECHO series. ECHO Autism: Center Engagement facilitators devised a reflective writing exercise to prospectively study their experience leading this new curriculum.Methods:Drawing on a qualitative thematic analysis of longitudinal reflective writing exercises from seven ""Hub Team"" facilitators, we describe how ECHO leaders cultivate a learning environment that emphasizes shared learning and acknowledges the expertise of ECHO participants.Results:The analysis generated three main themes: (1) Hub Team facilitators valued reciprocal exchange with Spoke sites, a theme we name ""shared learning,"" (2) Hub Team facilitators demonstrated high levels of awareness about their facilitation styles, and (3) Hub Team facilitators cultivated an interactional style they described as ""all teach, all learn.""Discussion:Examining the experiences of ECHO facilitators produces qualitative accounts of continuing professional development that may not be captured in other program evaluation approaches. In the case of ECHO Autism: Center Engagement, facilitators cultivated an environment of shared learning, which acknowledged the expertise of both facilitators and participants. These findings are pertinent for scholars of continuing education in health professions who lead educational programs where participants and facilitators have high levels of overlap in their areas of expertise and years of experience. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Search strategy was developed using MeSH headings. The following data sources were searched: Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, MEDLINE, and Ovid full text (between May 2007 and May 2019) (one reviewer with librarian support) plus manual searching. Screening, data extraction, and evaluation were undertaken independently by two reviewers. Studies were independently appraised for quality by two reviewers to identify concepts which were compared and developed into a conceptual model by the team.Results:Thirteen studies (937 participants) were included. Findings explored peer review processes and three key components, namely, purpose, process, and peers. Participants' perceptions of peer review processes were categorized by four main concepts: value/benefits, reflection/shared learning, anxiety about the process, and how to improve ""buy-in.""Discussion:Evidence supports the introduction and use of peer review processes as a quality improvement tool. Further research exploring whether/how to incorporate peer review processes into the process of assessing continuing fitness to practice for allied health professionals seems appropriate.

Our organization recognized the importance of offering more practice assessment opportunities to our members to enhance their practice and help them comply with a regulation from our provincial professional body related to ongoing continuing education. This led us to rethink our annual congress and enrich the program with a curriculum of interdisciplinary simulation sessions tailored to meet the needs of a broad audience of specialists. Our challenges are similar to those of many national specialty societies having limited access to simulation facilities, instructors, and simulation teams that can cover the breadth and scope of perceived and unperceived simulation needs for their specialty. Our innovative solution was to partner with local experts to develop 22 simulation sessions over the past three years. The response was very positive, drawing 867 participants. Over 95% of participants either agreed or strongly agreed that their simulation session (1) met their learning objectives, (2) was relevant for their practice, and (3) encouraged them to modify their practice. Narrative comments from a survey sent to the 2018 participants four months after their activity indicated several self-reported changes in their practice or patient outcomes. We were able to centralize offers from organizations that had previously worked in silo to develop simulation sessions meeting the needs of our members. Proposing simulation sessions allowed our organization to establish long-term partnerships and to expend our ""educational toolbox"" to address skill gaps not usually addressed during annual meetings. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This has resulted in a considerable digital divide between patient care and education, one that poorly serves practitioners and organizations, even as learning becomes ever more important to both. In this perspective, we advocate for the enhancement of existing health information systems so that they intentionally facilitate learning. We describe three well-regarded frameworks for learning that can point toward how health care information systems can best evolve to support learning. The Master Adaptive Learner model suggests ways that the individual practitioner can best organize their activities to ensure continual self-improvement. The PDSA cycle similarly proposes actions for improvement but at a health care organization's workflow level. Senge's Five Disciplines of the Learning Organization, a more general framework from the business literature, serves to further inform how disparate information and knowledge flows can be managed for continual improvement. Our main thesis holds that these types of learning frameworks should inform the design and integration of information systems serving the health professions. An underutilized mediator of educational improvement is the ubiquitous electronic health record. The authors list learning analytic opportunities, including potential modifications of learning management systems and the electronic health record, that would enhance health professions education and support the shared goal of delivering high-quality evidence-based health care. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The rationale for and components of the pilot program are presented along with data on participant performance and feedback from the first year of implementation in three primary specialties (neurology, child neurology, and psychiatry) and one subspecialty (child and adolescent psychiatry).Methods:Evaluation of the pilot program was guided by a widely used validity framework. Data were collected that addressed the five categories of validity evidence: Content, response process, internal structure, relation to other variables, and consequences.Results:Enrollment ranged from 66.7% for psychiatrists to 75.3% for child neurologists. For the 2019 cohort, the pass rates ranged from 92.6% for child and adolescent psychiatry to 98.7% for neurology, and very small numbers of diplomates failed or did not complete the process. For psychiatrists, there was a modest, but significant, relationship between performance on previous and subsequent maintenance of certification examinations. Ninety percent or more agreed that: The articles were easy to access and helpful to their practices; the mini-tests were a fair assessment of their understanding of the articles; and their test-taking experience was satisfactory.Discussion:Most eligible diplomates participated in the article-based pilot project, and they strongly preferred this format to the traditional multiple-choice examinations. Most important, the pilot was perceived to be a meaningful and relevant learning activity that had a positive effect on patient care. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

A survey link was sent to nonrespondents at 2 weeks and 4 weeks. All participants were deidentified. The identification of a mentor was compared by gender, academic rank, and years of practice.Results:Among 233 anesthesiologists, 103 (44.2%) responded to the survey. More than 90% of survey respondents agreed or strongly agreed that having a mentor is important to career success. Of the 103 respondents, 31 (30%) indicated they had a mentor. Overall, 84% of the identified mentors were men; however, this percentage differed significantly between men and women respondents (95% versus 60%; P =.03). Characteristics associated with having a mentor included younger age (P =.007), fewer years since finishing training (P =.004), and working full time (P =.02). For respondent age and years since finishing training, there was some evidence that the association was dependent on the gender of the respondent (age-by-gender interaction, P =.08; experience-by-gender interaction, P =.08).Discussion:Anesthesiologists in this department believed that mentorship led to more academic success. Few women mentors were reported, and women were unlikely to identify a mentor once advanced past an assistant professor rank. Most respondents believed that mentorship was important for overall career success, but only approximately one-third identified a mentor at the time of the survey. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The goal of this intervention was to develop a training course that improves physician understanding of trauma-sensitive care in the emergency department and equips physicians with knowledge of the specialized care required to treat SA survivors.Methods:Thirty-nine attending emergency physicians underwent a 4-hour training on trauma-sensitive care for survivors of SA and completed prequestionnaires and postquestionnaires to assess training efficacy in improving knowledge base and comfort level providing care. The training consisted of didactic portions focused on the neurobiology of trauma, communication skills, and forensic evidence collection techniques and a simulation portion with standardized patients to practice evidence collection and a trauma-sensitive anogenital examination.Results:Physicians demonstrated significantly improved performance (P <.05) on 12 of 18 knowledge-based questions. Physicians also showed significant improvement (P <.001) on 11 of 11 Likert scale questions that assessed comfort level communicating with survivors and using trauma-sensitive techniques during medical and forensic examinations.Conclusion:Physicians who received the training course demonstrated a significantly improved knowledge base and comfort level treating survivors of SA. Considering the prevalence of sexual violence, it is imperative that physicians are appropriately educated on trauma-sensitive care. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Inadequate management of this substance can constitute an occupational hazard by exposing health care professionals to health risks including memory loss, psychosomatic symptoms, fatigue, and other signs of cognitive dysfunction as reported in several studies.Purpose:To assess Mexico's health care professionals' health and mercury-related knowledge and risk perception and to explore the measurement properties of a questionnaire assessing that level of knowledge.Materials and Methods:Mixed methodology. A quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted to measure health care professionals' knowledge of mercury and to validate an instrument using a Rasch analysis in 160 professionals. A qualitative study involving in-depth interviews was conducted to identify participants' risk perception for mercury exposure.Results:The total knowledge of mercury was 19.0 ± 2.0 on a scale of 0 to 28 points. The scores for medical specialists were significantly (P <.001) higher, ranging between 20.0 ± 2.05 and 23.0 ± 1.63. In general, the level of risk perception for mercury exposure was low. The questionnaire presented a reasonable fit to the Rasch model (good item fit with a Bonferroni-adjusted P =.000714). The response categories of three items were collapsed, and two pairs of items were bundled into two super items.Conclusion:The levels of the knowledge of the health and safety risks and risk perception for mercury exposure in the Mexican health care professionals evaluated were low. Health care professionals should receive comprehensive training in the safe use and health risks of mercury. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Managing a polarity is a thorny endeavor because it entails striving to maximize the benefits of both poles while simultaneously minimizing or controlling the downsides of each. Previous investigations into stakeholder conceptualizations of remediation led us to suggest that remediation is framed in stakeholders' minds simultaneously as an educational endeavor (ie, the remediatee needs educational support to regain full competence) and a regulatory act (ie, the revocation of the individual's professional right to self-regulate their practice and learning). In this article, we argue that viewing remediation for practicing physicians as a polarity to be managed offers a framework that can further the conversation about how to address some of remediation's challenges. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Although many institutions offer training opportunities to health care professionals who wish to undertake KBs roles, the characteristics and content of those educational training opportunities (ETOs) are currently unknown. This study aimed to describe the ETOs available to rehabilitation professionals in Canada and determine whether the ETOs meet the competencies expected of the KBs roles.Methods:We conducted a Canada-wide environmental scan to identify ETOs using three strategies: Online search, phone calls, and snowball. To be included in the study, ETOs had to be offered to rehabilitation professionals in Canada and be targeting KBs competencies and/or roles. We mapped each of the content to the KBs competencies (knowledge and skills) within the five roles of KBs: Information manager, linking agent, capacity builder, facilitator, and evaluator.Results:A total of 51 ETOs offered in three Canadian provinces, British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, were included in the analysis. For KBs competencies, 76% of ETOs equipped attendees with research skills, 55% with knowledge brokering skills, and 53% with knowledge on implementation science. For KBs roles, over 60% of ETOs supported attendees to in performing the capacity builder role and 39% the evaluator role.Discussion:Findings suggest that ETOs focused primarily on preparing participants with the research and knowledge brokering skills required to perform the capacity builder and evaluator roles.

Continuing professional development (CPD), including faculty development, has the opportunity to leverage online technologies in a JiT format to further support learner engagement and program sustainability. In this article, the authors propose a model that can serve as a taxonomy for defining and implementing JiT continuing education (JiTCE). The anatomy of JiTCE describes four mechanisms to address CPD needs and delivery procedures: Perceived and unperceived, as well as pull and push (PUPP) taxonomy. JiTCE PUPP taxonomy defines four components for designing and developing a program with JiT: On-demand learning, subscription-based learning, performance feedback-driven learning, and data-driven learning. These methods, as backbones, use various online technologies, which offer fundamental support for JiTCE. Delivery systems and technologies are provided as specific examples for JiTCE throughout the article. JiTCE introduces a novel taxonomy to meet continuing education needs and provides an organized approach to design and deploy programming in a sustainable way. Online technologies are evolving everyday and are an indispensable part of both clinical practice and medical education. Pull-push and perceived-unperceived axes can help guide new opportunities for instructional designers and curriculum developers to leverage best practices to align with CPD offerings, which include cutting-edge technologies. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Yet, no previous research has identified potential barriers for KBs to promote the uptake of research evidence in rehabilitation settings. This study aimed to identify the barriers and facilitators for KBs in Canadian rehabilitation settings as perceived by individuals serving as KBs.Methods:Qualitative study using semistructured telephone interviews with individuals performing KB activities in rehabilitation settings across Canada. The interview topic guide was informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and consisted of 20 questions covering three domains (characteristics of individuals, inner setting, and outer settings). We conducted qualitative descriptive analysis combining deductive coding guided by the CFIR.Results:Characteristics of individuals included having communication skills, clinical experience, research skills, and interpersonal features, in addition to being confident and motivated and receiving training. The inner setting domain included having constant networking with stakeholders and being aware of stakeholders' needs, in addition to resources availability, leadership engagement, knowledge accessibility, prioritizing brokering activities, and monitoring KBs' performance. Finally, the outer setting domain showed that KBs need to be connected to a community of practice to promote information exchange and avoid work duplications.Discussion:Factors likely to hinder or promote the optimal use of KBs within Canadian rehabilitation settings include skill sets and networking abilities; organizational culture, resources, and leadership engagement; and the need for specific training for KBs and for evaluation tools to monitor their performance. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

In many settings, these activities are classified into two broad domains of ""quality improvement"" and ""health services research"" each with its own methods, continuing education, support structures, and governance systems. We aimed to explore differences and similarities in the purpose, methods, and outcomes of approved allied health projects conducted under each of these domains at a large metropolitan health network.Method:Using observational methods, we evaluated allied health quality improvement and research projects approved through the relevant governance systems in a single health network during a 12-month reporting period. Project leaders were surveyed, and project documentation was evaluated using the SQUIRE tool.Results:Allied health professionals were motivated to undertake both quality improvement (n = 13) and research projects (n = 15) to improve health care. Research projects were more likely to be disseminated externally, but quality improvement projects were more frequently reported to result in internal practice change. Methods were well documented for research projects, but this information was frequently lacking for quality improvement projects. Research projects were also more likely to be supported by external funding than quality improvement projects.Implications:Allied health clinicians conducting improvement activities using research and quality improvement projects share common goals. There are likely to be opportunities to enhance value and implementation of findings into practice by bridging the divide between health service research and quality improvement activities in health networks. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

These experiences can intensify feelings of grief in the professional setting, but the range of formal training that addresses personal illness or loss is unknown. This study aimed to explore interventions that teach health care providers and trainees about personal illness experience.Methods:A scoping review was conducted by searching three bibliographic databases using the terms ""illness,"" ""personal,"" ""education,"" and synonyms. Article screening was performed in duplicate to identify studies that described an intervention that included teaching or learning on personal experiences with illness or loss for health care providers and trainees.Results:The search yielded 4168 studies, of which 13 were included. Education most often targeted medical students (54%), resident or attending physicians (31%), and nurses (31%). Other participants included social workers and psychologists. Personal illness was most frequently taught for reflection in the context of palliative care curricula (54%). Only two studies' primary purpose was to teach about coping with grief related to personal experiences. No studies within the scope of our defined methodology described training on how to support colleagues or trainees facing personal illness or loss. Reported outcomes included improved coping skills, decreased stress, and better ability to support bereaving patients.Discussion:Specific training on personal illness experience is limited, with gaps in continuity of learning, particularly for continuing medical education. Future curricula can equip providers with coping strategies while enabling improved resilience and patient care. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

How can we refine the definition of scholarship so that it better aligns with the scope of current faculty practice within academic health systems? Revision of the academic policies for promotion and tenure at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School afforded an opportunity to redefine scholarship such that a broader platform was available for faculty recognition, aligning with current academic standards, yet providing flexibility for the future. The authors describe the historical context of the definition of scholarship and their institution's process to construct a definition of scholarship with three essential elements: Advancement of knowledge, dissemination for critical review, and impact on a discipline, practice, or community. Application of this definition to team science and digital scholarship is also described. Following a widespread continuing education initiative, implementation of the new definition within promotion and tenure processes of the medical, nursing, and graduate schools resulted in broad acceptance across the institution. This forum article provides lessons in leading an academic health sciences institution to reassess academic processes and is a resource for advancing the vigorous debate on the evolving meaning and evaluation of scholarship. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Four sets of factors are essential to the transfer of learning from CPD into practice: learner characteristics, instructional design, content, and environment. Through incorporating elements of educational theories/frameworks into the planning of online CPD activities, educators can maximize opportunities for learning transfer. In this article, we highlight four educational theories/frameworks that provide useful insight to tackle these interrelated factors in online CPD: Self-Determination Theory considers the intrinsic and extrinsic motivation of participants, which can be encouraged through flexibility, customization, and choices available in online formats. Practical Inquiry Model encourages intentionally planning and embedding opportunities for reflection and dialogue in online activities to enhance knowledge application. Virtual Communities of Practice can be used to transcend spatial and temporal boundaries, promoting interactions and relationships where participants learn from peers. Finally, Professional Learning Networks can be fostered through developing interpersonal connections and sharing resources for informal and flexible learning. Online CPD is likely to increase in the future, and educators should consider elements of these educational theories/frameworks in the design and delivery of CPD to support participants' application of newly acquired knowledge. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Although many critical care units promote the principle of ""patient-centered care"" and family member involvement, there can be a significant gap between knowledge about these processes and their translation into practice. This article is based on an implementation trial of a patient and family involvement knowledge-based tool that involves an educational component for frontline health care workers. By combining ethnographic observation, semistructured interviews, focus groups, and document analysis, we were able to not only examine health care provider views on family involvement but also explore the areas of tension that arose in practice because the introduction of the family involvement tool exposed local factors that shaped the conditions of possibility of family involvement. In particular, unspoken preferences, assumptions, and concerns about family involvement were brought to the fore because this intervention disrupted well-entrenched power dynamics related to family involvement and professional boundaries. Through this ethnographic research, we found that the concept of patient-centered care is not uncontroversial among health care providers and that the form of its practice was largely up for individual interpretation. Interventions and policies that aim to promote patient-centered and familycentered care would benefit from addressing the ways in which these ideas affect the work of different health care professionals and incorporating nursing concerns around family involvement. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The Pediatric Pain Practice Registered Nurses (PRN) Curriculum is the first free, open access, downloadable, interprofessional pain continuing education (IPPCE) curriculum developed to empower health care professionals to translate evidence-based pain care into clinical practice. To evaluate the curriculum and its experiential flipped-learning strategies, we used a mixed methods approach.Methods:Interprofessional pediatric teams from eight health care systems evaluated the curriculum after attending Pediatric Pain PRN Courses in the Fall of 2017 (N = 90). Qualitative methods were used to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and utility of the curriculum and IPPCE strategies. Pain knowledge and attitudes were measured pre-IPPCE/post-IPPCE with the Pediatric Healthcare Provider's Knowledge & Attitude Survey Regarding Pain (PHPKAS). Web analytics were used to describe dissemination for the first year after the curriculum's webpage launch.Results:Learners rated their achievement of course objectives as moderate-great. PHPKAS scores significantly increased (P <.0005); but significant differences in physician and nurse PHPKAS question responses pre-IPPCE/post-IPPCE were found. Within 2 years of the IPPCE, three health care systems were certified as Childkind Hospitals, five Pediatric Pain PRN Programs were established, and various practice changes and improved patient outcomes, such as decreased hospital lengths of stay and emergency department returns for pain, were realized. Curriculum dissemination was global.Discussion:Results support the acceptability, effectiveness, feasibility, utility, and global dissemination of the curriculum and IPPCE strategies. More rigorous patient outcome data are needed; however, this study demonstrated the benefit of a free, open-access, downloadable, interprofessional health care provider continuing education curriculum. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

However, the evolving science of COVID-19, the need for quick action, and the disruption of conventional knowledge networks pose challenges to existing CPD practices. To meet these emergent and rapidly evolving needs, what is required is an approach to CPD that draws insights from the domain of knowledge mobilization (KMb).Methods:This short report describes a research protocol for exploring rapid KMb responses to COVID-19 at one Canadian academic teaching hospital. The proposed research will proceed as a case study using a mixed methods design collecting quantitative (surveys and Web site use metrics) and qualitative data (interviews) from individuals involved in developing, using, and supporting the KMb resources. Analysis will proceed in two phases: Descriptive analysis of data to share insights and integrative analysis of data to build theory.Results:Results from this study will inform the immediate KMb and CPD contribution to the COVID-19 response.Discussion:Findings from this study will also make a broader contribution to the field of CPD, theoretically informing intersections between KMb and CPD and therefore contributing to an integrated science of CPD. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The goal of this scoping review is to address these questions.Methods:We completed a literature review using a comprehensive search in SCOPUS and PubMed (1998-2019), a direct solicitation for unpublished programs, and hand-searched key references, while targeting mentor programs in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada. After three rounds of screening, team members independently reviewed and extracted assigned articles for 40 design data items into a comprehensive database.Results:Fifty-eight distinct mentoring programs were represented in the data set. The team members clarified specific mentor roles to assist the analysis. The analysis identified mentoring program characteristics that were properly implemented, including identifying program goals, specifying the target learners, and performing a needs assessment. The analysis also identified areas for improvement, including consistent use of models/frameworks for program design, implementation of mentor preparation, consistent reporting of objective outcomes and career satisfaction outcomes, engagement of program evaluation methods, increasing frequency of reports as programs as they mature, addressing the needs of specific faculty groups (eg, women and minority faculty), and providing analyses of program cost-effectiveness in relation to resource allocation (return on investment).Conclusion:The review found that several mentor program design, implementation, outcome, and evaluation components are poorly aligned with recommendations, and content for URM and women faculty members is underrepresented. The review should provide academic leadership information to improve these discrepancies. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Siscare included regular patient-pharmacist motivational-based interviews; medication adherence, patient-reported, and clinical outcomes monitoring; and physician-pharmacist interactions.Method:This investigation was a prospective, multicenter, observational, mixed-methods cohort study. Interprofessionality was operationalized through four progressive levels of interrelationship practices between the health care professionals. The target number of patients per pharmacy was 10 among 20 pharmacies.Results:The project started with the recognition of Siscare by stakeholders, the creation of an interprofessional steering committee, and the adoption of Siscare by 41 pharmacies among 47 pharmacies in April 2016. Nineteen pharmacies presented Siscare at 43 meetings attended by 115 physicians. Twenty-seven pharmacies included 212 patients; however, no physician prescribed Siscare. Collaboration primarily occurred through the unidirectional transmission of information from the pharmacist to the physician (level 1: 70% of pharmacists transmitted interview reports to physicians), bidirectional exchange of information sometimes occurred (level 2: 42% received physician responses), and concerted measures of treatment objectives took place occasionally (level 3). Twenty-nine of 33 physicians surveyed were in favor of this collaboration.Discussion:Despite multiple implementation strategies, physician resistance and lack of motivation to participate exists, but Siscare was well received by pharmacists, patients, and physicians. Barriers to collaborative practice (financial and IT) need to be further explored. Interprofessional collaboration is a clear need to improve type 2 diabetes adherence and outcomes. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

We aim to describe if and how EPAs have a role after graduation. Are EPAs used for continuous entrustment decisions or when shifting work settings?Methods:In September 2020, all registered Dutch physician assistants (PAs) (n = 1441) were invited to participate in a voluntary, anonymous survey focusing on the use of EPAs after graduation. Survey items included questions regarding the use and usefulness of EPAs, views on continuous entrustment decisions, and how PAs document their competence.Results:A total of 421 PAs (response rate 29%) yielded information about the significance of EPAs after training. Among the respondents, 60% (n = 252) reported adding new competencies and skills after graduation. One-third (n = 120) of the respondents were trained in EPA-based programs.

Quantitative ratings and qualitative comments are collected from a sample of physician colleagues, co-workers (C), and patients (PT). These data are supplemented with self-ratings and given back to physicians in individualized reports. Each physician reviews the report with a trained feedback facilitator and creates one-To-Three action plans for QI. This study explores how the content of the four aforementioned multisource feedback program components supports the elicitation and translation of feedback into a QI plan for change.Methods:Data included survey items, rater comments, a portion of facilitator reports, and action plans components for 159 physicians. Word frequency queries were used to identify common words and explore relationships among data sources.Results:Overlap between high frequency words in surveys and rater comments was substantial. The language used to describe goals in physician action plans was highly related to respondent comments, but less so to survey items. High frequency words in facilitator reports related heavily to action plan content.Discussion:All components of the program relate to one another indicating that each plays a part in the process. Patterns of overlap suggest unique functions conducted by program components. This demonstration of coherence across components of this program is one piece of evidence that supports the program's validity. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Recent shifts have called for a move away from didactic CPD, which often fails to affect practice, toward workplace learning such as clinical coaching. Unfortunately, coaching programs are complex, and adoption does not guarantee effectiveness. To resolve this problem, thus ensuring resources are well spent, there is a critical need to understand what physicians try to achieve and how they engage. Therefore, we examined the types of change physicians pursue through clinical coaching and the impact of context on their desired changes.Methods:In the context of two clinical coaching programs for rural physicians, we applied a generic qualitative approach. Coachees (N = 15) participated in semistructured interviews. Analysis involved iterative cycles of initial, focused, and theoretical coding.Results:Coachees articulated desired practice changes along a spectrum, ranging from honing their current practice to making larger changes that involved new skills outside their current practice; changes also ranged from those focused on individual physicians to those focused on the practice system. Desired changes were affected by factors in the learning/practice environment, including those related to the individual coachee, coach, and learning/practice context.Discussion:These results suggest that the current focus on acquiring new knowledge through CPD may miss important learning that involves subtle shifts in practice as well as learning that focusses on systems change. Moreover, an appreciation of the contextual nature of CPD can ensure that contextual affordances are leveraged and barriers are acknowledged. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This problem occurs because the traditional curriculum vitae (CV) format which is most often used tends to focus on peer-reviewed accomplishments easily presented in lists, such as grants and publications. In some institutions, an educator portfolio is required in place of or in addition to the CV. However, creating or reviewing such a narrative-oriented document takes large amounts of time-time that most faculty or reviewers do not have. Having to use an educator portfolio also calls out the educator as different from the traditional research faculty member. To address this problem, we propose the solution of an Enhanced CV. The Enhanced CV includes much of what is presented in an educator portfolio but in a format closer to the traditional CV. Unlike a traditional CV, the Enhanced CV includes categories inclusive of educational contributions (eg, teaching, mentoring, and course leadership) and includes brief descriptions and/or impact statements to clarify the significance of the listed accomplishments. The Enhanced CV has been adopted at two very different institutions, where evidence is accumulating regarding the viability of the Enhanced CV as a solution to educators' problem of presenting their accomplishments for promotions. The lessons learned from these institutions illustrate how the Enhanced CV can increase the ability of educators to present their accomplishments and advance in rank in their academic careers. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This overview of existing systematic reviews aims to evaluate the impact of blended learning on educational outcomes in health care professional education, identify gaps in the current evidence, and direction for future reviews.Methods:Five databases were searched (January 1, 2000 to January 14, 2021) for systematic reviews of blended versus nonblended learning approaches for health care education. ""Flipped classroom"", unpublished studies, abstracts, and study protocols were excluded. The extracted data included details of included reviews, description of populations, and outcomes according to Kirkpatrick levels. A narrative review is presented, along with an overarching meta-analysis, which evaluates a synthesized estimate of the effect of blended learning based on standardized mean differences.Results:Eleven systematic reviews were included, comprising of 160 primary studies (including 117 randomized controlled trials) from 56 countries with over 18,000 participants. The overall level of evidence was very low quality. An overarching meta-analysis of 93 studies addressing knowledge acquisition favored blended over nonblended learning methods (standardized mean difference 0.768 [95% confidence interval 0.594-0.941]; P <.001). None of the reviews identified an adverse effect on other educational outcomes.Discussion:Blended learning may be superior to traditional teaching approaches in improving knowledge acquisition. We recommend further research to describe the relative benefits of blended learning in each individual context and identify which elements of instructional design are beneficial for each outcome. Finally, we recommend the use of clear and consistent terminology in reported studies. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Although train-The-Trainer (T3) is not a new approach, there has been considerable interest in using it to develop and sustain capacity, particularly in low-and middle-income countries. This systematic review aimed to better understand the factors to achieve and sustain change across multiple countries and levels through T3 approaches.Methods:A literature search was conducted of six scholarly, peer-reviewed, and gray literature databases. Data were extracted for the study method, design, characteristics, and implicit or explicit factors related to maximizing the likelihood of achieving and sustaining change. An existing conceptual framework for T3 interventions in global health guided the thematic analysis. The framework consisted of five factors pertinent to capacity building T3 initiatives: Talent, Resources, Alignment, Implementation, and Nurture and Development.Results:Twenty-Two studies met the inclusion criteria. The T3 training spanned all geographical regions, but interventions were most prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa (46%). Nearly all studies (68%) quantitatively examined change at the individual level (95%), but some studies also explored change at the organizational (77%) and institutional (23%) levels. Implementation and Nurture/Development were the two most salient factors in achieving and sustaining change. The greatest hindrances involved Resources and Context, an additional theme that the data identified.Discussion:The findings and recommendations from this first systematic review exploring antecedents influencing change through health-related T3 interventions can inform training and capacity-building investments, improve existing T3 initiatives, and steer planning for future approaches. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

However, faculty are not adequately trained to effectively teach these topics. The aim is to assess the effectiveness of a faculty-level workshop to teach health inequity.Methods:An interactive workshop was designed by an interprofessional faculty from a major urban teaching hospital, addressing SDOH, implicit bias, an ""Enhanced Social History,"" and the benefits of interprofessional care. Before and after completion, workshop participants completed surveys regarding comfort in teaching these concepts. Survey results were analyzed to assess benefits of the intervention.Results:Sixty-four percent of participants completed preworkshop and postworkshop surveys. Participants reported increased contemplation and improved comfort in teaching SDOH, barriers to medical care, and implicit bias.Conclusion:Faculty comfort in teaching health inequity increased after this workshop. This may help bridge the gap between the expectation of clinical faculty to evaluate trainee practice of patient-centered, culturally competent care, and faculty possession of and confidence in health inequity teaching skills in clinical settings. Future research should focus on learner- and patient-based outcomes, including teaching time and impact on delivery of care. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The model is grounded in quality improvement methodology and encourages bidirectional rather than top-down feedback. Learners identified specifically what went well with each module session (Plus) and how to improve for the next time (Delta). After each session, narrative responses were reviewed, aggregated into meaningful categories, and implemented when possible. Implemented improvements focused on increasing session interactivity and enhancing communication. Learners pointed to the uniqueness of the model and applauded efforts to embed them in the cocreation process. Asking learners to debrief their experience-especially during a module which is iteratively redesigned week-by-week-can offer a realistic view of what is working and what needs further refinement. As we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid, continuous educational quality improvement deserves renewed emphasis. Implementing the Plus/Delta debriefing model into longitudinal online teaching sessions is a translatable, easily replicable, and free method of receiving immediate and valuable learner feedback. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This study explores systemic influences of physician use of data for performance improvement in continuing professional development (CPD) by analyzing and interpreting data sources from organizational and institutional documents. Methods: The document analysis is the third phase of a mixed-methods explanatory sequential study examining cultural factors that influence data-informed learning. A gray literature search was conducted for organizations both in Canada and the United States. The analysis contains nonparticipant observations from professional learning bodies and medical specialty organizations with established roles within the CPD community known to lead and influence change in CPD. Results: Sixty-two documents were collected from 20 Canadian and American organizations. The content analysis identified the following: (1) a need to advocate for data-informed self-assessment and team-based learning strategies; (2) privacy and confidentiality concerns intersect at the point of patient data collection and physician-generated outcomes and need to be acknowledged; (3) a nuanced data strategy approach for each medical specialty is needed.

A curricular gap exists between promoting an understanding of SDH and teaching HCPs how to recognize and increase empathy to manage them. The project aim was to develop two virtual reality simulations (VRSs) as innovative methods to teach HCPs to identify and manage SDH. A secondary aim was to decrease unconscious bias and increase empathy by experiencing SDH from their patients' perspective.Methods:Scripts for two VRSs were created by two HCP educators and clinicians. Scripts were evaluated by experts using an index of content validity (CVI). An advisory panel critiqued the scripts for appropriateness for VRSs, adequacy of evidence-based practice, and use of VRS equipment and software. The panel participated in a focus group and completed a final evaluation. The VRSs then were pilot tested with five HCPs who assessed content and utility and participated in interviews. This led to iterative improvements. Qualitative data were analyzed using a content analysis approach.Results:The VRS scripts demonstrated adequate content-related validity evidence with CVI scores of 0.81 and 0.75. The expert panel found the VRS easy to use, useful as an educational tool, while promoting empathy for patients. Overall, participants were satisfied with using the VRS as an educational experience.Discussion:Through VRS technology, this project addresses a curricular gap in HCP training on SDH. VRS can be a useful tool to increase HCPs' understanding of SDH and, potentially, their empathy for patients. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

However, research in this area is limited. This article attempts to close the gap in literature with the results of a program evaluation of our interprofessional teaching academy through the lens of social capital and organizational culture.Methods:A program evaluation using a cross-sectional survey was conducted with all members of the Baystate Education Research and Scholarship of Teaching (BERST) Academy. The survey drew on a conceptual framework from previous literature on social capital, communities of practice, and faculty development evaluation. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and analysis of variance.Results:Overall survey response rate was 54%. More than 90% of respondents have applied the skills learned through BERST Academy into their practice. Social capital was defined with five items (Cronbach alpha = 0.87), and we found no significant difference between profession and social capital, suggesting that perceptions of social capital did not significantly differ by membership in a specific profession.Discussion:Our results showed that BERST Academy members were able to cultivate social capital through high-quality connections. An academy can serve as a unique culture within an institution to foster collaborative relationships that increase social capital, for members of different professions. In addition, an academy can also provide members with a community that benefits them in the greater organizational culture. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (Project ECHO®) is an established hub-and-spoke tele-education model aimed at building capacity and expertise in primary care providers. Our qualitative study explored how learning experiences within an ECHO mental health care program supported provider learning and ability to solve complex clinical problems. Methods: We sampled ECHO sessions across a 34-week cycle and analyzed audio transcribed data. Two individuals coded participant interactions during 2-hour recorded sessions using an iterative, constant comparative methodology. Results: The authors identified four key mechanisms of learning in ECHO: (1) fostering participants' productive struggle with cases, (2) development of an integrated understanding, (3) collaborative reformulation of cases, and (4) generation of conceptual solutions based on a new understanding. Throughout the ECHO sessions, learning was observed to be multidirectional from both the hub-to-spoke and between spoke sites. Discussion: Despite the widespread implementation of Project ECHO and other virtual learning models, a paucity of research has focused on mechanisms of virtual learning within these models. Our study demonstrated a bidirectional exchange of knowledge between hub specialist teams and primary care provider spokes that aligned with the development of adaptive expertise through specific learning experiences in Project ECHO. Moreover, the ECHO structure may further support the development of adaptive expertise to better prepare participants to address patients' complex mental health needs.

However, the extent to which trainees effectively transfer knowledge, skills, and attitudes that they acquire through training has received little attention. This study aimed to identify factors influencing training transfer of infection control professionals receiving infectious disease training.Methods:This cross-sectional study selected infection control professionals who completed an infectious disease training program provided by Korea Human Resources Development Institute for Health and Welfare. A self-reported questionnaire was used to collect data on sociodemographic variables, trainee characteristics, training design, work environment, and training transfer. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS (version 26.0).Results:The mean age of the 139 participants was 41.45 years, and 77% were female participants. Regression analysis indicated that the following factors significantly influenced the training transfer of infection control professionals and thereby decrease morbidity and mortality: for trainee characteristics, transfer experience (β = 0.205, P = 0.012) and motivation to learn (β = 0.196, P =0.016); for training design, learning objectives (β = 0.269, P = 0.021), goals (β = 0.356, P =0.023), and methods (β = 0.365, P = 0.020); and for the work environment, supervisor support (β = 0.275, P =0.024) and colleague support (β = 0.474, P = 0.022).Conclusion:Future training programs for improving training transfer should focus more on strategies to improve the motivation for training transfer. Trainees should be guided on (1) how to apply training knowledge in specific clinical contexts to improve their performance and (2) potential methods to get support from their supervisors and colleagues during training. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Studies on the effects of postgraduate psychiatric education programs for PCPs on psychiatric knowledge are limited.Methods:A total of 251 PCPs completed a 1-year fellowship. Data from program development and evaluation were analyzed for 4 fellowship years (2016-2019). Fellows were surveyed at baseline, midpoint, and postfellowship about mental health stigma, perceived competency, attitudes about psychiatry, satisfaction with current psychiatric knowledge, confidence and comfort to treat psychiatric illnesses, and program satisfaction. Psychiatric knowledge was evaluated at baseline, midpoint, and postfellowship.Results:Large effects were noted on perceived competency/self-efficacy and confidence in the treatment of common psychiatric disorders encountered in primary care settings. Positive effects were observed on attitudes of mental health stigma, and even more robust effects were found with improvement in psychiatry clinical knowledge. Knowledge improved by 12% at postfellowship (P <.0001). Correlations of the degree of change in attitude with improved psychiatric literacy demonstrated significant relationships with reduction of stigma total score (r = -0.2133, P =.0043), increased willingness (r = 0.1941, P =.0096), and increased positive attitudes (r = 0.1894, P =.0111).Conclusion:Innovative initiatives to improve and expand psychiatric knowledge and clinical skills among those who provide the most behavioral health care (PCPs) can have marked impacts on attitudes toward mental health care delivery, stigma, and competency/self-efficacy. Future studies are necessary to consider the impact of this program on clinical practice pattern outcomes on a larger scale. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

To respond to the urgent need, an interprofessional team created a just-in-time (JIT) module to provide only what was needed, precisely when needed, and rapidly deployed training sessions to a large group of health professionals.Methods:In April and May 2020, health professionals from the hospital, ambulatory clinics, and public health attended training. Procedural comfort/knowledge and perception of the training were assessed with pre-survey and post-survey.Results:Comfort level in collecting a nasopharyngeal specimen among participating health professionals increased from 2.89 (n = 338) on the pre-survey to 4.51 (n = 300) on the postsurvey on a 5-point scale. Results revealed a significant difference (P <.01) between pre-post knowledge questions regarding the correct angle and depth of the swab to obtain an adequate sample from the nasopharynx.Discussion:This study demonstrates that a JIT intervention can improve knowledge and comfort regarding the nasopharyngeal swab procedure. In preparation for the prevention and mitigation of future viral outbreaks (ie, coronavirus and influenza), educators should consider creating JIT skills training for health care professionals who may be deployed to assist in mass testing efforts. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The goal of this investigation is to determine whether a multifaceted faculty development program helps a group of faculty members incorporate POCUS into their practice.Methods:This intervention had five parts: (1) online prework, (2) 2-day workshop, (3) follow-up hands-on sessions, (4) regular communication, and (5) equipment acquisition. This is a pretest/posttest, single group, observational study where the main outcome measure is the number of POCUS examinations documented and the number of providers who performed at least one examination. In addition, presurveys and postsurveys were administered to determine whether there was a change in confidence and self-reported use of POCUS.Results:The number of examinations completed and the number of providers completing examinations by month both seemed to increase over time between May 2017 and October 2018. Between August 2017 and October 2018, the number of examinations completed per month increased by a rate of approximately one examination per month (starting with one examination in May 2017) and the number of providers completing examinations increased by a rate of approximately 0.61 providers per month (staring with one provider in May 2017).Discussion:This study shows that an intervention that targets interested faculty can increase the use of POCUS in practice and residents' perceptions of teaching. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Facing economic, resource, and personal challenges, educators had to cancel or repurpose in-person learning, and design and deliver effective online education. This short report analyzes the effect of this pandemic on CME in the United States.Methods:Organizations accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education are required to submit detailed data about their educational programs annually. This report compares 2019 and 2020 data sets to evaluate pandemic-related changes in the availability, formats, and participation in CME.Results:After years of comparative stability, 2020 saw significant shifts in CME. Compared with 2019, the number of accredited organizations, activities, hours of instruction, and revenue declined in 2020. In contrast, engagement in CME by physicians and other health care professionals increased to the record levels. Virtual learning formats predominated. Almost half of accredited organizations delivered activities addressing pandemic-related topics, mostly in online formats.Discussion:Educators anticipate continuing to offer activities in online and hybrid formats. This transformation presents new challenges and opportunities for CME. It is important that institutional leaders appropriately resource CME staff and faculty to design and deliver education targeting ongoing pandemic-related issues such as vaccine hesitancy, medical misinformation, and clinician burnout. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

We describe the process of developing the checklist and training the observers. We calculated a percent agreement and Cohen's kappa to assess inter-rater reliability.Results:Raters had a high percent agreement ranging from 0.8 to 0.9 for each step of OMP. Cohen's kappa ranged from 0.49 to 0.77 for the five OMP steps. The highest kappa obtained was for getting a commitment ( = 0.77) step, whereas the lowest agreement was for correcting mistakes ( = 0.49).Conclusion:We showed a percent agreement ≥0.8 and moderate agreement based on Cohen's kappa with most steps of OMP on our checklist.

Meaningful evaluation of engaging with patients and families within QI may promote future collaboration. The aim of this study was to identify the experiential impact of patient engagement from the perspective of health professionals who were leading health care QI projects. Methods: Point-of-care health professionals who completed a fellowship capacity building program between 2014 and 2018 that provided an opportunity to learn about patient engagement concepts and to engage patients, families, and caregivers in their QI projects were invited to participate in the study. The Most Significant Change technique was used as a participatory approach to obtain qualitative evaluative data from semistructured interviews with health professional fellows. Significant change stories were curated from self-narratives grounded in the experiences of health professional fellows. Results: The stories demonstrated that gaining new knowledge on concepts related to patient engagement as part of a structured curriculum is effective in both supporting engagement in practice and cultivating the importance of patient engagement among health professionals. The early and ongoing involvement of patients was a key factor in shaping the project while fostering a patient-centered focus. Seeking out the patient voice throughout the QI project led to improvements in patient care experiences. Discussion: The findings of this study can inform programs seeking to promote patient engagement in health care QI. The positive changes that stem from aligning capacity building programs with patient-oriented priorities support the vision that patient engagement should be at the foundation of health care QI. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

It was designed to assist family medicine educators with an understanding of the core activities of educators: precepting, coaching, and teaching within or beyond clinical settings. Given that an examination of member awareness of FTA has not been previously undertaken, our primary objective was to conduct an evaluation on its utility and application.Methods:In partnership with College of Family Physicians of Canada Faculty Development Education Committee members, we used a practical participatory evaluation approach to conduct a two-phase mixed-methods evaluation of the FTA. We distributed an electronic survey in French and English languages to Canadian faculty development, program, and site directors in family medicine. We then conducted follow-up interviews with self-selected participants.Results:Of the target populations, 12/15 (80%) faculty development directors (FDDs), 12/18 (66.7%) program directors, and 34/174 (19.5%) site directors completed the electronic survey. Subsequently, 6 FDDs, 3 program directors, and 3 site directors completed an interview (n = 12). Findings indicate that awareness of the FTA was highest among FDDs. Facilitators who encourage teachers to use the FTA and barriers for low uptake were also identified.Discussion:This evaluation illuminated that varied levels of awareness of the FTA may contribute to the low uptake among education leaders. We also suggest future research to address possible barriers that hinder effective applications of the FTA in faculty development initiatives. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital, Madison, WI, United States","Midcareer women faculty face unique career challenges that may benefit from mentorship and sponsorship, yet such programs focused on the needs of this career phase are scarce in academic medicine. Many midcareer faculty require intentional and individual career planning to choose a path from the broad array of options in academic medicine. Ambiguous promotion criteria, increased workloads because of service or citizenship tasks, and a lack of sponsorship are among the barriers that inhibit midcareer faculty's growth into the high-visibility roles needed for career advancement. In addition, issues faced by women midcareer faculty members may be further exacerbated by barriers such as biases, a disproportionate share of family responsibilities, and inequities in recognition and sponsorship. These barriers contribute to slower career growth and higher attrition among women midcareer faculty and ultimately an underrepresentation of women among senior leadership in academic medicine. Here, we describe how a mentoring program involving individuals (eg, mentors, mentees, and sponsors) and departments/institutions (eg, deans and career development offices) can be used to support midcareer faculty. We also provide recommendations for building a mentoring program with complementary support from sponsors targeted toward the specific needs of women midcareer faculty. A robust midcareer mentoring program can support the career growth and engagement of individual faculty members and as a result improve the diversity of academic medicine's highest ranks. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

With new models on the horizon, CPD developers will require additional knowledge and training. Our objective was to learn how CPD leaders and developers came into their roles, if they are engaged in scholarship and the challenges and opportunities in pursuing scholarship.Methods:We conducted a mixed grounded theory study, inviting CPD leaders within our institution for interviews focused on career paths, CPD and scholarly activities, networks, and supports and challenges. We invited 405 program/conference directors from our institution to participate in a survey focused on similar themes. We used the framework of ontological choreography in our final analysis.Results:We conducted 13 interviews and had a survey response rate of 28.6% (n = 116). We identified three themes: (1) the pathway to becoming an expert in CPD planning and delivery is often unplanned, unclear, and uncredentialed; (2) CPD is undervalued as a field, with inadequate time and funding allocated; and (3) engagement with scholarship is variable while identifying resources to support scholarship is difficult.Discussion:Beyond the usual calls for CPD to be more appropriately recognized and valued, this article offers another way to explore why past visions of the future have not been fully realized; CPD means different things to different people; it is ontologically different even across a single network in a single faculty. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Faculty were offered four 1-hour or eight half-hour sessions each academic semester by eight trained volunteer coaches unaffiliated with the university. We had 67 faculty members participate across the academic year. They were asked to complete a brief impact survey at the end of each semester.Results:The coaches provided 378 sessions, totaling 281 hours of coaching. Survey results revealed that coaching was effective in helping faculty achieve their professional goals and empowered them for future professional success. Faculty were highly satisfied with the program.Discussion:There is early evidence that professional development coaching can help faculty reach their professional goals and add value to an institution. The program may be a helpful model for developing and implementing coaching programs on other campuses. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Subjects included 25 clinical physicians, nurse practitioners, and certified nurse midwives. The intervention involved three monthly self-facilitated groups for faculty. Groups were randomized to have no discussion guide, or to receive a one-page guide. Outcomes of burnout, engagement, and empowerment in work, and stress from uncertainty were assessed using validated metrics.Results:Rates of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization decreased significantly over the course of the 3-month study (56%-36%; P <.001; and 20%-15%; P =.006) and overall burnout decreased from 56% to 41% of faculty (P =.002). The percentage of faculty who felt engaged in their work increased from 80% to 96% (P =.03). No statistically significant differences in empowerment at work or in reaction to uncertainty were seen. The groups without a discussion guide had equivalent outcomes and benefits. Cost per participant was under $100.Discussion:A three-month, low-cost, self-facilitated series of dinner meetings for interprofessional clinical faculty decreased burnout and improved engagement, sense of connection to colleagues, and sense of departmental commitment to well-being. Structured discussion guides were not necessary to achieve benefit. This study broadens the possibilities for cost-effective opportunities to transform institutional culture and effectively enhance faculty well-being. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

We describe findings from a Nigeria-based workshop for early-career physician scientists to build mentoring and leadership capacity in HIV and noncommunicable disease research.Methods:Baseline surveys captured participant demographics, confidence in implementing mentoring competencies, and perceived importance of workshop training domains. The workshop included didactic presentations, small group activities, and interactive discussions. Daily surveys evaluated sessions, and postworkshop surveys solicited overall course impressions.Results:Of the 33 participants, most were male (n = 21, 63.6%) and from medicine, laboratory sciences, and surgical specialties. ""Building mentees' confidence"" and ""setting mentees' research goals"" were ranked as areas where participants most believed they needed training. Sessions were rated favorably across five areas. Greatest improvements in mean scores were for confidence in identifying personal temperament styles, describing mentoring and leadership theories/frameworks, and developing mentoring plans. Additional identified workshop strengths were content relevance, leadership case series, interactive nature, and collegial atmosphere. All respondents indicated learning something new/useful/helpful in each session. At 6-month postworkshop, most respondents (25 of 26, 96%) had replicated or plan to replicate parts of the workshop in their departments/institutions.Discussion:Effective mentoring training initiatives targeting future academic leaders have the potential to create skilled academicians who can impart mentoring skills and competencies to their mentees. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This study evaluated an intervention (IG) to enhance bedside teaching in three content areas: critical thinking (CT), high-value care (HVC), and health care equity (HCE).Methods:The Communities of Practice model and Theoretical Domains Framework informed IG development. Three multidepartmental working groups (WGs) (CT, HVC, HCE) developed three 2-hour sessions delivered over three months. Evaluation addressed faculty satisfaction, knowledge acquisition, and behavior change. Data collection included surveys and observations of teaching during patient care. Primary analyses compared counts of post-IG teaching behaviors per hour across intervention group (IG), comparison group (CG), and WG groups. Statistical analyses of counts were modeled with generalized linear models using the Poisson distribution.Results:Eighty-seven faculty members participated (IG n = 30, CG n = 28, WG n = 29). Sixty-eight (IG n = 28, CG n = 23, WG n = 17) were observed, with a median of 3 observation sessions and 5.2 hours each. Postintervention comparison of teaching (average counts/hour) showed statistically significant differences across groups: CT CG = 4.1, IG = 4.8, WG = 8.2; HVC CG = 0.6, IG = 0.9, WG = 1.6; and HCE CG = 0.2, IG = 0.4, WG = 1.4 (P <.001).Discussion:A faculty development intervention focused on teaching in the context of providing clinical care resulted in more frequent teaching of CT, HVC, and HCE in the intervention group compared with controls. WG faculty demonstrated highest teaching counts and provide benchmarks to assess future interventions. With the creation of durable teaching materials and a cadre of trained faculty, this project sets a foundation for infusing substantive content into clinical teaching. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This study aimed to create a holistic picture of burnout drivers in academic medical faculty within a single department of a large, research university to better inform organization-sponsored interventions.Methods:The author used interpretive phenomenological analysis and the Job Demands-Resources model in this qualitative study. Full-time academic medical faculty completed two semistructured interviews approximately 6 months apart. Transcripts were coded using deductive and inductive coding.Results:Twenty-two faculty members participated in both interviews. Factors affecting burnout depended on individual and unit-level context, but interpersonal factors such as relationships with colleagues and interaction with learners created meaning for faculty or drove intention to leave the university. All participants reported personal coping mechanisms, and none participated in organization-sponsored, individual-level interventions.Discussion:In striving for meaningful burnout interventions, organizations should promote interpersonal factors (relationships with colleagues and meaningful interaction with learners) and provide protected time for faculty for their own personal coping. Research has suggested moving toward a universal burnout driver and intervention plan, but these data point toward the need for unit-specific study and interventions. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The authors analyzed identified frameworks based on thematic focus, scope of targeted faculty, and design structure.Methods:A scoping review was used to identify health professions education literature between 2005 and 2020. Frameworks were characterized according to the scope of the faculty targeted and design structure, and then, domains were grouped into topical categories for analysis.Results:Twenty-three articles met the criteria for data extraction, of which only one (4.3%) described the explicit use of a learning theory and three (13%) included an explicit definition of FD. One (4.3%) used a recognized framework, whereas 12 (52.2%) developed a novel framework based on an existing outline. Ten (43.5%) described de novo framework development. Only three (13.0%) used entrustable professional activities or similar constructs. Five (21.7%) programs targeted multiple health professions, 11 (47.8%) targeted a single health profession, and seven (30.5%) targeted a specific specialty within a health profession. Only two frameworks included a developmental component.Discussion:Few authors describe an explicit definition, learning theory, or use a pre-established framework when framing their FD programs. The use of entrustable professional activities to structurally link competencies to work practices is also uncommon, as well as the use of developmental structures designed to support progressive FD over time. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The sickness absence rate was 0.63% one year before and 0.75% one year after the intervention with no statistical significance. The mean number of sickness absence days did not significantly change. Causes for sickness absence spells significantly increased for diarrhea and back pain but decreased for upper respiratory infections with no statistical significance.Discussion:Implementation of a multifaceted intervention to train PCPs on the process of sickness certification did not affect the sickness absence rate. Further research is needed to assess the knowledge and understanding of physicians' sickness certification process and the underlying factors that govern it to better develop tailored and effective interventions. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

We compared sources and levels of stress, distress, and approaches to coping between nurses and physicians, and examined whether coping strategies helped mitigate the negative impact of stress and intentions to quit.Methods:Using a cross-sectional study design, burnout was measured with the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Psychological distress was measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. A self-reported survey was used to evaluate stressors, impact on perceived performance, and intentions to quit. The data were analyzed using t-tests and linear regression models.Results:Responses of 119 HCPs were analyzed. Findings suggest that (1) compared to physicians, nurses experienced a higher level of distress and burnout, and used more maladaptive coping strategies. (2) Both nurses and physicians experienced more distress and burnout during COVID-19 than before. (3) Adaptive coping strategies moderated the negative impact of stress on work performance (4) Adaptive coping strategies moderated the negative effect of stress on burnout, which in turn reduced intentions to quit. Stress negatively impacted work performance and burnout only for those with low, but not high, levels of adaptive coping strategies.Discussion:The current findings of HCPs' challenges, risks, and protective factors provide valuable information (1) on COVID-19's impact on HCPs, (2) to guide the distribution of institutional supportive efforts and recommend adaptive coping strategies, and (3) to inform medical education, such as resilience training, focusing on adaptive coping approaches. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The convenience sampling method was used to distribute the questionnaire online to 408 physicians across the nation in January 2021. Exploratory factor analysis was used to verify the research scale, and the Cronbach's Alpha test was used to confirm its reliability. During the data analysis, descriptive and inferential statistical tests were used.Results:It was observed that the physicians were willing to give COVID-19 patients the antivirals but hesitant to provide and suggest supportive care. The training status for COVID-19 treatment was varied. Female physicians prescribed more antiviral drugs than male physicians, received more training, and scored higher across the scale than male physicians (p = 0.001). The treatment approaches of physicians varied according to their specializations (p = 0.002) all over the scale.Conclusion:The publication of current Ministry of Health guidelines on a variety of themes related to COVID-19 treatment, as seen in Turkey, is both beneficial and important. However, because all physicians, regardless of specialty, are affected by current and will be in the future pandemics, it is necessary to design and maintain a continuous training program on pandemics and their management for all physicians. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Despite the potential benefits of data-driven learning, our understanding of how physicians engage in data-informed learning activities, particularly for CPD, remains unclear and warrants further study. The purpose of this study was to explore how physicians perceive cultural factors (individual, organizational, and systemic) that influence the use of clinical data to inform lifelong learning and self-initiated CPD activities.Methods:This qualitative study is part of an explanatory sequential mixed-methods study examining data-informed learning. Participants were psychiatrists and general surgeons from Canada and the United States. Recruitment occurred between April 2019 and November 2019, and the authors conducted semistructured telephone interviews between May 2019 and November 2019. The authors performed thematic analysis using an iterative, inductive method of constant comparative analysis.Results:The authors interviewed 28 physicians: 17 psychiatrists (61%) and 11 general surgeons (39%). Three major themes emerged from the continuous, iterative analysis of interview transcripts: (1) a strong relationship between data and trust, (2) a team-based approach to data-informed learning for practice improvement, and (3) a need for organizational support and advocacy to put data into practice.Conclusion:Building trust, taking a team-based approach, and engaging multiple stakeholders, such as data specialists and organizational leadership, may significantly improve the use of data-informed learning.

In this article, we suggest that coaching should be considered both a continuing professional development intervention as well as an integral part of a balanced and proactive solution to physician distress and burnout. Unlike other interventions, coaching is intended to help individuals gain clarity in their life, rather than to treat a mental health condition or to provide advice, support, guidance, or knowledge/skills. Certified coaches are trained to help individuals discover solutions to complex problems and facilitate decision-making about what is needed to build and maintain capacity and take action. Across many sectors, coaching has been shown to enhance performance and reduce vulnerability to distress and burnout, but it has yet to be systematically implemented in medicine. By empowering physicians to discover and implement solutions to challenges, regain control over their lives, and act according to their own values, coaching can position physicians to become leaders and advocates for system-level change, while simultaneously prioritizing their own well-being. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

When deficiencies in competence are identified, practitioners may undergo remediation. However, there is limited evidence regarding the effectiveness of remediation programs. The purpose of this review is to examine the purpose, format, and outcomes of remediation programs for regulated health care practitioners.Methods:All six stages of the scoping review process as recommended by Levac et al were undertaken. A search was conducted within MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, ERIC, gray literature databases, and websites of Canadian provincial regulatory bodies. Emails were sent to Registrars of Canadian regulatory bodies to supplement data gathered from their websites.Results:A total of 14 programs were identified, primarily for physicians (n = 8). Reasons for remediation varied widely, with some programs identifying multiple reasons for referral such as deficiencies in recordkeeping (n = 7) and clinical skills (n = 6). Most programs (n = 9) were individualized to address specific deficiencies in competence. The process of remediation followed three stages: (1) assessment, (2) active remediation, and (3) reassessment. Most programs (n = 12) reported that remediation was effective in improving competence.Conclusions:Regulatory bodies should consider implementing individualized remediation programs to ensure that clinicians' deficiencies in competence are addressed effectively. Further research is indicated, using reliable and valid outcome measures to assess competence immediately after remediation programs and beyond. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Mixing related but different areas of study forces the brain to reconcile the relationship between the areas while understanding each area well. By doing so, interleaving increases the likelihood of mastery and memory. Research from cognitive psychology and neuroscience provides the rationale for interleaving, and examples of its implementation in health profession education have begun to appear in the literature. If utilized appropriately, some common CPD interventions can leverage interleaving.

This study was conducted at Qatar University Health Cluster (Colleges of Pharmacy, Medicine, and Health Sciences) with the primary objective of identifying the educational needs of preceptors to design and review an educational professional development program.Methods:This study adopted a mixed-methods approach and was conducted in three stages: (1) assessment of preceptor educational needs, (2) designing of the Practice Educators' Academy program, and (3) revision and refinement of the designed program. The needs' assessment was conducted at all the three colleges through a validated survey and focus groups comprising of preceptors, students, and clinical faculty members. The sample included 209 survey respondents and 11 focus group sessions.Results:The results yielded five key themes and a variety of individual preferences, which were used to design a five-module face-to-face two-day interactive workshop. For the revision of the designed program, the syllabus was shared purposively with selected scholars and experts in the area of health professions education, and their feedback was collected and critically examined. Furthermore, the refinement of the program was performed on the basis of this feedback, resulting in the revised and representative program being ready for piloting.Discussion:A preceptor development program on experiential teaching and learning skills was successfully designed and revised with the needs of the clinical preceptors at its core. Preceptors' skills development can advance health care outcomes by preparing competent health professional graduates. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Advanced Practice Providers (APPs) provide inpatient care in a wide-range of settings. Little is known about the educational needs of APPs at academic medical centers or the effect of educational interventions directed at inpatient APPs on clinical care. Our study looked at the effect of an educational intervention on antimicrobial prescribing by APPs for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and candiduria (ASC). We also conducted a needs assessment on the opportunities and barriers to continuing medical education.Methods:The educational intervention consisted of in-person interactive learning accompanied by an online video. Pre-intervention and postintervention surveys included an educational needs assessment and knowledge acquisition assessment. A retrospective chart review of adult inpatients admitted to the APP services with bacteriuria or candiduria during the 3 months pre-intervention and postintervention was performed.Results:Our needs assessment revealed several barriers to APP-focused education including no protected time for learning, and curricula predominantly directed at the Graduate Medical Education level. Engaged APPs had improved knowledge scores, but the proportion of treated ASB or ASC episodes did not differ between the pre-intervention and postintervention.Discussion:Although our educational intervention did not change prescribing patterns, the intervention increased knowledge around ASB and ASC. The potential hierarchical structure of interprofessional care teams may be a barrier to changing antimicrobial prescribing. Our study identified the possibility of a hidden curriculum at academic medical centers that does not prioritize APP educational needs. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This sole reliance on virtual methods to deliver synchronous teaching sessions in medical education was novel. We found little empirical research examining pediatric educators' experiences. Hence, the objective of our study was to describe and gain a deeper understanding of pediatric educators' perspectives, focusing on the research question, ""How is synchronous virtual teaching impacting and transforming teaching experiences of pediatricians during a pandemic?""Methods:A virtual ethnography was conducted guided by an online collaborative learning theory. This approach used both interviews and online field observations to obtain objective descriptions and subjective understandings of the participants' experiences while teaching virtually. Pediatric educators (clinical and academic faculty) from our institution were recruited using purposeful sampling and invited to participate in individual phone interviews and online teaching observations. Data were recorded and transcribed, and a thematic analysis was conducted.Results:Fifteen frontline pediatric teachers from our large Canadian research-intensive university were recruited. Four main themes, with subthemes, emerged: (1) the love/hate relationship with the virtual shift; (2) self-imposed pressure to increase virtual engagement; (3) looking back, moving forward; (4) accelerated adaptation and enhanced collaboration.Conclusion:Pediatricians adopted new delivery methods quickly and found many efficiencies and opportunities in this shift. Continued use of virtual teaching will lead to increased collaboration, enhanced student engagement strategies, and blending the advantages of virtual and face-to-face learning. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The authors describe how McMaster University’s Program for Faculty Development (MacPFD) responded to this disruption by engaging in a digital transformation. Methods: The digital transformation process of MacPFD was mapped to the conceptual framework of digital transformation: Vial’s building blocks of the framework. A new website was launched to host and disseminate the content. Subsequently, both the website and the content were promoted using social media tools. Content generation, Google Analytics, event registrations, and Zoom webinar attendance records were data sources for the results. Analysis of the data was based on the reach component of the RE-AIM framework. Results: Six-month data range results were reported as producer-centered and user-centered outcomes. The former consisted of 54 resources from diverse content authors, whereas the latter received 33,045 page views from 26,031 unique users from 89 countries. Live webinar events had 1484 registrants, with 312 (21%) being guests from external institutions. Before the coronavirus disease 2019 disruption, MacPFD was a local program to support its faculty. Discussion: The MacPFD’s digital transformation shows a clear transition to a new “glocal” approach: an expanded global reach while still tending to our local development needs of the home institution’s faculty members.

The study goal was to explore generic and chronic pain-specific factors that influenced uptake of a continuous education program for chronic pain, the Project Extension for Community Health Outcomes (ECHO) CHUM Douleur chronique.Methods:The study team conducted 20 semistructured virtual interviews among participants of the program. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and two analysts used a reflexive thematic analysis approach to generate study themes.Results:Five aspects facilitating engagement, continued participation, and uptake of the Project ECHO were identified: Rapid access to reliable information, appraising one's knowledge, cultivating meaningful relationships, breaking the silos of learning and practice, and exponential possibilities of treatment orchestrations for a complex condition with no cure. Although participants' experiences of the program was positive overall, some obstacles to engagement and continued participation were identified: Heterogeneity of participants' profiles, feelings of powerlessness and discouragement in the face of complex incurable pain conditions, challenges in applying recommendations, medical hierarchy, and missed opportunity for advocacy.Discussion:Many disease-specific and contextual factors contributed to an increased motivation to participate in the ECHO program. Some elements, such as the complexity of diagnosis and treatment, and the multidisciplinary requirements to manage cases were identified as elements motivating one's participation in the program but also acting as a barrier to knowledge uptake. These must be understood in the broader systemic challenges of the current health care system and lack of resources to access allied health care. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

A 4-days residential ""Mindful Practice"" workshop for physicians and medical educators featuring contemplative practices, personal narratives, and appreciative dialogs about challenging experiences may hold promise in improving participants' well-being while also improving compassionate care, job satisfaction, work engagement, and teamwork.Methods:We collected baseline and 2-month follow-up data during four workshops conducted in 2018 to 2019 at conference centers in the United States and Europe. Primary outcomes were burnout, work-related distress, job satisfaction, work engagement, patient-centered compassionate care, and teamwork.Results:Eighty-five of 120 participants (71%) completed both surveys (mean age was 49.3 and 68.2% female). There were improvements (P <.01) in two of three burnout components (emotional exhaustion and depersonalization), work-related distress, job satisfaction, patient-centered compassionate care, work engagement and meaning, teamwork, well-being, positive emotion, mindfulness, somatic symptoms, and spirituality. Effect sizes (standardized mean difference of change) ranged from 0.25 to 0.61. With Bonferroni adjustments (P <.0031), teamwork, general well-being, and mindfulness became nonsignificant.Discussion:An intensive, multiday, mindfulness-based workshop for physicians had clinically significant positive effects on clinician well-being, quality of interpersonal care and work satisfaction, and meaning and engagement, all important indicators of improved health and sustainability of the health care workforce.

Primary care providers play a pivotal role in this effort, and a greater understanding of patient perspectives is needed to guide management and inform training. We used a validated consensus method, the nominal group technique (NGT), to identify patient-reported experience measures (PREM) related to CVD prevention deemed most important by both patients and providers. The NGT was used by using structured discussions between patients and providers to bring ideas about PREM CVD outcomes to a consensus. Four patient partners and four primary care providers were selected to participate in an NGT session. Each participant wrote down items/questions they believed important in CVD preventative care. After discussions, all items underwent anonymous ranking on a 5-point scale. Items were included/excluded based on 75% agreement a priori. The panel produced 10 items from a total of 26 after 2 rounds of ranking. The top two items were as follows: ""Is your treatment plan tailored to you"" and ""Was your physician good at giving information about your risk factors?"" These results are significantly different compared with existing quality measures because they highlight aspects of patient experience and therapeutic relationship. A questionnaire consisting of prioritized PREM items is valuable in quality improvement and continuous professional development (CPD). © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Only 54% of patients with hypertension have their condition adequately controlled. This study aimed to use academic detailing (AD) to improve practice team knowledge and confidence in blood pressure (BP) management, specifically in low-income, underresourced patient populations.Methods:AD was developed for five practices that care for high percentages of Medicaid-eligible patients. A needs assessment was administered to each site's practice champion to determine high-yield AD sessions for their team. Presession and postsession evaluations were completed by practice team members.Results:Fifty providers and eight staff member participants completed evaluations over nine sessions for two AD topics at four practice sites. Statistical significance was found for several items within sessions including accurately choosing cuff sizes and identifying barriers to home BP monitoring.Discussion:AD is a potentially financially efficient model to improve knowledge and confidence in hypertension care at the practice level. Tailoring session content to specific needs of a practice site, along with an identified practice champion, facilitated implementation of the program. This replicable model is one way to deliver evidence-based information to those who serve Medicaid-eligible patients. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The use of ""Dr"" or ""Doctor"" in a channel name is a way contributors establish expertise. The current study sought to understand the degree by which popular YouTube channels belonging to individuals who self-identify as doctors disclose their credentials and the nature of their disclosures.Methods:Two raters extracted descriptive characteristics from the most viewed public YouTube channel names meeting keyword search criteria of ""Doctor"" and ""Dr"". Channel-level disclosure was captured by examining a channel's ""About"" section. Video-level disclosure was captured by watching the first 2 minutes of the five most viewed videos from each channel.Results:Forty-eight channels (45.7%; 48/105) disclosed degree, 60 channels (57.1%; 60/105) disclosed specialty, and 26 channels (24.8%; 26/105) disclosed the level of training.

Current professional guidance from licensing boards on social media encourages transparency around expertise and credential sharing. In addition, it remains unclear what guidance other health care professionals receive about disclosure practices online. Future recommendations and training to health care professionals should include explicit language for transparent disclosure of credentials. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Methods: We describe a novel, learning program integrating systems-based practice curricula into competency-based interprofessional continuing education curriculum for health care professionals. The program incorporated experiential, team-based learning through the development of quality improvement projects. Presurveys and postsurveys assessed participant knowledge and skills. Mixed-level modeling analysis was used to examine the differences across all participants and each cohort. Results: Across all individuals in all cohorts, postsurvey scores significantly improved (pretest score 2.65) (P # .001). Controlling for cohort year, postsurvey scores increased between cohorts 1 and 2 (B = 0.52; P = .01) and between cohorts 2 and 3 (B = 0.24; P = .15), although increased were nonsignificant. Cohort participants also participated in health systems improvement projects and leveraged improved patient outcomes. Discussion: This project signifies a unique approach to delivering systems-based curricula to interprofessional learners in the health care system. Participants became more engaged in systems change, influenced network-level QI initiatives and improvement projects, and positively influenced patient-centered outcomes. Health systems can model this program by partnering with academic organizations to scale and disseminate best practices.

Although benefits of ELAM participation are well documented, the value of the IAPs has not been specifically evaluated. We explored the experience of ELAM Fellows and leaders from one institution to elucidate how institutional factors influence project implementation and outcomes. Methods: Fellows and deans participated in semistructured interviews. We analyzed the transcripts qualitatively to develop themes and describe factors that influenced IAP implementation and outcomes. We used the New World Kirkpatrick Model, an updated version of the widely used Kirkpatrick model of educational program evaluation, as a framework to elucidate how participants applied their leadership learning through project work, and to analyze early results of projects that indicated institutional impact. Results: Project work had bidirectional impact on the fellows in the program and on the institution itself. Project enablers included: focusing projects on institutional priorities, obtaining sustainable support, and navigating institutional complexity. Leading indicators of institutional outcomes included contributions to institutional leadership and culture, and mutual enhancement of the reputation of the fellow and of the institution. Discussion: By examining enablers and barriers for institutionally based projects conducted in a national leadership development program, we identified the drivers that facilitated application of leadership learning. Leading indicators of project outcomes reflected bidirectional impact on fellows and the institution, demonstrating outcomes at the highest levels of the New World Kirkpatrick Model.

However, little is known about the effectiveness of these programs. Therefore, we sought to assess the impact of TTT programs on learning and behavior of trainers for educating health and social professionals (trainees). Methods: Guided by the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care, we conducted a systematic review. We searched 12 databases until April 2018 and extracted data according to the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome model. Population was defined as trainers delivering training program to health care professionals, and the intervention consists in any organized activity provided by a trainer. There were no restrictive comparators, and outcomes were knowledge, attitude, skill, confidence, commitment, and behavior of trainers. We estimated the pooled effect size and its 95% confidence interval using a random-effect model. We performed a narrative synthesis when meta-analysis was not possible. Results: Of 11,202 potentially eligible references, we identified 16 unique studies. Studies were mostly controlled before-and-after studies and covered a unique training intervention. Targeted trainers were mostly nurses (n = 10) and physicians (n = 5). The most frequent measured outcome was knowledge (n = 12). TTT programs demonstrated significant effect on knowledge (Standardized mean deviation = 0.58; 95% CI = 0.11–1.06; I2 = 90%; P < .01; 10 studies). No studies measured trainers’ ability to deliver the training program. Discussion: TTT programs may improve the knowledge of trainers. However, the heterogeneity and small number of studies hamper our ability to draw conclusions that are more robust.

The benefits of continuing education (CE) workshops in the field of tinnitus have not been published. This study evaluated the outcomes of a workshop centered around a Sound Therapy and Aural Rehabilitation for Tinnitus (START) framework. Our hypotheses were that a CE workshop would (1) be useful, (2) improve clinician's knowledge and willingness to undertake tinnitus practice, and (3) result in learners using knowledge gained in their practice.Methods:Twenty-five participants attending a 3-day tinnitus workshop were invited to complete an evaluation immediately and 3 months after the workshop's completion. The workshop consisted of seminars and practical sessions. The pedagogical approaches employed were experiential (theory building, reflection, and testing) and community of practice (shared experiences).Results:Participants reported on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not useful-5 = excellent) a high level of satisfaction both immediately after the workshop (ratings of usefulness: mean, 4.8; SD, 0.4; willingness to practice: 4.6; SD. 0.6; ability to manage: 4.6; SD, 0.5; all ""excellent"" ratings) and 3 months later (ratings of usefulness: mean, 4.2; SD, 0.9, ""very useful;"" willingness to practice: 4.6; SD, 0.6, ""excellent;"" ability to manage: 4.1; SD. 0.5, ""very useful""). Open-ended questions indicated participants made changes in their practice that reflected material provided in the CE.Conclusion:The workshop was successful in improving knowledge and confidence of audiologists in undertaking tinnitus assessment and management, but the need for ongoing support and supervision was a common theme. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

We describe the psychological needs of HCPs during COVID-19 and the implementation of Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) Coping with COVID (ECHO-CWC) to help HCPs manage COVID-19 distress.Methods:We used an established rapid implementation approach to accelerate the development and delivery of ECHO-CWC to address the emerging needs of HCPs. Participants' needs were identified using a 10-question survey of participants' perceived risk of COVID-19 and a five-item self-efficacy measure. Implementation outcomes consisted of participant engagement and session satisfaction scores using a five-point Likert scale.Results:A total of 426 participants registered for ECHO-CWC. Needs assessment data (n = 129) showed that most participants reported feeling increased stress at work (84.5%), fear of infecting others (75.2%), and fear of falling ill (70.5%) from COVID-19, yet most participants accepted the risk associated with work during this time (59.7%). Participants were highly satisfied with the initial five sessions (mean = 4.26).Discussion:HCPs reported the greatest concern with fears of infection and infecting others during the acute phase of the pandemic. Using an iterative curriculum design approach and existing implementation frameworks, the ECHO tele-education model can be rapidly mobilized to address HCPs' mental health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

However, travel to in-person workshops can be time-consuming and expensive. Thus, we developed a free online course to provide training in IYCF to health professionals globally; the course received overwhelmingly high numbers of registrations. Our aim was to conduct a program evaluation to assess course satisfaction, learning, and application using surveys administered postcourse and 9 months later. Response rates were 99% (n = 835) and 55% (n = 312), respectively. Among those who only partially completed the course, reasons for noncompletion were assessed (response rate 29%, n = 72). Data within a 1-year period were analyzed. Respondents worked in multiple settings and organizations worldwide. Nearly all (99%) reported postcourse that they learned “a lot” or “some” from all topics, and over 70% applied “a lot” of or “some” information 9 months later. In open-ended questions, respondents reported improved knowledge, skills, and competence to conduct their work; they also desired more similar training courses. Many who did not complete the course reported “not enough time” as the main reason (74%), and most (94%) wanted to continue it. The positive response to the course suggests there is an unmet need for CPD for health professionals in LMICs. Our evaluation found that online training was feasible, acceptable, and increased professionals’ knowledge and application of IYCF concepts in nutrition programming. Increased use of online CPD offers the potential for global capacity-building in other health-related topics. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Motivational interviewing (MI) is effective for engaging ambivalent patients in behavior change. However, many clinicians report barriers to receiving MI training, including time, cost, and travel. This study examined the effect of a 2-day virtual MI training built around didactic and real-play learning activities. Methods: Thirty interprofessional clinicians from eight Veterans Affairs medical centers and their community-based outpatient clinics across 4 US states attended a 2-day virtual MI training. Participants completed a posttraining evaluation and a 3-month posttraining evaluation. Results: Participants reported that they learned new knowledge and skills, and they would be able to apply these to their practice (M > 4).They reported high satisfaction with the training and platform and found the technology easy to use (M > 4). In the 3-month posttraining survey, participants reported that they were using MI in their practice (M = 4.19) and that they would like additional support, such as additional reading (n = 8). Discussion: This study demonstrates the effect of a 2-day virtual MI training built around didactic and real-play learning activities. Virtual training particularly enhances training opportunities in rural settings. Our training removed travel and payment as barriers to participation.

Retrieval practice requires one to examine long-term memory to work with priority information again in working memory. Retrieval practice improves learning in two ways. It improves memory for the information itself (direct benefit), and retrieval practice provides feedback about what needs additional effort (indirect). Both benefits contribute significantly to durable learning. Research from cognitive psychology and neuroscience provides the rationale for retrieval practice, and examples of its implementation in health professions education are increasingly available in the literature.

Methods: The study utilized an anonymous online survey measure with both open-ended and Likert-scale questions. The measure examined general attitudes, perceived impact, and experiences of engagement with PCS. This study examines the scale items only. All 4350 doctors enrolled on a PCS were invited through email to complete the survey. One thousand four hundred eight doctors participated, indicating a response rate of 32%. Results: Descriptive and inferential statistics (analysis of variance and Kruskal–Wallis) were performed on the scale items using IBM SPSS statistics, with group comparisons examining differences in responses according to gender and current primary role. A majority (80%) of respondents had positive overall attitudes to PCS. Most participants reported that CPD positively impacts their practice across a wide range of areas, particularly patient care. Most participants reported positive experiences engaging with PCS, although a minority reported difficulties, including lack of time to participate in and record CPD activities, difficulties obtaining evidence of participation, and feeling that their CPD activities are not easily captured by the PCS system. Significant differences in responses according to role were found for overall attitudes (confidence interval = 95%, P < .00) and overall experiences of PCS (confidence interval = 95%, P < .00) with nonconsultant hospital doctors emerging as a particularly vulnerable group with less positive attitudes and experiences. Discussion: Across the board overall attitudes, perceived impact and experiences of PCS were positive, and indicate that doctors feel that PCS is a valuable and beneficial activity. However, a minority of respondents reported experiencing difficulties with engagement, and these areas of difficulty represent targets for future improvement. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

These declarations are required in some constituencies. The three-slide template and similar protocols exist to assure learners that the content that follows has been screened, is notionally bias free, and without financial or other influence that might negatively affect health provider behavior. We suggest that there is a potential problem with this type of process that typically focusses in on a narrow definition of conflict of interest. There is the possibility that it does little to confront the issue that bias is a much larger concept and that many forms of bias beyond financial conflict of interest can have devastating effects on patient care and the health of communities. In this article, we hope to open a dialogue around this issue by “making the familiar strange,” by asking education organizers and providers to question these standard disclosures. We argue that other forms of bias, arising from the perspectives of the presenter, can also potentially change provider behavior. Implicit biases, for example, affect relationships with patients and can lead to negative health outcomes. We propose that CPD reimagine the process of disclosure of conflicts of interest. We seek to expand reflection on, and disclosure of, perspectives and biases that could affect CPD learners as one dimension of harnessing the power of education to decrease structural inequities.

As the underlying rationale for engaging patients in continuing professional development (CPD) is commonly described as fostering care that is more patient-centered, we hoped to understand the discursive conditions for how educators and health professionals can (or cannot) learn with, from, and about patients. Methods: Using diabetes as a case, we conducted a Foucauldian discourse analysis of an archive of relevant policy documents, professional and educational texts, to explore different conceptualizations of practice and the implications for PCC. We also conducted in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of physicians to understand their experiences in providing and teaching PCC. We sought to understand: How has PCC been discursively constructed? Whose interests does advocating PCC serve? What are the implications for patient involvement in CPD? Results: We describe three discursive constructions of PCC, each extending the reach of biomedical power. PCC as a disease intervention emphasizes knowing and relating to patients to normalize laboratory test results. PCC as a form of confession promotes patients to come to their own realizations to become responsible for their own health, but through the lens and evaluation of physicians. PCC as a disciplinary technique makes visible the possibility of using a checklist to judge physician competency in providing PCC. Discussion: PCC may be constructed in ways that paradoxically reinforce rather than challenge conventional, provider-centric paradigms. Our results challenge educators to acknowledge the existence and effects of discourses when involving patients in the planning and delivery of CPD. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Experienced SEs are known to grow confident with their expanding experience, but evidence is scarce about how this affects their development as clinical professionals. The aim of this study was to explore how experienced SEs describe their role within the context of everyday health care.Methods:An explorative descriptive study including 14 semistructured interviews and 27 questionnaires was conducted with 41 experienced SEs. An inductive thematic analysis was used to identify and analyze patterns describing SEs' perceptions of the influence of their educational work on everyday health care.Results:The SEs' descriptions of their encounters during everyday clinical work, which were affected by the fact that they had experience of facilitating simulation training, were gathered into three main themes with three of their own subthemes: Education (educational needs, routines/guidelines, and being a resource), nontechnical skills (communication, feedback, and leadership/coworkership), and clinical proficiency (situational insight, role model, and confidence in clinical practice). The insights gained and actions taken as clinical professionals are all intended to be implemented with the ultimate aim of safe patient care.Discussion:All the aspects of the SEs' work are perceived to be successfully translated into clinical practice and can be summarized by the main themes of education, nontechnical skills, and clinical proficiency as delineated by this study. These themes are demonstrated at the individual, team, and organizational levels through increased competence and confidence. © 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This report describes the results of training to promote behavioral change by altering pharmacists' perceptions toward opioid misuse through the provision of content-related education.Methods:A free 3-hour opioid misuse and overdose prevention training program was developed and delivered to 43 community pharmacists. The training consisted of five modules addressing the disease of addiction, risks associated with opioids and accidental overdose, the role of naloxone, opioid dispensing and consultation pearls, and effective ways to communicate with patients about opioids. A paired analysis was performed from a 12-item survey delivered before and after the training program to assess changes in pharmacists' perception.Results:Five items showed a statistically significant (P <.05) change in perceptions after the training. Significant changes were reported for opioid addiction being outside the control of the affected person, the role of family history in prescription drug abuse, the value of counseling to support patients at risk of prescription opioid abuse, the value of screening tools, and the importance of viewing things from the patient's perspective. Correlation analysis identified that pharmacists' views on their role in the fight against the opioid epidemic and their agreement in the value to screen for opioid misuse were most closely related to the desire for behavioral change.Discussion:A training program influenced pharmacists' attitudes and perceptions about targeted behaviors and associated with the value of screening for opioid misuse or overdose risk and counseling patients about the benefits and risks of opioids. © 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The opioid epidemic has risen to the forefront of health priorities in our nation. The Opioid and Naloxone Education (ONE Rx) CE program provides pharmacists the opportunity to expand their abilities and impact in the opioid crisis.Methods:ONE Rx CE included risk assessment for opioid misuse/overdose, role of naloxone, disease of addiction, and communication strategies for patients and providers. Pharmacists who completed the CE screened patients and provided interventions over 12 months. CE participants were provided presurveys, postsurveys, and delayed postsurveys coordinated with the educational program. The Kirkpatrick Model was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the program by examining the four levels of assessment: reaction, commitment, behavior, and results.Results:The Kirkpatrick Model was used to evaluate the impact of the CE. Reaction: 97% of respondents recommended the ONE Rx program. Commitment: 77% of respondents indicated commitment to provide ONE Rx opioid risk screening and interventions to patients. Behavior: Twelve months after training, pharmacists registered to prescribe naloxone increased by 67% and the number of pharmacists reporting naloxone dispensing doubled from 23% to 46%. Outcomes: Pharmacist interventions included medication take back programs explained (88.4%), naloxone dispensing to high-risk patients (10.9%), and discussion of opioid use disorder with patients with risk factors (49%).Conclusion:By using the Kirkpatrick Model, the ONE Rx CE program demonstrated high-quality opioid and naloxone education to pharmacists. Survey results and opioid harm reduction interventions indicate the CE resulted in sustained pharmacy practice behavior change.

The peer-review process is crucial for journals to be able to fulfill this purpose. Although the peer-review determines whether scientific papers are accepted or rejected for publication, for many authors is a not well known process in its entirety. Many journals have focused on educating their audience about how and what is assessed during peer-review, nevertheless, the rate of manuscripts rejected because of easily-Avoidable causes related to this, remains high. In this paper, we describe the process that specialized journals use to assess original medical manuscripts and list the main causes of paper rejection.

A stakeholder group designed a set of knowledge translation (KT) interventions to increase the use of evidence-based practices across relevant health care and social service arenas. Efforts to decrease stigma was included as a best practice. Understanding the process and the contexts in which KT intervention activities occur can help increase their effectiveness. Toward that end, this study examined how stigma was addressed and how audiences responded to evidence-based messages.Methods:Data were collected over a seven-year period and included observations of KT activities (conferences, workshops, and community meetings), focus groups and interviews conducted with providers, and a review of publicly available documents, including KT intervention materials. Clarke's situational mapping was initially applied, and stigma emerged as a critical contextual element. Data were then analyzed to identify how stigma was addressed and how evidence-based messages were received.Results:Despite direct stigma-reduction messages, biases against maternal drug use and ambivalence toward evidence-based recommendations of harm reduction principles were found in audience responses. Findings also revealed tensions around the interpretation of knowledge and the appropriate implementation of best practices between ""experts"" and among practitioners.Discussion:Stigma and professional biases may serve as significant barriers to KT activities. Results suggest that even under the best of circumstances, evidence-based practices for highly stigmatized and controversial issues are difficult to disseminate and may require unique approaches. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Eligible studies described programs with leadership development intent for faculty in AHCs. Information was extracted using a structured data form and process.Results:Six hundred ninety citations were screened; 25 publications describing 22 unique programs were eligible. The majority (73%) were institutionally based; mean class size was 18.5 (SD ± 10.2, range 4.5-48); and mean in-person time commitment was 110 hours (SD ± 101.2, range 16-416), commonly occurring in regular intervals over months to years (n = 10, 45%). Six programs provided per participant costs (mean $7,400, range $1000-$21,000). Didactic teaching was the primary instructional method (99.5%); a majority (68%) included project work. Fourteen thematic content areas were derived from 264 abstracted topics. The majority or near majority incorporated content regarding leadership skills, organizational strategy and alignment, management, self-assessment, and finance/budget.Discussion:Institutions and faculty invest significantly in leadership development programs, addressing perceived needs and with perceived benefit for both. The prevalence of common curricular content indicates that AHCs deem important faculty development in leadership, business, and self-assessment skills. © 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Currently, this study compares providers receiving and not receiving AD in terms of inclusion of AD educational topics and shared decision-making elements in documentation.Methods:Physicians reviewed themes discussed with providers during AD and evaluated charts for evidence of shared decision-making. Frequencies of documentation of individual items for providers receiving AD versus non-AD providers were compared. To understand baseline documentation practices of AD providers, encounters of AD providers before their AD participation were randomly selected.Results:There were 113 eligible encounters in the four months after AD - 36 from AD providers and 77 from non-AD providers. Thirty-five encounters were identified from AD providers before participating in the intervention. Providers infrequently documented many reviewed items (% documenting): anticoagulation mentioned (44%), multiple options for anticoagulation (5%), CHA2DS2-VASc score (11%), bleeding risk factors (2%). Compared with non-AD providers, AD providers had statistically significant higher percentages for the following items: mention of anticoagulation (64% versus 35%), stroke risk (11% versus 0%), anticoagulation benefits (8% versus 0%), and patient involvement (17% versus 0%). There was no improvement, however, for AD providers compared with baseline documentation percentages.Discussion:Providers infrequently documented important items in anticoagulation management and shared decision-making. AD participation did not improve documentation. Improving adoption of AD educational items may require more prolonged interaction with providers. Improving shared decision-making may require an intervention more focused on it and its documentation. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

We surveyed HIV providers to assess perceived preparedness in caring for aging PLWH and knowledge gaps. Methods: We surveyed HIV providers from October to December 2018 on preparedness (1 = strongly unprepared to 5 = strongly prepared), topics of interest, and participant characteristics including the number of years after training, number of PLWH aged $50 years seen/month, degree types (MD/DO versus others), and practice setting (academic versus nonacademic). We grouped “strongly prepared/somewhat prepared” responses as “prepared” and “neutral/somewhat unprepared/strongly unprepared” as “unprepared.” The effects of participant characteristics on preparedness were determined using chi-square test. Results: Of 226 participants, 54% were physicians, 27% were NP/PA, 19% were PharmD, and 40% practiced in academic settings. The average preparedness score was 3.37 out of 5.0. Approximately half of participants (56%) were classified as “prepared.” The mode number of years in practice was “10 to <20” (22%); mode number of PLWH aged $50 years seen/month was “1 to 25” (50%). HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (73%) and geriatric syndrome screening (63%) were the most chosen areas of interest. Unprepared participants were interested in topics of cardiovascular disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.38; P = .002) and palliative care (OR, 1.92; P = .02). Having >20 years after training increased preparedness (“20 to <30” years versus “none”: OR, 3.37; P = .03; “$30 years” versus “none”: OR, 3.66; P = .04). Conclusion: Approximately half of the surveyed HIV providers felt prepared to care for aging PLWH. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, geriatric syndrome screening, cardiovascular diseases, and palliative care were areas of interest. Having >20 years after training increases preparedness.

In this era of competency-based medical education, feedback is one of the core components of this new model. A better understanding of the medical faculty's attitudes and experiences when providing feedback is essential. Currently, there are limited qualitative studies that have explored attitudes and experiences of faculty members when giving corrective feedback to medical trainees.Methods:To allow an in-depth exploration of this phenomenon, a hermeneutics phenomenology approach was used, by conducting semistructured interviews with 10 faculty members representing six disciplines and used thematic analysis to create data-driven codes and identify key themes through an iterative consensus-building process.Results:Four themes were identified by the authors: (1) Elements of effective feedback, (2) Faculty members' perception of giving corrective feedback, (3) Challenges as it relates to the assessment culture of the institution, and (4) Providing effective corrective feedback as a mutual process focused on relationship building between learners and preceptors.Discussion:By exploring faculty members' perceptions of providing perceived corrective feedback, we identified actionable recommendations based on the study participants' experiences, expectations, and challenges which could be addressed involving future faculty development with the focus on modifying concepts of feedback and institutional changes that will promote an attitudinal and a cultural shift. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Although information and communication technologies (ICTs) can strengthen continuous professional development (CPD) and learning at work, more research is needed on ICT for experiential and collegial learning.Methods:The study builds on prior qualitative research to identify issues and comprises a quantitative assessment of ICT usage for learning in health care. A survey was administered to Swedish physicians participating in a CPD program as part of specialist medical training. Conclusions focused specifically on learning dimensions are drawn from correlation analyses complemented with multiple regression.Results:The findings show that physicians' actual use of ICT is related to perceived performance, social influence, and organizational context. Social norm was the most important variable for measured general usage, whereas performance expectancy (perceived usefulness of ICT) was important for ICT usage for learning. The degree of individual digitalization affects performance and, in turn, actual use.Discussion:The study highlights the need to incorporate ICT effectively into CPD and clinical work. Besides formal training and support for specific systems, there is a need to understand the usefulness of digitalization integrated into practice. Moving beyond instrumentalist views of technology, the model in this study includes contextualized dimensions of ICT and learning in health care. Findings confirm that medical communities are influencers of use, which suggests that an emphasis on collegial expectations for digital collaboration will enhance practitioner adaptation.

Evidence linking CTC to actual practice change is limited. Methods: In an intervention that combined live CME with changes to the electronic health record to promote judicious antibiotic use for children with urinary tract infections (UTIs), we evaluated CTC and subsequent prescribing behavior in Kaiser Permanente Colorado, an integrated health care system. CTC was assessed immediately after the session using closed-ended questions about session learning objectives and open-ended questions to elicit specific practice changes. Perceived barriers to implementing recommended changes were also assessed. Results: Among 179 participants, 80 (45%) completed postsession evaluations and treated one or more child with a UTI in the subsequent 17 months (856 UTIs in total). In closed-ended responses about session learning objectives, 45 clinicians (56%) committed to changing practice for antibiotic choice and duration, whereas 37 (46%) committed to implementing new practice guidelines. When asked open-ended questions to identify specific practice changes, 32 (40%) committed to antibiotic choice change and 29 (36%) committed to treatment duration change. Participants who made specific CTC statements had greater improvement in antibiotic choice (relative rate ratio 1.56, 95% CI 1.16–2.09) and duration (relative rate ratio 1.59, 95% CI 1.05–2.41) than participants who did not make specific commitments. Few perceived barriers affected subsequent prescribing. Discussion: Commitments to changing specific clinical behaviors were associated with sustained changes in prescribing for children with UTIs. Linking self-evaluations with clinical data in integrated health care systems is an important tool for CME evaluators.

So, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the educational needs assessment of nurses for hemodynamic monitoring in ICUs. Methods: The present descriptive–analytical study was conducted to evaluate the educational needs assessment of ICU nurses in terms of the hemodynamic monitoring. The research sample included 100 ICU nurses selected from the hospitals affiliated to Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran. For data collection, researcher-made observational checklist and researcher-made questionnaire of clinical reasoning skills were used to assess the educational needs for hemodynamic monitoring. Results: The findings from the clinical practice checklists on hemodynamic monitoring revealed that nurses’ practice was moderate in all 10 cases of monitoring with a mean of 79.30% (SD = 15.32%). Moreover, the nurses included were given a 9-item questionnaire regarding clinical reasoning skills. Accordingly, the results of this questionnaire indicated that nurses’ clinical reasoning skills were at a poor level with a mean of 52.56% (SD = 8.71%). Discussion: The findings suggested that the development of continuing education programs in the area of clinical reasoning skills for hemodynamic monitoring should be more emphasized on. Also, nurses need to learn how to examine the patient carefully, find nursing diagnoses, set goals of care, and plan nursing interventions for their patients. They should also be able to assess how they affected the patient after performing the interventions. Furthermore, attention should be paid on improving practical skills for hemodynamic monitoring.

Accordingly, there is a lack of intentional development and support of medical education leaders despite such individuals having critical influence over key organizational functions. Unequivocally, educational leaders have complex and dynamic jobs that require clear delineation of roles, responsibilities, and resources available to successfully train the next generation of health professionals. Although there is guidance on how to longitudinally onboard medical education leaders, there is little information on how to effectively orient such leaders on the functional nature of their jobs. Baylor College of Medicine's medical school dean developed and delivered a 2-day orientation program to educational leaders to clarify roles, responsibilities, and resources. Postevaluation surveys aimed to identify key session content that would be frequently used by educational leaders to oversee key aspects of medical education. The purpose of this article is to outline the structure and content of an orientation program designed for medical education leaders, and share postevaluation data to identify which sessions were most used in practice. Other deans are encouraged to take ownership over the professional development of their educational leaders and delivering similar programming. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

To this end, the concepts of the doctor-patient relationship and doctor-patient communication are revisited to explore their therapeutic dimensions. The concept of TP is defined, and existing literature about the relationship between that concept, the therapeutic alliance, and mindfulness is reviewed, alongside an examination of related concepts that have developed within nursing and medicine. We conclude that TP emerges as a transtheoretical concept that can be integrated into our understanding of the doctor-patient encounter to improve both doctor-patient communication and the doctor-patient relationship. The way in which the biomedical model may limit a present medicine is discussed, and the means of integrating such a model of doctor-patient encounter into medical training and practice is analyzed. © 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This often forces pediatricians to engage in educational activities that are irrelevant to their practice. This is contrary to what constitutes effective CME. The goal was to develop pediatric content using adult learning theory that aligns with effective CME principles while simultaneously satisfying state licensure requirements. A targeted needs assessment of pediatric providers revealed that pediatric-specific CME activities satisfying the state's requirement for pain management and end-of-life issues were lacking. Webinars adhering to adult learning principles were created in consultation with content experts. Five hundred ninety-seven learners across 30 states successfully completed the webinars and received CME credit. To satisfy ongoing state licensing requirements, 44% of learners had completed similar activities in the past, but 72% of those learners participated in activities focused on adult medicine due to the lack of available pediatric modules. Until states and regulators allow for more flexibility in satisfying licensing requirements, it will be incumbent on those who create CME to develop educational activities that satisfy state requirements while aligning with the principles of effective CME. With strategic planning, this is possible and will hopefully empower physicians to engage in CME without resorting to ""checking a box."". © 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This study examined the self-perceived challenges with dementia care and learning needs among primary care clinicians and assessed whether these were associated with years of practice and perceived preparedness for dementia care.Methods:Participants were multi-disciplinary clinicians attending a 5-day team-based dementia education program and physicians attending a similar condensed continuing medical education workshop. Pre-education, they completed an online survey in which they rated (5-point scales): interest in learning about various dementia-related topics, perceived challenges with various dementia-related practice activities and preparedness for dementia care, provided additional dementia-related topics of interest, number of years in clinical practice, and discipline.Results:Thirteen hundred surveys were completed across both education programs. Mean ratings of preparedness for dementia care across all respondents reflected that they felt somewhat prepared for dementia care. Challenge ratings varied from low to very challenging and mean ratings reflected a high level of interest in learning more about all of the dementia-related topics; significant differences between disciplines in these ratings were identified. In most cases, perceived challenges and learning needs were not correlated with number of years in clinical practice, but in some cases lower ratings of preparedness for dementia care were associated with higher ratings of the challenges of dementia care.Discussion:Clinicians perceived that their formal education had not prepared them well for managing dementia and desired more knowledge in all topic areas, regardless of years in practice.

The aim of this work was to (1) qualitatively explore whether, how, and why an academic detailing intervention could improve evidence uptake and (2) identify perceived changes that occurred to inform outcomes appropriate for quantitative evaluation.Methods:A qualitative process evaluation was conducted involving semistructured interviews with nursing home staff. Interviews were analyzed inductively using the framework method.Results:A total of 29 interviews were conducted across 13 nursing homes. Standard processes to reduce falls are well-known but not fully implemented due to a range of mostly postintentional factors that influence staff behavior. Conflicting expectations around professional roles impeded evidence uptake; physicians report a disconnection between the information they would like to receive and the information communicated; and a high proportion of casual and part-time staff creates challenges for those looking to effect change. These factors are amenable to change in the context of an active, tailored intervention such as academic detailing. This seems especially true when the entire care team is actively engaged and when the intervention can be tailored to the varied determinants of behaviors across different team members.Discussion:Interventions aiming to increase evidence-based practice in the nursing home sector need to move beyond education to explicitly address team functioning and communication. Variability in team functioning requires a flexible intervention with the ability to tailor to individual- A nd home-level needs. Evaluations in this setting may benefit from measuring changes in team functioning as an early indicator of success. © 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This study examines posttraining effects on team skills of health practitioners attending an interprofessional education (IPE) program for team-based Parkinson’s care. Methods: Using a quasi-experimental pre–post design, practitioners (n = 236) in nine professions (physician, nurse and nurse practitioner, physician assistant, occupational, physical and music therapy, speech-language pathology, and social work) completed the validated, self-report Team Skills Scale, before and after the training. Associations of Team Skills Scale change with intention to change practice, measured at end of each training day, and with improved attitudes toward team, knowledge, confidence, and amount of new information were examined. Results: All professions, except physician assistant, significantly improved perceived team skills, as did those showing greatest intention to change practice, with no meaningful differences in magnitude of change across profession groups. Team skills change was significantly associated with improved attitudes toward health care teams, increased knowledge about team and the role of other professions, and new knowledge gained. Confidence in Parkinson’s care showed modest, statistically significant association with team skills improvement. Discussion: The Allied Team Training for Parkinson-IPE program significantly improved perceived team skills of health care practitioners, effectively teaching about skills for collaborative teamwork.

Currently, there are no systematic reviews focusing on continuing education for health care professionals in data skills for QI. The purpose of this systematic review is to define effectiveness and sustainability of QI programs for health care professionals containing a measurement skills component and to identify barriers and facilitators to effectiveness and sustainability. Methods: The systematic review involved study identification, screening, full text review, and data extraction. Four electronics databases and grey literature sources were searched to identify studies published between 2009 and 2019 (11 years). A customized data extraction form was developed. Mixed methods appraisal tool was used for quality assessment and a thematic analysis was conducted for narrative synthesis. Results: Fifty-three studies from 11 countries were included. Most study designs were quantitative descriptive (17/53) and used a blended learning approach (25/53) combining face-to face and distance learning modes. The programs included basic, intermediate, and advanced data skills concepts. Overall, studies reported positive outcomes for participant reaction, learning, and behavior, but reported variable success in sustainability and spread of QI. Discussion: Studies discussed measurement as a key competency for clinical QI. Effectiveness definitions focused on the short-term impact of the programs, whereas sustainability definitions emphasized maintenance of outcomes and skills in the long-term. Factors that influenced effectiveness and sustainability of the included studies were strategic approach to QI, organizational support, intervention design, communication, accountability, leadership support, and learning networks.

However, traditionally, CPD has been planned and taught by clinicians, for clinicians, who tend to be protective of the professional-only environment for learning and are wary of the contributions and participation of patients. Although patients are sometimes included as guest speakers, this role has not typically extended to planning, content development, or serving as key faculty-ultimately excluding the patient perspective from the development and delivery of CPD. The absence of the patient perspective in CPD creates an inadvertent blind spot, hindering the opportunity for clinicians to hone patient-centric skills that are learned and practiced through training. As shared decision-making rises in importance among expected clinician competencies, the involvement of patients is becoming more essential. Patients can be our best teachers, and their inclusion in CPD can engage clinicians' hearts as well as minds and reinforce the reasons why our work matters. Patients are often more willing to engage in clinician education than we may realize, but educators must take the first step and invite them to participate and collaborate. This article will describe how to create a plan for engaging patients as partners, including guidance for gaining buy-in from leadership and faculty; recruiting, training, and nurturing patients; determining roles and responsibilities; and creating a safe space for patient participation. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

It has an online component supplemented by an optional face-to-face (F2F) component. Study outcomes included changes in self-reported knowledge scores for online users and Mentoring Competency Assessment scores for F2F users.Results:One hundred five mentors, mostly women associate professors, used the online program. Online users demonstrated improvement in self-reported knowledge scores. Thirty-eight users additionally completed the F2F program-63% on a clinician-educator track and none with a National Institutes of Health-funded K-award mentee. The self-reported Mentoring Competency Assessment composite score rose from 4.3 ± 1.0 to 5.5 ± 0.8 (paired t = 7.37, df = 37, P <.001) for the F2F participants, with similar improvement noted in the clinician-educator subgroup.Discussion:Users of the online and F2F components of the program improved their self-assessed knowledge and mentoring skill, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of the program.

However, the lack of understanding about mentoring relationship dynamics limits effective recruitment, implementation, and evaluation. Despite decades of publications describing adult mentoring initiatives, few studies examine personality influence in mentoring relationships. This scoping review examined the extent, range, and nature of the research on personality matching in mentoring relationships, and identified research gaps in the literature.Methods:Scoping review methodology guided a search of six databases representing higher education, health sciences education, and professional contexts where mentoring is used. Consistent with the inclusive approach of a scoping review, authors included academic papers and other article types.Results:The scoping review yielded 39 articles. Literature mostly originated in the United States, publication sources represented multiple disciplines, and the context for the majority of articles was the workplace. The most common publication type was a research report. Although all articles addressed personality or mentoring, only three articles examined personality matching and its contribution to the mentoring relationship. Finally, although the Big Five personality traits were cited in multiple studies, other personality frameworks were used.Discussion:Academic medicine expends resources developing and supporting mentoring programs but there remains limited understanding of how best to identify and match mentors and protégés. Further understanding of the role of joint and unique personality traits in academic medicine mentoring relationships seems necessary, if the field continues to invest, time, money, and resources for mentoring programs. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

To identify studies, the databases PubMed, Medline, and CINAHL were searched from 2009 to 2019, and reference lists of included studies were examined. After removal of duplicates, 1367 articles were screened for inclusion. To be included, studies were to be published in peer-reviewed journals, and should not merely be descriptive but report on evaluation outcomes. Articles were reviewed for inclusion by both authors, and data were extracted using a purposely designed data charting form implemented using REDCap.Results:The review identified 49 studies evaluating 36 unique SDM training programs. There was considerable variation in terms of program design and duration. Most programs included an overview of SDM theories and key competencies, as well as SDM skill development through role plays. Few programs provided training in reflective practice, in identifying and working with patients' individually preferred decision-making style, or in relation to SDM in a context of medical uncertainty or ambiguity. Most programs were evaluated descriptively, mostly using mixed methods, and there were 18 randomized controlled trials, showing that training was feasible, well received, and improved participants' knowledge and skills, but was limited in its impact on patients.Discussion:Although there is limited capacity to comment on which types of training programs are most effective, overall training was feasible, well received, and improved participants' knowledge and skills. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of Development of Systems and Education for HPV Vaccination (DOSE HPV), a performance improvement intervention. Methods: Primary care providers (PCPs), nurses, and individuals with leadership roles from pediatric and family medicine practices who attended DOSE HPV intervention sessions participated in qualitative interviews immediately following intervention completion. The study team professionally transcribed interviews and performed qualitative coding using inductive methods. Final analysis employed the Promoting Action on Research implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) model. Results: Twenty-six individuals participated: 12 PCPs, 5 nurses, and 9 individuals with dual leadership and PCP roles. Participants described five factors that they felt contributed to program success: (1) evidence-based, goal-directed education; (2) personalized data feedback; (3) clinical leadership support; (4) collaborative facilitation; (5) repeated contacts/longitudinal structure of the intervention. Barriers to implementing the intervention included: (1) inability to standardize workflow across practices; (2) low pediatric volume, (3) competing priorities/lack of incentives, (4) ineffective involvement of nurses, (5) poor communication between clinical leadership and staff. Discussion: Although many HPV testing interventions have been implemented, findings have been mixed. It is clear that having an effective, evidence-based intervention by itself is not enough to get it into practice. Rather, it is crucial to consider implementation factors to ensure consistent implementation and sustainability. Key factors for the success of the DOSE HPV intervention appear to include a collaborative approach, provision of useful evidence to motivate behavior change, and repeated contacts to ensure accountability for implementing changes. Workflow issues, ineffective lines of communication, and competing priorities at both the visit and the patient and population management levels can hinder implementation.

However, there is no accreditation requirement for OH to prepare students across the professions for collaborative practice. This study aimed to explore the perspectives of faculty across the medical, veterinary, and public health programs about the need, opportunities, and challenges of developing OH in the curricula.Methods:In this qualitative study, faculty across the three disciplines were invited to participate in audio-recorded, focus group interviews. Recordings were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using inductive and deductive thematic analysis.Results:All participants recognized the need for OH as a critical concept for preparing students for collaborative practice. Opportunities were identified for shared learning and research across the disciplines, particularly through the use of interprofessional education. The lack of an accreditation mandate for OH in the medical curriculum was perceived to be the greatest challenge, leading to an anticipation of significant resistance among medical educators and students.Discussion:Successful development of OH in all three curricula is vital to prepare students for current and future threats to global health. The role of accreditation bodies in ensuring medical, veterinary, and public health curricula prepare students for these threats is crucial. Implications for practice include strategies for persuading medical educators and medical students to embrace OH in the curriculum and promote a culture of shared learning. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Online, interprofessional training programs are valuable; however, interpretation and comparison of outcomes remain challenging because of inconsistent use of evaluation frameworks. In this study, we used level 5 of Moore's evaluation framework to examine whether an online training program in intensive tobacco cessation counseling achieved sustained performance change among HCPs across multiple health disciplines.Methods:The evaluation sample included 62 HCPs with direct clinical duties, who completed the online Training Enhancement in Applied Counseling and Health (TEACH) Core Course in 2015 and 2016. We compared self-reported changes in cessation counseling and clinical practices across eight core competencies from baseline to 6-month follow-up using McNemar's tests and descriptive analyses.Results:Compared with baseline, significantly more HCPs reported providing cessation counseling at 6-month follow-up (44% versus 81%, P <.001). HCPs also reported significant increases in engagement in six of the eight core competencies.Discussion:Online training in intensive tobacco cessation treatment can result in sustained performance improvement at 6 months. However, availability of resources and clinical context may influence the extent to which HCPs are able to implement their learned skills. Furthermore, continuing education programs should consider the use of consistent evaluation frameworks to promote cross program comparisons. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Detailer feedback is important for program evaluation but is rarely systematically collected. The study's objective was to develop a measure capturing the detailer's perception of the effectiveness of an AD program.Methods:A six-item measure with a five-level scale was initially developed from the literature review and expert panel consultation. Item constructs were usefulness, acceptability, feasibility, relevance, effectiveness of communication, and readiness to change. The measure was piloted, refined, and tested during an opioid-focused AD program that included two visits. The instrument structure was evaluated using exploratory factor analysis, measure reliability was assessed using item-item correlation (rho), corrected item-total correlation, Cronbach alpha (α), and item response theory.Results:The initial six-item instrument demonstrated unidimensionality. The Cronbach α for the measure was 0.74 (visit 1) and 0.79 (visit 2); one item (relevance) was redundant (α = 0.73 and 0.79 when deleted) and therefore dropped. Items related to usefulness, acceptability, and readiness to change displayed high item-item correlation (rho ≥ 0.50) and contributed the most information and seemed to operate as a single scale (ie, ""likelihood to change"") based on item response theory analysis. Items related to feasibility and communication were slightly different constructs and should be reported separately.Discussion:The five-item detailer assessment of visit effectiveness (the ""DAVE"") instrument provides a standardized approach to assess AD. Further study of its validity and broader use in other programs and educational outreach activities is encouraged.

Our purpose was to contribute to this evidence by evaluating a high-stakes assessment for assessor inter-rater reliability and the relationship between performance on individual assessment components and overall performance. We did so to determine if the assessment tools identify specific competency needs of the assessed physicians and contribute to our understanding of physician dyscompetence more broadly. Method: Four assessors independently reviewed 102 video-recorded assessments and scored physicians on seven assessment components and overall performance. Inter-rater reliability was measured using intraclass correlation coefficients using a multiple rater, consistency, two-way random effect model. Analysis of variance with least-significant difference post-hoc analyses examined if the mean component scores differed significantly by quartile ranges of overall performance. Linear regression analysis determined the extent to which each component score was associated with overall performance. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficients ranged between 0.756 and 0.876 for all components scored and was highest for overall performance. Regression indicated that individual component scores were positively associated with overall performance. Levels of variation in component scores were significantly different across quartile ranges with higher variability in poorer performers. Discussion: High-stake assessments can be conducted reliably and identify performance gaps of potentially dyscompetent physicians. Physicians who performed well tended to do so in all aspects evaluated, whereas those who performed poorly demonstrated areas of strength and weakness. Understanding that dyscompetence rarely means a complete or catastrophic lapse competence is vital to understanding how educational needs change through a physician’s career.

Postactivity learner evaluations were used to measure both satisfaction and ""commitment to change""-the percentage of learners who committed in making a change in their practice as a result of their participation.Results:We found education that was interactive and leveraged elements of social learning theory produced the greatest commitment to change the score. Lower scores were obtained for more passive education formats.

This study examined data from five different specialties to identify variation in participation in assessment activities, examine differences in the learning stimulated by assessment, assess the frequency and type of planned changes, and assess the association between learning, discussion, and planned changes.Methods:E-portfolio data were categorized and analyzed descriptively. Chi-squared tests examined associations.Results:A total of 2854 anatomical pathologists, cardiologists, gastroenterologists, ophthalmologists, and orthopedic surgeons provided data about 6063 assessment activities. Although there were differences in the role that learning played by discipline and assessment type, the most common activities documented across all specialties were self-assessment programs (n = 2122), feedback on teaching (n = 1078), personal practice assessments which the physician did themselves (n = 751), annual reviews (n = 682), and reviews by third parties (n = 661). Learning occurred for 93% of the activities and was associated with change. For 2126 activities, there were planned changes. Activities in which there was a discussion with a peer or supervisor were more likely to result in a change.Conclusions and Discussion:Although specialists engaged in many types of assessment activities to meet the Maintenance of Certification program requirements, there was variability in how assessment stimulated learning and planned changes. It seems that peer discussion may be an important component in fostering practice change and forming plans for improvement which bears further study. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Although the teaching and student support dimensions of health professionals' educational role are highly visible in the literature, other nontraditional elements are not. This study presents a broader conceptualization of health professionals' educational role, with a focus on the strategic dimensions of their role.Methods:Participants were health professionals from different clinical backgrounds and teaching settings, with a formal role in education. Data were collected using a survey (n = 41) and interviews (n = 9), and this article focuses on reporting the qualitative findings of this study. Thematic analysis was used for data interpretation.Results:Health professionals have three strategic dimensions to their educational role. The first strategic dimension is educational advocacy, which is aimed at championing education at different levels and parts of the educational system and building educational capacity. The second strategic dimension is educational quality improvement which is focused on shifting narratives around education and educational change in health service settings and leveraging educational evidence. The final strategic dimension is educational brokerage which is oriented at connecting clinical and educational communities and building trust and consensus.Discussion:Beyond the microlevel of learning and teaching, health professionals engage in strategic work that is focused on the broader educational mission within health. Continuing professional development initiatives can empower health professionals to optimize these strategic and system-focused educational roles and responsibilities. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

We asked faculty about their research mentoring practices and what would support their skills and abilities as ongoing and effective research mentors.Methods:Twenty-two experienced mentors were interviewed and asked about perceived areas for improvement, and challenges and facilitators to continued research mentoring. Responses were analyzed with qualitative techniques using semistructured interviews, grounded theory, and a constant comparative analytic strategy.Results:The average time since the completion of the doctoral degree was 26 years. Twenty-one participants believed that more comprehensive institutional acknowledgment for their efforts would enhance research mentoring. This specifically included acknowledging their time spent and service (ie, effort) in multiple in-person and behind-the-scenes tasks. These research mentoring efforts were largely viewed as overlooked by the traditional focus on the achievement of tangible outcomes. Participants thought that a formal plan to organize research mentoring (such as a mentor's charter, and continuing education tailored to both novice and experienced research mentors) was needed to promote evolution of skills and documentation of time and service. Possible methods to support research mentors were suggested and included financial support for travel to national meetings, assistance in developing new projects, and consideration of mentoring activities in the process for academic promotion.Discussion:Research mentors wanted their achievements, time spent, and service (ie, effort) to be acknowledged by the institution. A formal written mentoring charter and corresponding continuing education could facilitate acknowledging achievements, time, and service and thus help to sustain academic research mentoring. © 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Health professional continuing education programs have been proposed for facilitating patient participation in ACP; however, their impacts on participants, patient and clinical outcomes, and organizational approaches to ACP are not well understood. Methods: This systematic literature review examined interventional studies of education programs conducted with health professionals and care staff across a broad range of settings. Five electronic databases were searched up to June 2020, and a manual search of reference lists was conducted. The quality of studies was appraised by the first, second, and third authors. Results: Of the 7993 articles identified, 45 articles met the inclusion criteria. Program participants were predominantly medical, nursing, and social work staff, and students. Interventions were reported to improve participants’ self-perceived confidence, knowledge, and skills; however, objectively measured improvements were limited. Multimodal programs that combined initial didactic teaching and role-play simulation tasks with additional activities were most effective in producing increased ACP activity in medical records. Evidence for improved clinical outcomes was limited. Discussion: Further studies that use rigorous methodological approaches would provide further evidence about what produces improved patient and clinical outcomes. Needs analyses and quality indicators could be considered to determine the most appropriate and effective education resources and monitor their impacts. The potential contribution of a broader range of health professionals and interprofessional learning approaches could be considered to ultimately improve patient care.

What factors modulate the impact of testing in practitioners are unclear. We aimed to improve capacity to support maintenance of competence by exploring variables that influence the value of web-based pretesting.Methods:Family physicians belonging to a practice-based learning program studied two educational modules independently or in small groups. Before learning sessions they completed a needs assessment and were assigned to either sit a pretest intervention or read a relevant review article. After the learning session, they completed an outcome test, indicated plans to change practice, and subsequently documented changes made.Results:One hundred twelve physicians completed the study, 92 in small groups. The average lag between tests was 6.3 weeks. Relative to those given a review article, physicians given a pretest intervention: (1) reported spending less time completing the assigned task (16.7 versus 25.7 minutes); (2) performed better on outcome test questions that were repeated from the pretest (65.9% versus 58.7%); and (3) when the learning module was completed independently, reported making a greater proportion of practice changes to which they committed (80.0% versus 45.0%). Knowledge gain was unrelated to physicians' stated needs.Discussion:Low-stakes formative quizzes, delivered with feedback, can influence the amount of material practicing physicians remember from an educational intervention independent of perceptions regarding the need to engage in continuing professional development on the particular topic.

A previous systematic literature review described a lack of objective evaluation for learning needs assessments in primary care physicians. This scoping review updates the literature on uses of objective evaluations to assess physicians' unperceived learning needs in CME/CPD. Identifying and understanding these approaches can inform the development of educational programs that are relevant to clinical practice and patient care. The study objectives were to (1) scope the literature since the last systematic review published in 1999; (2) conduct a comprehensive search for studies and reports that explore innovative tools and approaches to identify physicians' unperceived learning needs; (3) summarize, compare, and classify the identified approaches; and (4) map any gaps in the literature to identify future areas of research.Methods:A scoping review was used to ""map""the literature on current knowledge regarding approaches to unperceived needs assessment using conceptual frameworks for planning and assessing CME/CPD activities.Results:Two prominent gaps were identified: (1) performance-based assessment strategies are highly recommended in nonresearch articles yet have low levels of implementation in published studies and (2) analysis of secondary data through patient input or environmental scanning is emphasized in grey literature implementation strategies more so than in peer-reviewed theoretical and research articles.Discussion:Future evaluations should continue to incorporate multiple strategies and focus on making unperceived needs assessments actionable by describing strategies for resource management.

Although patients are sometimes involved in delivering CPD, they are less likely to be involved in education planning. At our institution, patients have sometimes acted as consultants in the design of CPD. The problem we address is how to engage patients as partners throughout the design process. We applied principles of authentic patient engagement and lessons learned from patient involvement in undergraduate health professional education to the design of CPD for family physicians.We created a partnership between the CPD Office and Patient and Community Partnership for Education, a unit with a history of patient involvement in the education of health professional students. Practices for meaningful involvement were identified through literature review, environmental scan, and interviewing key informants, including patients involved in health professional education at the university. These principles and practices were applied to the development of a CPD module on end-of-life care. Patient partners contributed new perspectives and some CPD providers reassessed components of their own practice as a result. Lessons learned include the need for stakeholder buy-in; mechanisms to identify those patients best able to contribute expertise; ways to facilitate involvement that work for both patients and CPD providers; the importance of feedback mechanisms to patient partners; and recognition for patient contributions. CPD offices should view integration of patient partners in program planning as an opportunity to engage in ongoing quality improvement. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

There is a paucity of data on podcasting as a means of continuing medical education (CME) for attending physicians.Methods:The authors performed an exploratory survey of a convenience sample of listeners to a Pediatric Hospital Medicine podcast to learn about their attitudes regarding podcasting. A 17-question survey consisting of demographic data, attitudinal questions, and qualitative questions was administered electronically in February 2018.Results:At the time of the survey, the 12 podcast episodes were downloaded 17,288 times, with 162 CME credits being issued. Of 129 respondents, 75.2% were attendings. The majority agreed the podcast was of ""high educational value"" and was of equal or better educational value as medical journals or national conferences. Qualitative content analysis revealed listeners valued the convenience of the podcast, and community-based hospitalists felt the podcast connected them to the broader hospitalist community.Discussion:Our respondents found podcasting to be a beneficial and convenient learning method. The ability to apply for CME credit was not a major motivation for listening. Further research is needed to investigate more objective outcomes and assess attitudes of a random sampling of physicians as opposed to a self-selected sample. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

An educational board game embracing the principles of situated learning was developed with the purpose of promoting clinical reasoning skills and mindfulness. Methods: Iter Vitae was used in a national pharmacy meeting CPD session. An evaluation was conducted by a voluntary survey to gather perceptions of game-based instruction. Results: Ninety of 115 session-attendees completed the anonymous survey. Participants strongly agreed that Iter Vitae is an effective learning tool of appropriate complexity for CPD sessions. Participant perceptions suggest that playing Iter Vitae may enhance clinical knowledge, foster critical thinking, and influence provider empathy. Open-ended responses revealed appreciation of collaborative learning within authentic case scenarios. Discussion: This game-based CPD session gave participants an opportunity to develop elements of mindful practice embedded within authentic case scenarios. Further research on game-based instruction is needed to determine its effects on knowledge and skill acquisition, retention, and impact on clinical practice.

The aim of this study is to gain insight into learning outcomes on the fourth level of the Kirkpatrick evaluation model for systematically deployed quality improvement projects performed by health care professionals during a Masters in Healthcare Quality and Safety in the Netherlands.Methods:The researchers reviewed 35 projects led by health care professionals in 16 different hospitals to determine their scopes and effects. Afterward, professionals took an online survey to determine the extent of their project's sustainability and spread.Results:Improving health care safety was the most prevalent quality dimension (n = 11, 31%). A positive change was measured by professionals for 64% (n = 35) of the primary outcomes. Statistical significance was measured in 19 (35%) of the outcomes, of which nine (47%) were found to have a statistically significant effect. A minority of professionals (17%) judged their project as sustained by the department, while some stated that the intervention (37%) or the results of the project (11%) had spread.Discussion:Although most projects indicated an improvement in their primary outcomes, only a few resulted in statistically significant changes. Teaching professionals in using evaluation methods that take into account the complex context where these projects are performed and teaching them leadership skills is needed to reduce the likelihood of unmeasured outcomes. Analyzing learning experiences of professionals in performing the project is important to see what they learned from performing quality improvement projects, providing experiences that may lead to sustainable effects in future projects. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Many may not recognize their impact on the learning environment or prioritize their development as educators. Our objective was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a faculty development approach, the “Medical Education Roadshow,” which delivered succinct, actionable faculty development at regularly scheduled, departmental clinical business meetings. Methods: Between October 2018 and October 2019, we conducted six 15-minute “roadshows” for the Obstetrics and Gynecology faculty at one academic medical center. Each roadshow addressed a foundational education topic in an interactive manner with an emphasis on one take-away skill in teaching behavior. We utilized a simple, anonymous evaluation tool to obtain participant feedback and analyzed quantitative data descriptively and qualitative data thematically. Results: A total of 174 of 265 evaluations were returned (65.6% response rate). Participants indicated that the roadshows helped them think about teaching more effectively and offered one or more practical daily practice tips. Qualitative findings coalesced into two themes. First, participants identified multiple intended practice changes, including using more effective teaching strategies, being more deliberate about feedback, and modeling exemplary professional behavior. Second, participants recommended multiple improvement opportunities and future topics. Discussion: Busy clinical faculty were highly receptive to opportunities to improve as educators through the “roadshow” approach.

The Health Education and Training Institute (HETI) and its operational model for districts (District HETI Operational Model), is a novel approach that supports this imperative for over 155,000 staff working across the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The model uses three principles in education and training development. These include collaborative partnerships, rapid resource development, and effective leadership within virtual teams. A state-wide learning management system has been implemented to support this initiative. Over 451 standardized, education, and training online modules have been developed for medical, nursing and midwifery, dental, allied health, and nonclinical NSW Health employees since 2013. These educational resources are accessible 24 hours a day. Cost-effective online programs have enabled more than 13.6 million learner completions. Program evaluations highlight the value of these resources in providing a positive learning experience. Furthermore, the District HETI Operational Model has been recognized by multiple national and international excellence awards in learning and development. The principles of the District HETI Operational Model apply to other health organizations that may choose to adopt a similar model. Such a model may support equity of access to contemporary, standardized, evidence-based education resources for health professionals working across geographically and clinically diverse environments. Implementation of a similar model for future CPD interventions warrants consideration by practitioners, researchers, and policymakers.

We developed and evaluated a 2-hour pilot interprofessional workshop to improve the communication and relational skills of pediatric surgeons and nurse practitioners. Methods: Focus groups with families identified key challenges in the process of informed consent. An interprofessional team, including parents whose children had experienced complex surgeries, developed the workshop collaboratively. A realistic simulation with professional actors portraying parents allowed surgical staff to practice communication skills and receive feedback about the parent perspective. Participants completed a postworkshop evaluation to determine whether the workshop met its objectives and whether they would change practice. Results: Five key themes identified for the workshop included customize communication; align expectations; share clinical uncertainty; recognize/attend to emotions; and identify team members. Thirty-five clinicians participated in a workshop, and 89% completed evaluations. Three-quarters reported the learning to be valuable, and 64% were likely to change practice. Eighty-seven percent would recommend the workshop to other colleagues, and 58 to 74% felt more prepared to achieve each of eight specific skills. Discussion: An innovative workshop for pediatric surgical practitioners to align family-clinician expectations can help improve clinician communication skills and comfort with informed consent. Keys to workshop development included involving parents to identify themes and participate as workshop co-faculty; enlisting leadership and recruiting surgical champions; and using preexisting meetings to ease scheduling challenges of busy practitioners. Booster sessions may facilitate the desired cultural changes. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120856513"

The ""interactive, no-prep"" approach, using breakout rooms within a videoconferencing system, required no prior learner preparation.Methods:From March to May 2020, learners were invited to participate in a monthly 60-minute virtual MEJC. A needs assessment survey informed article selection. Facilitators developed a presentation to provide background and describe the article's research question(s). In breakout groups, learners generated study designs to answer the research question(s). After the actual study methodology and results were revealed, learners engaged in facilitated open discussion. After the session, learners completed an electronic survey to rate perceived usefulness and suggest improvement areas.Results:A total of 15 learners participated; most completed the survey (13/15; 87%). The MEJC was rated as very or extremely useful. Qualitative feedback indicated that it was convenient, allowed creativity, and enabled rich discussion without prior preparation. When possible, improvement suggestions were implemented.Discussion:The authors offer an evidence-based MEJC approach that is free, interactive with virtual breakout rooms and requires no prior learner preparation.

However, there is limited insight into how perceived divergent feedback affects physicians’ subsequent performance scores. Methods: During 2012 to 2018, 103 physicians were evaluated twice by 684 peers, 242 residents, 999 coworkers, and themselves in three MSF performance domains. Mixed-effect models quantified associations between the outcome variable “score changes” between first and second MSF evaluations, and the explanatory variable “negative discrepancy score” (number of items that physicians rated themselves higher compared with their assessors’ scores) at the first MSF evaluation. Whether associations differed across assessor groups and across a physician’s years of experience as a doctor was analyzed too. Results: Forty-nine percent of physicians improved their total MSF score at the second evaluation, as assessed by others. Number of negative discrepancies was negatively associated with score changes in domains “organization and (self)management” (b = 20.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 20.03 to 20.02; SE = 0.004) and “patient-centeredness” (b = 20.03; 95% CI, 20.03 to 20.02; SE = 0.004). For “professional attitude,” only negative associations between score changes and negative discrepancies existed for physicians with more than 6-year experience (b6–10yearsofexperience = 20.03; 95% CI, 20.05 to 20.003; SE = 0.01; b16–20yearsofexperience = 20.03; 95% CI, 20.06 to 20.004; SE = 0.01). Discussion: The extent of performance improvement was less for physicians confronted with negative discrepancies. Performance scores actually declined when physicians overrated themselves on more than half of the feedback items. PA score changes of more experienced physicians confronted with negative discrepancies and were affected more adversely. These physicians might have discounted feedback due to having more confidence in own performance. Future work should investigate how MSF could improve physicians’ performance taking into account physicians’ confidence.

This article considers the use of a transformative learning approach to highlight patient agency and personhood in health care. An educational intervention using patient narratives was introduced in a maternity unit to foster a culture of listening and responsiveness to women's voices. This article reports the impact on staff and student learning, empathy, and reflective practice. Methods: A total of 245 interprofessional providers participated in 14 workshops over a 16-month period. Participants represented a range of health professions including medicine, midwifery, nursing, and allied professions. Senior management, administrators, and peer support volunteers also attended. Session sizes ranged from 5 to 60 attendees. The format included documentary-style videos of patient feedback followed by audience discussion. Discussion points were collected and qualitatively analyzed for participants' critical reflection, emotional engagement, cognitive dissonance, and perspective transformation. Results: Learners reflected on the client-caregiver relationship and care provision. Staff and students showed empathy for the women sharing their stories. Learners were disturbed by failings in care and wished to improve services. All provider groups highlighted the importance of communication, compassion, and patient autonomy as key elements of maternity care. Discussion: Multiprofessional learners engaged emotionally with women's narratives and reflected critically on their roles in maternity care. Learners' responses showed evidence of transformative learning. Staff and students recognized the value of providing respectful, empathic care. Educational interventions highlighting patients' voices may promote patient autonomy by reducing dehumanization in health care. © 2020 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090705376"

This study explored the participation and evaluation of CME e-learning courses for Italian health care professionals addressing leading causes of maternal mortality identified by the Italian Obstetric Surveillance System (ItOSS) at the Italian National Health Institute, namely postpartum hemorrhage and pregnancy hypertensive disorders. Methods: A model for two online free 12-hour case-based training courses was used. Data on participants were collected, anonymized, and transferred to the Italian National Health Institute for later analysis. Participants were requested to sign an online informed consent form. Results: Twenty-one thousand five hundred thirty-two health care professionals enrolled to the courses from 2014 to 2017 as follows: midwives (14,187, 65.9%); obstetricians (3,716, 17.2%); anesthesiologists (1,896, 8.8%); and other medical specialists (1,733, 8.0%). Overall, 85% of participants acquired CME credits. Participants’ satisfaction on quality, efficacy, and relevance was very high. Discussion: ItOSS courses were able to reach a substantial number of different professional profiles involved in perinatal care all over the country; ItOSS courses can be considered an effective way to spread evidence-based good clinical practices. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to verify the improvement in professional health care skills and patient outcomes.

Along with this has come an appreciation of applicability of sociocultural learning theories, which frame learning as occurring within “communities of practice” or learning being “situated” within a workplace environment where collaboration and social interaction are fundamental to the learning process. These conceptualizations of workplace learning are ideally suited to health professions where learners are supervised in clinical work environments and then continue to work in team-based environments as graduates. However, what happens to workplace learning for novice practitioners who have limited periods of clinical supervision and then graduate into solo or small group practices (which may also be in rural or remote locations) and embark on long working careers without supervision? This paper argues workplace learning needs to be scaffolded and supported to reach its full potential in these environments. Drawing on workplace-based learning theory, we highlight the ubiquitous nature of learning in the workplace, the importance of active engagement, reflection, and individual meaning making. Through this reframing of traditional notions of continuing professional development, we emphasize the importance of patients, students, and other practitioners as partners in workplace learning for solo practitioners. We also focus on the role of educators, professional associations, and regulators in helping solo practitioners recognize, access, and maximize the learning opportunities inherent in relatively isolated practice environments.

To energize the conversation on gender inequality at one academic medical center, chairs and women faculty were surveyed to identify barriers faced by women navigating their careers. A symposium with short talks to increase awareness, a panel with University leaders to discuss issues and successful strategies to overcome gaps, and focus groups to delve further into key areas that underlie inequity through an active café style format were planned and implemented. This multifaceted approach resulted in a wealth of knowledge. The symposium and panel highlighted important relevant issues and offered personal strategies for successful career advancement, while the focus group discussions further identified barriers and inspired ongoing efforts across departments and novel approaches to overcome three key issues (work-life integration, deliberate promotion of mentor/sponsor relationships, and overcoming unconscious bias) identified through the initial surveys. Compiled data were then disseminated to participants and University leaders to enhance awareness of available programs and prompt action in critical areas lacking support. Overall, the approach indicated that securing support from leaders and the academic community alike are pertinent to emphasize actions needed to overcome issues affecting women in academic medicine. Moreover, bringing leaders and faculty together for an informational session and brainstorming appears to energize the conversation. Such efforts can ultimately instill change and establish an inclusive environment where all members of the academic medicine community can thrive.

However, lack of effective structuring threatens the viability of mentoring programs, precipitating ethical concerns about mentoring. This review aims to answer the question ""what is known about mentoring structures in novice mentoring among medical students and junior doctors in medicine and surgery postings?,"" which will guide the design of a consistent structure to novice mentoring.Methods:Levac (2010)'s framework was used to guide this systematic scoping review of mentoring programs in medicine and surgery published between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2019 in PubMed, ScienceDirect, ERIC, Embase, Scopus, Mednar, and OpenGrey. A ""split approach"" involving concurrent independent use of a directed content analysis and thematic approach was used to analyze included articles.Results:Three thousand three hundred ninety-five abstracts were identified. There was concordance between the 3 themes and categories identified in analyzing the 71 included articles. These were the host organization, mentoring stages, and evaluations.Conclusion:The data reveal the need for balance between ensuring consistency and flexibility to meet the individual needs of stakeholders throughout the stages of the mentoring process. The Generic Mentoring Framework provides a structured approach to ""balancing"" flexibility and consistency in mentoring processes. The Generic Mentoring Framework is reliant upon appropriate, holistic, and longitudinal assessments of the mentoring process to guide adaptations to mentoring processes and ensure effective support and oversight of the program. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

To respond to emergent teaching preparedness and leadership readiness in new administrative roles, an educational series taught by clinical faculty and staff was offered at noontime.Methods:The series focused on administrative skills, teaching techniques, and student success. The curricular strategies employed were the menu approach for educational offerings and spiral sequencing of curricula. Faculty teaching preparedness and leadership readiness were measured by an electronic questionnaire devised by the author and contributors of this article. Descriptive statistics were conducted for outcomes.Results:Findings indicate noontime education using a menu approach of listed offerings and curricular themes spiraled was a feasible faculty development method for teaching preparedness and leadership readiness for new administrative roles. Specifically, faculty reported increased use of active learning strategies after attending the noontime educational series.Conclusions:Next steps include longitudinal follow-up with our faculty participants to measure retention and sustainability of our findings, as well as additional instructional strategies that we could incorporate into future educational sessions. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Spacing-out study or practice over time allows the brain multiple opportunities to process new and complex information in an efficient way, thus increasing the likelihood of mastery and memory. Research from cognitive psychology and neuroscience provide the rationale for distributed practice, and examples of its implementation in health professions education have begun to appear in the literature. If used appropriately or extended creatively, some common CPD interventions can fully leverage distributed practice. Through increased understanding, CPD planners can benefit from distributed practice in efforts to improve educational activities, and CPD participants can benefit by making more informed educational choices.

However, evidence indicates that CME is often poorly developed and inappropriately used. Consequently, there has been increasing interest in the literature in evaluating wider contexts at play in CME development and delivery. In this article, the authors present a unified theoretical framework, grounded in learning theories, to explore the role of contextual factors in public health CME for health care practitioners. Discussion with pedagogical experts together with a narrative review of learning theories within medical and social science literature informed the framework’s development. The need to consider sociocultural theories of learning within medical education restricted suitable theories to those that recognized contexts beyond the individual learner; adopted a systems approach to evaluate interactions between contexts and learner; and considered learning as more than mere acquisition of knowledge. Through a process of rigorous critical analysis, two theoretical models emerged as contextually appropriate: Biggs principle of constructive alignment and Bronfenbrenner bioecological model of human development. Biggs principle offers theoretical clarity surrounding interactive factors that encourage lifelong learning, whereas the Bronfenbrenner model expands on these factor’s roles across multiple system levels. The authors explore how unification into a single framework complements each model while elaborating on its fundamental and practical applications. The unified theoretical framework presented in this article addresses the limitations of isolated frameworks and allows for the exploration of the applicability of wider learning theories in CME research.

Previous studies show that, when asked, general pediatricians (GPeds) self-report performing these procedures infrequently. When examined using the knowledge translation model, this low procedural performance frequency, especially by GPeds, may indicate a problem within the primary care landscape.Methods:This was a descriptive study using the Partners For Kids, an accountable care organization, database to obtain how frequently each of the procedures was performed for a geographically representative sample of GPeds in central Ohio.Results:A total of 296 physicians participated in Partners For Kids. Nearly one-third practiced for more than 15 years (n = 83, 28%) and one-third also lived in a rural region (n = 78, 26.4%). The most commonly billed procedure was administering immunizations (n = 79,292, 92.3%); the least was peripheral intravenous catheter placement (n = 2, 0.002%). Most procedures were completed in the office-based setting.Discussion:General pediatricians in central Ohio do not frequently perform the 13 recommended procedures of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Evaluation of this problem using the knowledge translation model shows that potential barriers could be inadequate training during or after residency or more likely that these procedures are not necessary in GPeds' current scope of practice. The next step should be to see, from the practitioner's perspective, what procedures are important to their daily practice. Adapting this knowledge to the local context will help target continuing medical education/continuing professional development interventions. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

We sought to create and deliver a 1-day interprofessional workshop to enhance de-prescribing knowledge and skills among health care professionals.Methods:Workshop development was based on the Adult Learning Theory and the Theoretical Domains Framework. The workshop addressed provider-related barriers, was created and delivered by an interprofessional team, and combined didactic and active learning techniques. Targeted participants included physicians, advanced practice providers (nurse practitioners and physician's assistants), pharmacists, and clinic staff. Interprofessional workgroups were created a priori. Participants were asked to complete a postprogram evaluation, including whether they would implement changes to practice, teaching, research, or administrative duties after participation.Results:We created an in-person, 5.5 credit hour, interprofessional de-prescribing workshop that comprised six sessions: (1) polypharmacy and de-prescribing overview; (2) identification of potentially inappropriate medications; (3) prioritization of medications for de-prescribing; (4) design and implementation of a de-prescribing plan; (5) principles for a patient-centered approach; and (6) suggestions for successful collaboration. Forty-one participants attended the workshop, and 38 (92.7%) completed the postprogram assessment. Participants felt they were likely to implement changes in practice, teaching, research, or administrative duties, rating themselves with a mean of 9.2 (SD = 1.06) on a 1 to 10 scale. Ultimately, 96.6% would recommend the workshop to others.Discussion:Based on participant feedback, the workshop catalyzed intention to change practice, teaching, research, or administrative duties. Other institutions seeking to change the complex behavior of de-prescribing may wish to model this development and delivery strategy. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The purpose was to identify participants' learning from simulation-based spiritual generalist workshops and application to practice.Methods:Interdisciplinary participants completed self-report demographic questionnaires before the workshops and questionnaires after workshops that listed open-ended take-home learning. Responses were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. A subgroup was surveyed 3 to 9 months after training to examine whether and how participants had incorporated workshop learning into clinical work.Results:Workshop participants 181/211 (85.8%) reported learning in four categories: core values and skills of spiritual generalists, understanding spirituality/religion and its role in health care, interfacing with chaplaincy, and interprofessional teamwork. Of the subsample, 73.5% (25/34) completed surveys 3 to 9 months after training. Of those, 25/25 (100%) reported drawing on what they learned in workshops, and 24/25 (96%) reported making clinical practice changes.Discussion:One-day spiritual generalist simulation-based workshops can improve continuing professional development learning experiences to provide generalist level of spiritual care. Workshops offered valuable learning and resulted in applicable clinical skills across professional roles. At 3 to 9 months after training, participants reported improved spiritual screening, recognition of spiritual distress, and referral to chaplaincy.

While synthesized evidence shows CPD in general to be effective, effects vary, in part due to variation in CPD interventions and limited understanding of CPD mechanisms of action. We introduce two behavioral science tools - the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy version 1 and the Theoretical Domains Framework - that can be used to characterize the content of CPD interventions and the determinants of behaviour potentially targeted by the interventions, respectively. We provide a worked example of the use of these tools in coding the educational content of 43 diabetes quality improvement trials containing clinician education as part of their multicomponent intervention. Fourteen (of a possible 93; 15%) behavior change techniques were identified in the clinician education content of the quality improvement trials, suggesting a focus of addressing the behavioral determinants beliefs about consequences, knowledge, skills, and social influences, of diabetes care providers' behavior. We believe that the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy version 1 and Theoretical Domains Framework offer a novel lens to analyze the CPD content of existing evidence and inform the design and evaluation of future CPD interventions.

The purpose of this study is to report on further refinement of such a measurement instrument, the Assessment of Interprofessional Team Collaboration Scale (AITCS) first published in 2012. To support this refinement, two objectives were set: Objective 1: to determine whether the items from the data collected in 2016 load on the same factors as found for the 2012 version of the 37-item AITCS. Objective 2: to determine whether the items in the subscales of the AITCS could be reduced while retaining psychometric properties similar to those from the earlier versions of the AITCS. Methods: Initially, the overall data sets of 1002 respondents from two hospitals and four community agencies were analyzed for demographics and scale and subscale mean values, SDs, and mean item scores. After deletion of respondents because of missing data, 967 respondents were available for the first analysis. An exploratory factor analysis was then conducted to determine the factor structure. All respondents with any random missing data were further removed to reduce the data set to 676 responses, followed by a confirmatory factor analysis to find a model fit resulting in an item reduction in the scale. Results: The result was a 23-item AITCS-II for practitioners that retained acceptable levels of reliability and validity within 3 subscales-partnership (8 items), cooperation (8 items), and coordination (7 items). Discussion: The shortened version of the AITCS-II is a valid and reliable instrument that can be used to assess collaboration in health care teams in practice settings. © 2018 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education,and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053938965"

However, there is a lack of accredited CPD related to this important area of preconception and antenatal care. Therefore, aims were to evaluate HPs' reactions to accredited online CPD regarding weight management for pregnancy and their knowledge, attitudes, confidence, and commitment to provide women with advice after completing the course. Methods: A mixed-methods evaluation was based on the New World Kirkpatrick Model (NWKM). Accredited online CPD was developed by experts in maternal nutrition and weight management. Participants completed a questionnaire before (n = 136) and after (n = 65) the weight management components of the course. McNemar and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to evaluate paired data (n = 36) (p < .05). Deductive content analyses explored free-text responses (n = 65). Results: Participants' reactions to the online CPD were encouraging, facilitating increases in perceptions of the importance of weight management for pregnancy and confidence to provide advice. Quantitative measures assessed no change in participants' knowledge; however, qualitative analyses revealed an increase in participants' knowledge of communication strategies that they intend to apply in practice. Discussion: The NWKM facilitated an evaluation of HPs' encouraging reactions to online CPD and the affective constructs of education including attitudes, confidence, and commitment to provide advice. Online CPD should be developed with collaboration between universities/professional associations and health care providers, so that evaluation of organizational change and clinical outcomes is possible.  © 2019 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071713191"

A community of practice (CoP) is one tool that may enhance competencies and support practice change. This study explores the utility of an interprofessional CoP as an adjunct to a CME program in tobacco addiction treatment (Training Enhancement in Applied Counselling and Health [TEACH] Project) to promote and sustain practice change. Methods: A prospective cohort design was utilized to examine the long-term impact of the TEACH CoP on practice change. An online survey was administered to TEACH-trained practitioners to assess perceived feasibility, importance, and confidence related to course competencies, involvement in TEACH CoP activities, engagement in knowledge transfer (KT), and implementation of new programming. Chi-square tests were used to detect differences in KT and program development associated with CoP participation. Course competency scores from immediate postcourse surveys and long-term follow-up surveys were compared. Results: No significant differences in participant characteristics were found between those who did (n = 300) and did not (n = 122) participate in the TEACH CoP. Mean self-perceived competency scores were greater immediately after course than at long-term follow-up; however, self-ratings of competency in pharmacological interventions and motivational interviewing were higher at follow-up. TEACH CoP participation was associated with significantly greater engagement in KT and implementation of new programming after training. Discussion: The findings from this evaluation suggest the value of interprofessional CoPs offered posttraining as a mechanism to enhance practice. CME providers should consider offering CoPs as a component of training programs to promote and sustain practice change.

In turn, credentialing and billing for the work of CHWs is hampered by widely variable regulation, conflicting job titles and position descriptions, and general confusion about CHW identity, sometimes complicated by service boundaries that overlap with those of other health care and social service occupations. This article presents evidence from a rapid review of the CHW literature from 2003 to 2018. It includes clinical trials, meta-analyses, and policy reports summarizing more than 200 CHW interventions intended to improve patient health status or care delivery. The evidence is used to identify CHW roles, responsibilities, behaviors, and competencies. Four categories of CHW practice are developed from the evidence: peer CHW, general CHW, clinical CHW, and health navigator. A framework is proposed to recognize unique CHW roles, promote and further integrate varied levels of CHW function into health care-related organizations, and to inform decisions regarding certification, education, and payment for CHW services in the United States. © 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Forty-two patients with mental illness took part in three participatory workshops. Data were analyzed through template analysis.Results:The findings indicated that a focus on the nuances and dynamics of clinical relationships would be beneficial. Specifically, the relationship considered most important to examine with respect to diversity education was the ""practitioner-self"" relationship.Discussion:Reconstructing the relationship-centered care model with the addition of the practitioner-self relationship may be better suited to theoretically informing future developments in diversity education. Further research is needed to understand what educational approaches contribute toward a relationship-centered care outlook and how relationship building behaviors, particularly those relevant to the practitioner-self relationship are best developed in diverse settings. © 2019 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067266236"

The Veterans Affairs South Central Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center was one of several centers of excellence established to address this need. It is also unique in that it focuses on rural and underserved veterans. This article summarizes the education accomplishments of the South Central Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center thus far in providing educational resources and trainings to frontline Veterans Affairs mental health staff with the goal of bringing best practices to routine clinical care, thus improving mental health services. We describe the use of implementation science to support dissemination of information, such as the monthly mental health grand rounds, especially for rural staff to receive continuing education, and the adoption of evidence-based psychotherapy trainings. The Clinical Educator Grants program allows clinicians to share their clinical expertise through development of practical tools for practice gaps they identify.

Interventions to improve culture-specific competencies in health care have been shown to be successful. However, there is an increasing demand for continuing professional development in general cross-cultural competencies that do not focus on specific cultures. Previous reviews do not differentiate between general cross-cultural and culturally specific competencies. This review assesses the effectiveness of interventions that aim to increase cross-cultural competencies in health professionals. Methods: Databases were searched systematically to identify quantitative and qualitative studies that focus on cross-cultural competencies in health care professions. Two independent raters used an assessment tool (Quality Assessment Tool for Studies with Diverse Designs, QATSDD) to rate the quality of the results. Results: Thirty-one of 34 identified studies described cross-cultural competency interventions to be effective in terms of participants' satisfaction with the interventions and self-rated knowledge improvement. Nineteen studies relied exclusively on subjective assessment methods. Most of them reported significant findings, whereas results from five studies with independent ratings or objective assessments were mostly not significant. Many studies lacked in providing sufficient data on intervention descriptions. Discussion: Cross-cultural competency interventions seem to be effective-according to self-ratings by participants. However, the definitions of cultural competency, the objectiveness of measurements, and the types of study outcomes were varied. To evaluate the success of cross-cultural competency interventions, more evidence from objective, behavioral assessments is needed. Studies should investigate the differential impact of various intervention types and need to provide detailed reporting on methods and outcomes.

One component of PEP is a monthly chart audit. The purpose of our study was to determine if physicians' charting skills improve through their participation in PEP. Methods: The sample included physicians who participated in PEP for at least 6 months regardless of specialization, age, or gender (n = 77). PEP chart audits evaluate seven different aspects of chart and care quality, including legibility, organization, history, assessment/formulation, treatment, physical examination, and overall chart quality. Each aspect of charting is scored on a Likerttype scale from a score of 1 to 9. We conducted pair-matched t tests of the mean item scores for the 1st versus 6th, 12th, 18th, and 24th month in PEP for all chart elements except legibility. We also compared the size of the paired differences by month 1 scores for overall chart quality mean score to determine if the magnitude of change varied by starting point. Results: There was significant improvement (P < .002) across the 6 chart quality elements per physician at months 6, 12, 18, and 24. Physicians who started below Q1 for overall chart quality mean showed most improvement, whereas those who started above Q3 had insignificant change as they had little room to improve. Discussion: PEP participants demonstrated improved charting skills for each chart quality element evaluated. PEP is an effective form of physician education resulting in physician behavior changes, especially for those physicians who need it the most. © 2018 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057573981"

Innovative programs, such as electronic consultations (eConsults), provide unique educational opportunities for practicebased needs assessment. The purpose of this study is to assess whether CPD offerings match the needs of physicians by coding and comparing session content to clinical questions asked through eConsults. Methods: This study analyzes questions asked by primary care providers between July 2011 and January 2015 using a service that allows specialists to provide consultation over a secure web-based server. The content of these questions was compared with the CPD courses offered in the area in which these primary care providers are practicing over a similar period (2012-2014). The clinical questions were categorized by the content area. The percentage of questions asked about each content area was calculated for each of the 12 specialties consulted. CPD course offerings were categorized using the same list of content areas. Percentage of minutes dedicated to each content area was calculated for each specialty. The percentage of questions asked and the percentage of CPD course minutes for each content area were compared. Results: There were numerous congruencies and discrepancies between the proportion of questions asked about a given content area and the CPD minutes dedicated to it. Discussion: Traditional needs assessment may underestimate the need to address topics that are frequently the subject of eConsults. Planners should recognize eConsult questions as a valuable source of practice-associated challenges that can identify professional development needs of physicians. © 2018 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education,and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053932977"

The model has expanded rapidly, with over 140 ECHO projects currently established globally. We have used validated implementation frameworks, such as Damschroder’s (2009) Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Proctor’s (2011) taxonomy of implementation outcomes, combined with implementation experience to (1) create a set of questions to assess organizational readiness and suitability of the ECHO model and (2) provide those who have determined ECHO is the correct model with a checklist to support successful implementation. A set of considerations was created, which adapted and consolidated CFIR constructs to create ECHO-specific organizational readiness questions, as well as a process guide for implementation. Each consideration was mapped onto Proctor’s (2011) implementation outcomes, and questions relating to the constructs were developed and reviewed for clarity. The Preimplementation list included 20 questions; most questions fall within Proctor’s (2001) implementation outcome domains of”Appropriateness“and”Acceptability.“The Process Checklist is a 26-item checklist to help launch an ECHO project; items map onto the constructs of Planning, Engaging, Executing, Reflecting, and Evaluating. Given that fidelity to the ECHO model is associated with robust outcomes, effective implementation is critical. These tools will enable programs to work through key considerations to implement a successful Project ECHO. Next steps will include validation with a diverse sample of ECHO projects.

TEL includes hardware, such as computers and mobile devices, and software, such as software applications (apps), learning management systems, and discussion boards. For many years, TEL has formed an integral part of health professional programs and is growing in acceptance, if not expectation, in postgraduate training and continuing education. TEL generally aims to be flexible, engaging, learner focused and interactive, and may involve collaboration and communication. It offers many benefits for learning and teaching, whether used on its own or in conjunction with face-to-face teaching through blended learning. The ubiquity of mobile devices in clinical settings means TEL is ideal for busy clinicians, both as learners and teachers. TEL enables participants to learn at a time and place that is convenient to them, so learners living in geographically dispersed locations can access standardized courses. To realize these potential benefits, we recommend that those developing TEL programs for health professionals take a systematic approach to planning, development, implementation, and evaluation. To that end, we propose 10 principles: clarify purpose and conduct a needs assessment; allocate adequate time and technology; incorporate proven approaches to improve learning; consider the need for a skills component; enable interaction between learners and with others; create different resources for different groups; pilot before implementing; incorporate measures to retain learners; provide opportunities for revision to aid retention; and evaluate learning outcomes, not just satisfaction. © 2017 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034953248"

However, this approach is new to evaluating the continuing professional development (CPD) of other health care practitioners such as audiology, speech-language therapy, occupational therapy, and physiotherapy in low- and middle-income countries. This study explored the use of Personal Commitment (to change) Statements (PCSs) as an evaluation tool of continuing education for health professionals in low- and middle-income countries, and its impact on the integration of new knowledge and skills with previous knowledge and clinical practice.Methods:PCSs were used in a case study conducted at a 1-day interprofessional CPD event held for health practitioners in South Africa. A qualitative thematic analysis was made of these PCSs, and results were synthesized into main themes.Results:Thirty-two participants turned in a PCS at the end of the CPD event with a total of 71 text statements. Three main domains were identified: (1) applying new knowledge in practice (61.97%); (2) increasing training-related content knowledge (21.12%); and (3) sharing information, skill, and resources (16.9%).Discussion:This study demonstrated that personal commitment statements can be used to describe the outcomes of CPD events for audiologists, speech-language, occupational, and physiotherapists. Participants engaged in reflection generated by the personal commitment statement, which contained no guiding statements, yet elicited responses showing that participants were more aware of the assessment tools and how they could use them in practice. Further study is warranted into the process and the role of follow-up regarding health practitioners' commitment to change in clinical practice. © 2019 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067291798"

Although Program Coordinators (PCs) play an integral role in residency training programs, there exist few, if any, interventions aimed at addressing their burnout. Methods: A longitudinal study design was used to evaluate data from residency/fellowship training PCs who participated in a wellness retreat held at a single institution in August 2016. Subjects completed anonymous, pre- and post-retreat questionnaires in addition to a 3-month follow-up questionnaire, which included questions used to assess aspects of job demand, resiliency, and well-being. The seven-item Physician Well-Being Index and a logistic regression model were used to assess well-being. Mean values and SDs were reported to examine changes in mental health scores and participants' job satisfaction over the course of the intervention. Results: Nineteen of the 45 (43%) invited residency/fellowship training PCs completed data collection. Coordinators ranged in age from 25 to 64 years; all were female. Well-being, sleep, resiliency, and employee satisfaction scores improved over the assessment period. Well-being scores initially decreased by 0.37 at the postassessment, but increased at follow-up (mean: 2.0; SD 1.7). Stress scores increased from baseline to post, but decreased from baseline to follow-up: 0.2 and 20.2, respectively. Discussion: Residency PCs experienced improvements in mental quality of life, resiliency, stress, and sleep scores on attending the wellness program. Attention to such findings may have important implications, as we address the burnout crisis in the medical education community.

Research shows that professionals are more proactive in learning and knowledge sharing with peers in teams with more psychological safety. Psychological safety has however not been studied in relation to peers' performance feedback. This study investigated the association between physicians' perceptions of psychological safety and performance feedback received from their peers. Methods: We invited physicians of cardiology, gastroenterology, obstetrics and gynecology, otorhinolaryngology, pulmonology, neurology, and neurosurgery departments of an academic medical center to participate. Physicians evaluated psychological safety using Edmondson's seven-item validated scale and performance feedback using the adapted four-item feedback subscale of the validated System for Evaluation of Teaching Qualities, including corrective and positive feedback, explanations of feedback, and suggestions for improvement from peers. We analyzed the data using multilevel linear regression analyses adjusted for physicians' sex, years since being certified a medical specialist, and months working in the clinic under the study. Results: This study included 105 physicians (86.8% participated). Psychological safety was positively associated with physicians' perceptions of performance feedback from peers (B = 0.54, 95% confidence interval = 0.34-0.73, P-Value <.001). Conclusions: Physicians who experienced more psychological safety were more likely to receive corrective and positive performance feedback from peers, explanations of feedback, and suggestions for improvement. Medical teams should consider investing in psychological safety to encourage performance feedback from peers, and thus support physicians' continuous professional development and their efforts to provide high-quality patient care. © 2018 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057518586"

Rather than train and educate in professional silos, interprofessional education presented an opportunity to reframe continuing education (CE) to improve the integration of care delivery and outcomes. Methods: In April 2014, two regional AHECs collaborated to design a statewide initiative for AHEC CE leaders, CE professionals, and CE faculty to learn about integrating interprofessional education into CE planning and implementation. The design of this innovative initiative develops a common knowledge base in CIPE, promotes collaboration, avoids duplication, and creates shared definitions and standards to advance CIPE across the NC AHEC program. Results: The NC AHEC CIPE Initiative drew participation from CE leaders, CE professionals, and CE faculty. Immediately after the completion of the Initiative, seven AHECs completed CIPE events. By June 2017, AHECs across the state had offered a total of 36 CIPE events. Discussion: The NC AHEC CIPE Initiative demonstrates that it is possible to implement CIPE programming in a regional CE context. The education model promoted changes in knowledge, competence, and performance of CE professionals and faculty. Critical success factors include leadership support, functioning as a community of practice, engaging experts to train CE professionals and faculty, and using technology to span geographic distance of learners. © 2018 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064119931"

Beauchamp and James F. Childress' (B&C) book Principles of Biomedical Ethics is well known for its four-principle approach to biomedical ethics. However, the authors also emphasize the importance of the virtues of health care personnel. After a short overview of virtue ethics, the five ""focal virtues"" described by B&C are discussed and applied to a chronic pain example. The question of how virtues are learned in the health care setting is addressed, and it is argued that virtues such as the ones defended by B&C are acquired when health care personnel are socialized in an environment dedicated to the continuous upholding of practices that aim at the telos of medicine. Viewed from this perspective, professional isolation can be considered to be dangerous; the upholding of medical professionalism throughout a whole career largely presupposing the existence of a community where virtues relevant to the practice of medicine are embodied and kept alive. The concept of professional socialization is important in that respect. Finally, some potential general implications of this view for continuing professional development are proposed. © 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Lifelong learning (LLL), linked with quality improvement, competence, and professionalism, is a core competency in medical education. The purpose of this study is to examine cultural factors (individual, organizational, and systemic) that influence CPD and specifically the use of clinical data to inform LLL and CPD activities. This mixed-method study will examine the perceptions of two learner groups (psychiatrists and general surgeons) in three phases: (1) a survey to understand the relationship between data-informed learning and orientation to LLL; (2) semistructured interviews using purposive and maximum variation sampling techniques to identify individual-,organizational-, and system-level barriers and facilitators to engaging in data-informed LLL to support practice change; and (3) a document analysis of legislation, policies, and procedures related to the access and the use of clinical data for performance improvement in CPD. We obtained research ethics approval from the University Health Network in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. By exploring two distinct learner groups, we will identify contextual features that may inform what educators should consider when conceptualizing and designing CPD activities and what initial actions need to be taken before CPD activities can be optimized. This study will lead to the development of a framework reflective of barriers and facilitators that can be implemented when planning to use data in CPD activities to support data adoption for LLL. © 2018 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057568689"

In step 3, 440 health care professionals (from 27 health care teams) participated in single-session, 1-hour training that covered the psychological impact of injury- and illness-related trauma, identification of traumatic stress symptoms, and how to respond to children exposed to potentially traumatic events. A concomitant quality improvement project allowed us to assess potential changes in training participants' favorable attitudes toward the integration of TIC and confidence in delivering TIC.Results:Compared with pretraining, participants demonstrated increases in attitude toward TIC, t(293) = 5.8, P <.001, Cohen's d = 0.32, and confidence in delivering TIC, t(293) = 20.9, P <.001, Cohen's d = 1.09.Discussion:Trainings were effective in achieving proximal goals targeting attitudes and confidence, thereby demonstrating the feasibility and clinical relevance of TIC training when implemented according to the three-step framework. Future research should examine methods of training to reach wide audiences to promote systematic change and evaluate changes in patient outcomes associated with providers' implementation of TIC. © 2017 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043318110"

Little is published on simulation-based education in the context of continuing pharmacy education (CPE) of pharmacists. This article describes the development implementation and evaluation of simulation-based workshop to train hospital pharmacists on medicines reconciliation in Kuwait. The study aimed to explore pharmacists' perceptions about simulation use in CPE. It also assessed the impact of the workshops on pharmacists' attitudes toward, knowledge, and comfort level to apply medicines reconciliation. Methods: One hundred ten pharmacists attended 11 simulation-based workshops. Data were collected using focus groups and self-administered surveys in a mixed-method research design. Focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed for content. Descriptive statistics were used to report surveys' findings. Results: The workshops were well-received by pharmacists. Few pharmacists recalled previous exposure to simulation in CPE activities. Pharmacists' perceived challenges to simulation integration into their professional training were the need for good preparation/setting, qualified faculty, well-trained simulated patients, and time constrains. Participants felt that simulation enhanced their attitudes toward, knowledge, and comfort level to apply medicines reconciliation. They rated their knowledge level as having increased by 62.3% and comfort level as having increased by 37.0%. They overwhelmingly welcomed more integration of simulation in CPE activities. Discussion: A simulation-based continuing education workshop was well-received by pharmacists and enhanced their selfreported knowledge, comfort level, and preparedness to apply medicines reconciliation. Efforts are needed to expand simulation use in the development, refinement, and maintenance of clinical skills of pharmacists throughout their educational continuum including CPE.  © 2019 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071713086"

The purpose of this study was to identify how expert faculty translates knowledge, so that PCPs can act on it. Methods: One hundred ninety-seven PCPs from 82 practices in 14 states attended at least one Project ECHO Chronic Pain session over 10 months, hosted by a large federally qualified health center. Expert faculty was a multidisciplinary panel of six clinicians. Recommendations for 25 randomly selected case presentations were transcribed, yielding 406 discrete units of data. A thematic analysis contributed to a concept map for knowledge translation. Results: Expert faculty addressed psychosocial issues in 40% of recommendations. Three themes represented a familiar clinical decision-making process: recommendations for treatment accounted for risk factors and patient engagement and behavior. A concept map placed the recommendations for selected cases in the first phase of the action cycle in the Knowledge-to-Action framework, where knowledge is shared but not yet acted on. Discussion: Project ECHO Chronic Pain is an example of iterative guided practice, wherein expert faculty use published guidelines and professional experience to make recommendations for patient care to PCPs. This occurs using shared social- cultural-historical language and context consistent with social constructivist theories of learning.  © 2019 The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071711501"

However, their use has achieved mixed success, and multiple personal and contextual factors can influence their impacts on practice change. The aim of this study was to identify which factors influence the acceptability and perceived impacts of an ePortfolio implemented by an occupational therapy regulatory organization in one Canadian province. Method: A cross-sectional online survey design was used. The survey was sent to registered occupational therapists in Quebec. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to identify factors influencing acceptability and outcomes: ease of use, satisfaction, impact on implementation of the CPD plan, and competence improvement. Results: The survey was fully completed by 546 participants. Factors significantly influencing the ePortfolio acceptability and perceived impacts were attitude toward and familiarity with the portfolio, confidence in reflective skills, engagement in the CPD plan, and desire for feedback. Time spent completing the ePortfolio and the fact of completing it in teams were negatively associated with the outcomes. Discussion: Shaping more favorable user attitudes, helping users recognize and experience the tool's benefits for their practice, and fostering confidence in their reflective skills are important factors that can be addressed to improve ePortfolio acceptability and outcomes. Contextual factors, such as time spent completing the ePortfolio and completing it in teams, seem to reflect greater difficulty with using the tool. Study findings can contribute to improving ePortfolio implementation in the CPD context. © 2018 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education,and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053874397"

Limited empiric research has been performed to characterize clinical excellence in hospital medicine. We conducted a qualitative study to discover elements judged to be most pertinent to excellence in clinical care delivered by hospitalists.Methods:The chiefs of hospital medicine at five hospitals were asked to identify their ""clinically best"" hospitalists. Data collection, in the form of one-on-one interviews, was directed by an interview guide. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and the informants' perspectives were analyzed using editing analysis to identify themes.Results:A total of 26 hospitalists were interviewed. The mean age of the physicians was 38 years, 13 (50%) were women, and 16 (62%) were non-white. Seven themes emerged that related to clinical excellence in hospital medicine: communicating effectively, appreciating partnerships and collaboration, having superior clinical judgment, being organized and efficient, connecting with patients, committing to continued growth and development, and being professional and humanistic.Discussion:This qualitative study describes how respected hospitalists think about excellence in clinical care in hospital medicine. Their perspectives can be used to guide continuing medical education, so that offered programs can pay attention to enhancing the skills of learners so they can develop towards excellence, rather than using only competence as the desired target objective. © 2017 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043345915"

The majority of such information at meetings is presented through abstract sessions. However, the quality of the evidence presented during such abstract sessions is unclear. Standardized measures were applied to assess the quality of evidence of abstracts presented at the Canadian Society of Nephrology AGM over a 5-year period.Methods:Two authors independently reviewed all CSN AGM abstracts presented from 2012 to 2016. Using a schema published in 2011 by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM), each abstract was subsequently ranked based on the quality of evidence. Schema categories ranged from level I, representing the highest evidence quality, to level V, representing the lowest. The number of authors and the authors' institution affiliations were also collected from the abstracts, where available, or if affiliations were unclear, an internet search of the author was performed.Results:Six hundred forty-two articles were screened. In total, 70% (n = 450) met the inclusion criteria. When assessed, 15% of articles were level I (highest quality), 17% level II, 53% level III, 12% level IV, and 3% level V (lowest quality). A Jonckheere-Terpstra test demonstrated a significant trend of increasing quality of evidence (P <.05) and collaboration (P <.005) over the 5-year study period. There was a significant correlation between level of evidence and collaboration across years reviewed in the study, rs(98) = -0.226, P <.001.Discussion:The results indicate a consistent increase in quality of evidence and collaborative submissions over time. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first assessment and analysis of AGM presentation quality within internal medicine and its subspecialties. Documenting and monitoring changes in the quality of evidence with a standardized framework may offer valuable insight pertaining to the medical field and the research community. © 2019 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067266614"

While widely used in student training and assessment of communication and clinical examination across health disciplines, little is known how SPs enhance knowledge or skill development among professionals. We conducted a systematic review to determine the effectiveness of SPs in continuing medical education (CME) programs. Methods: Authors independently searched for studies published between 1966 and 2016, describing CME initiatives using SP encounters as practice for participants compared with those which did not. Studies assessing virtual patients or mannequins or employing SPs for assessment only were excluded. Learning outcomes were characterized according to the Kirkpatrick framework for determining the effectiveness of training programs. Results: Four hundred eighty-eight studies were identified, but only five were eligible for analysis. Most were conducted with small numbers of primary care physicians in North America. CME topics related to opioid prescribing, breast cancer examination and cancer screening, smoking cessation, and chronic asthma management. In the two studies testing knowledge, no difference was found between intervention and control groups (Kirkpatrick level 2). Improved behaviors were demonstrated in breast cancer patient examination and interview and decreased opioid-prescribing rates among selected participants in two studies (Kirkpatrick level 3). Only one study investigated patient outcomes and found reduced rates of uncontrolled asthma in practices of physicians who were assigned to SP practice encounters in the CME training (Kirkpatrick level 4). Discussion: There is little rigorous outcome study of CME programs incorporating SPs. Given the necessary human and fiscal resources associated with their use, our review highlights the need to reconsider the SP role in CME unless further purposeful evaluation to determine participant behavior change and related patient outcomes is pursued. © 2018 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education,and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053940426"

Our aim was to compare the extent of gender imbalance in the leadership of the top 100 medical schools and to critically analyze the contributing factors through a comprehensive theoretical framework.Methods:We adopted the theoretical framework of the Systems and Career Influences Model. The leadership was classified into four tiers of leadership hierarchy. Variables of interest included gender, h-index, number of documents published, total number of citations, and number of years in active research. A total of 2448 (77.59%) men and 707 (22.41%) women met the inclusion criteria.Results:Male majority was found in all regions with a significant difference in all levels of leadership (chi square = 91.66; P value =.001). Women had a lower mean h-index across all positions in all regions, and when we adjusted for number of years invested, M Index for women was still significantly lower than men (T test = 6.52; P value =.02).Discussion:Organizational and individual influences are transcontinental within the top 100 medical school leadership hierarchy.

However, few departmental continuing medical education/graduate medical education (CME/GME) conferences, such as Grand Rounds (GR), have adopted these techniques. The purpose of this study was to describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of Friday Forum (FF), a weekly CME/GME conference that incorporated active learning and sequencing techniques into a new educational offering, complementary to GR, within a medium-sized academic pediatrics department.Methods:Implemented in 2013, FF was designed to address 5 medically relevant themes in a sequential, rotating, interactive format, and included: (1) clinical reasoning, (2) evidence-based medicine, (3) morbidity & mortality, (4) research in progress, and (5) ethics. In 2018, at the conclusion of its fifth year, a survey and focus groups of faculty, residents, and fellows explored the relative value of FF compared with the departmental GR.Results:Survey response rates for residents/fellows and faculty were 37/76 (48.7%) and 57/112 (50.9%), respectively. FF was rated highly for helping participants develop rapport with colleagues, exposing participants to interactive strategies for large-group teaching and value for time spent. GR was rated highly for helping participants learn about academic endeavors outside the department and emerging challenges in pediatrics. Qualitatively, two key themes emerged for FF: desire for interaction (community building) and topical variety.Discussion:Using active learning and sequencing techniques, we implemented a novel CME/GME conference that enhanced our learning community by integrating the education of faculty and trainees, and achieved complementary objectives to GR. © 2019 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067268872"

Many of these evaluations assume that if the intended changes occur, the result represents an improvement. However, given the systemic nature of clinical practice, a change in one area can produce changes in other areas as well, some of which may adversely affect the patient. Balancing measures are used to determine whether unintended consequences of an intervention have been introduced into other areas of the system. The aims of this study were to evaluate the impact of behavior change intervention-based continuing professional development (CPD) on pharmacist interventions (resolution of drug therapy problems-DTPs) and resolution of quality indicator DTPs and knowledge change for urinary tract infections (UTI) and pneumonia. As a balancing measure, we aimed to determine whether delivery of behavior change interventions targeting pneumonia and UTI practice results in a negative impact on other important pharmacist interventions, specifically the resolution of heart failure DTPs.; METHODS: A quasiexperimental study was conducted at a Canadian health authority that evaluated the impacts of an 8-week multifaceted behavior change intervention delivered to 58 ward-based pharmacists. The primary outcome was change in proportion of UTI and pneumonia DTPs resolved from the 6-month preintervention to 6-month postintervention phase. Secondary outcomes were changes in proportion of UTI and pneumonia quality indicator DTPs resolved, knowledge quiz scores, and proportion of quality indicator DTPs resolved for heart failure as a balancing measure.; RESULTS: A total of 58 pharmacists were targets of the intervention. The proportion of resolved UTI and pneumonia DTPs increased from 17.8 to 27.2% (relative risk increase 52.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 42.8-63.6%; P < 0.05). The proportion of resolved UTI and pneumonia quality indicator DTPs increased from 12.2% to 18.2% (relative risk increase 49.9%, 95% CI 34.5-67.0%; P < 0.05). Resolved heart failure DTPs decreased from 14.3 to 8.5% (RRR 40.4%, 95% CI 33.9-46.2%; P < 0.05). Thirty-six pharmacists completed the pre- and post-quiz. Scores increased from 11.3/20 ± 3.2/20 to 14.8/20 ± 2.9/20 (P < 0.05).; DISCUSSION: CPD using a multifaceted behavior change intervention improved pharmacist behavior and knowledge for UTI and pneumonia. However, these improvements may be offset by reduced interventions for other disease states, such as heart failure. Strategies to mitigate the unintended effects on other professional behaviors should be implemented when delivering CPD focused on changing one aspect of professional behavior.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052706482"

Focusing on professional lapses to identify and remediate unprofessional physicians is incomplete. We explored professionalism in practicing internal medicine physicians in the context of everyday practice, to highlight how typical experiences contribute to positive, yet often unnoticed, professional behavior. Methods: In-depth interviews were used to uncover 13 physicians’ most meaningful experiences of professionalism. Data were collected and analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Results: Results revealed several themes around which physicians embody professionalism in their daily lives. Physicians feel most professional when they are able to connect and establish trust with patients and colleagues and when they serve as positive role models to others. Physicians conceptualize professionalism as a dynamic and evolving competency, one that requires a lifelong commitment and that provides opportunities for lifelong learning. Discussion: Focusing on actual perceptions of experiences in practice offers important insights into how physicians think about professionalism beyond a traditional remediation and lapses perspective. Physicians often go out of their way to connect with patients and colleagues, serving and modeling for others, often at the expense of their own work-life balance. These moments help to infuse energy and positivity into physician practices during a time when physicians may feel overburdened, overscheduled, and overregulated. Understanding professionalism as developmental helps frame professionalism as a lifelong competency subject to growth and modification over time.

This has created the need for QI training at all levels of health professional education. A reported barrier to increasing QItrained health care professionals is the lack of QI-trained faculty at health care institutions and the limited availability of practitioners, given their daily clinical demands. E-learning is a potential solution. E-learning allows learning outside the traditional classroom setting, where instructors can flexibly deliver practical QI curricula to an interprofessional audience in multiple practice locations.

The ""INviting Co-workers to Evaluate Physicians Tool"" (INCEPT) is a multisource feedback instrument used to evaluate physicians' professional performance as perceived by peers, residents, and coworkers. In this study, we report on the validity, reliability, and feasibility of the INCEPT.Methods:The performance of 218 physicians was assessed by 597 peers, 344 residents, and 822 coworkers. Using explorative and confirmatory factor analyses, multilevel regression analyses between narrative and numerical feedback, item-total correlations, interscale correlations, Cronbach's α and generalizability analyses, the psychometric qualities, and feasibility of the INCEPT were investigated.Results:For all respondent groups, three factors were identified, although constructed slightly different: ""professional attitude,"" ""patient-centeredness,"" and ""organization and (self)-management."" Internal consistency was high for all constructs (Cronbach's α ≥ 0.84 and item-total correlations ≥ 0.52). Confirmatory factor analyses indicated acceptable to good fit. Further validity evidence was given by the associations between narrative and numerical feedback. For reliable total INCEPT scores, three peer, two resident and three coworker evaluations were needed; for subscale scores, evaluations of three peers, three residents and three to four coworkers were sufficient.Discussion:The INCEPT instrument provides physicians performance feedback in a valid and reliable way. The number of evaluations to establish reliable scores is achievable in a regular clinical department. When interpreting feedback, physicians should consider that respondent groups' perceptions differ as indicated by the different item clustering per performance factor. © 2017 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029698852"

The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility, effectiveness, and sustainability of an MSF process that includes a telephone/videoconference debrief, to better design future MSF implementation.Method:Thirty-seven Australasian physician participants sought feedback from patients and colleagues and debriefed their feedback report with a trained facilitator. The impact was evaluated using quantitative and qualitative measures including surveys and semistructured interviews.Results:The feasibility of the MSF process was impacted by the level of support for the participant to complete the MSF, the nature and location of participants' work, and the use of telephone/videoconference to deliver the debrief. Regarding effectiveness, the MSF stimulated reflection on practice and action on areas identified for improvement. In addition, the quality of rater feedback and the inclusion of a debrief impacted participant and facilitator reports of effectiveness. The absence of a culture of feedback, the formative nature of the MSF, and the confidentiality of the results were factors impacting sustainability.Discussion:Optimizing MSF is important to encourage broad uptake in the wider medical community in Australasia. Although several factors were identified as having an impact, it is clear that inclusion of a quality debrief will increase the perceived value and the effectiveness of MSF. Delivering that debrief through telephone/videoconference can be effective and will increase the overall feasibility and sustainability. © 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The purpose of this study is to synthesize the results from existing reviews to provide a holistic overview of the validity evidence. Methods: This review identified eight systematic reviews evaluating the validity of MSF published between January 2006 and October 2016. Using a standardized data extraction form, two independent reviewers extracted study characteristics. A framework of validation developed by the American Psychological Association was used to appraise the validity evidence within each systematic review. Results: In terms of validity evidence, each of the eight reviews demonstrated evidence across at least one domain of the American Psychological Association's validity framework. Evidence of assessment validity within the domains of ""internal structure"" and ""relationship to other variables"" has been well established. However, the domains of content validity (ie, ensuring that MSF tools measure what they are intended to measure); consequential validity (ie, evidence of the intended or unintended consequences MSF assessments may have on participants or wider society), and response process validity (ie, the process of standardization and quality control in the delivery and completion of assessments) remain limited. Discussion: Evidence for the validity of MSF has, across a number of domains, been well established. However, the size and quality of the existing evidence remains variable. To determine the extent to which MSF is considered a valid instrument to assess medical performance, future research is required to determine the following: (1) how best to design and deliver MSF assessments that address the identified limitations of existing tools and (2) how to ensure that involvement within MSF supports positive changes in practice. Such research is integral if MSF is to continue to inform medical performance and subsequent improvements in the quality and safety of patient care. © 2018 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057562240"

For behavior change to occur, participants often need to consciously reject previous ideas and transform their way of thinking. Transformational learning is a process that cultivates deep emotional responses and can lead to cognitive and behavioral change in learners, potentially facilitating rich learning experiences and expediting knowledge translation. We explored participants’ experiences at a 2-day conference designed to support transformative learning as they encounter new concepts within Information Mastery, which challenge their previous frameworks around the topic of medical decision making. Using the lens of transformative learning theory, we asked: how does Information Mastery qualitatively promote perspective transformation and hence behavior change? Methods: We used a hermeneutic phenomenologic approach to capture the lived experience of 12 current and nine previous attendees of the “Information Mastery” course through individual interviews, focus groups, and observation. Data were thematically analyzed. Results: Both prevoius and current conference attendees described how the delivery of new concepts about medical decision making evoked strong emotional responses, facilitated personal transformation, and propelled expedited behavior change around epistemological, moral, and information management themes, resulting in a newfound sense of self-efficacy, confidence, and ownership in their ability to make medical decisions. Discussion: When the topic area holds the potential to foster a qualitative reframing of learners’ guiding paradigms and worldviews, attention should be paid to supporting learners’ personalized meaning-making process through transformative learning opportunities to promote translation into practice.

However, research on self-directed learning in an era of growing digital technology utilization is underdeveloped. This study explored the adoption and use of mobile learning as a continuing professional development (CPD) activity.Methods:A mixed-methods case study using semistructured interviews and a web-based questionnaire was conducted with health and human services professionals in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.Results:Respondents reported using a smartphone (53.8%), tablets (50.4%), YouTube (43.0%), and mobile apps (35.8%) for CPD. The highest-rated benefits of mobile learning included improved access to information (M = 3.51); potential for enhanced knowledge acquisition (M = 3.45); staying up to date (M = 3.44); and verifying information (M = 3.40). The greatest barriers included cost of some apps and resources (M = 3.07); websites/programs not functional on mobile devices (M = 2.84); workplace barriers preventing access to digital resources (M = 2.82); and social media use linked to negative perceptions of professionalism (M = 2.65). Interview respondents described the flexibility and convenience of mobile learning, the level of autonomy it offered, and the advantages of learning on their own time.

This included numeric rating scales and free text comments. Basic statistical rankings, template-based automated coding, and emergent coding were used to analyze SAM experience and identify thematic content.; RESULTS: Across SAMs, numeric ratings were universally high and positive free text comments outnumbered negative comments two to one. When comparing feedback on the knowledge assessment and clinical simulation (CS) activities, SAMs were rated less favorably when the frequency of ideas identified by participants as most prevalent in one activity mismatched those identified as most prevalent in the companion activity. Participants were also critical of navigation issues, technical issues, and a lack of realness in the CS activity.; DISCUSSION: Whether analyzed through quantitative data, qualitative data, or mixed methods, a large majority of participants rated their experience with SAMs highly. When individual SAMs were rated poorly, it seemed to be due to discordance in ideas emphasized between the knowledge assessment and CS components, or an opinion regarding the SAM topic that existed independent of the SAM process.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053300288"

Motivation may play an integral role in many of the challenges facing the physician workforce today including maintenance of a high performance. The aim of this study was to determine whether medical specialists show different motivational profiles and if these profiles predict differences in motivation for lifelong learning. Methods: An online questionnaire was sent to every medical specialist working in five hospitals in the Netherlands. The questionnaire included the validated Multidimensional Work Motivation Scale and the Jefferson Scale of Physician Lifelong Learning together with background questions like age, gender, and type of hospital. Respondents were grouped into different motivational profiles by using a two-step clustering approach. Results: Four motivational profiles were identified: (1) HAMC profile (for High Autonomous and Moderate Controlled motivation), (2) MAMC profile (for Moderate Autonomous and Moderate Controlled motivation), (3) MALC profile (for Moderate Autonomous and Low Controlled motivation), and (4) HALC profile (for High Autonomous and Low Controlled motivation). Most of the female specialists that work in an academic hospital and specialists with a surgical specialty were represented in the HALC profile. Discussion: Four motivational profiles were found among medical specialists, differing in gender, experience and type of specialization. The profiles are based on the combination of autonomous motivation (AM) and controlled motivation (CM) in the specialists. The profiles that have a high score on autonomous motivation have a positive association with lifelong learning. Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056502056"

Although there are several treatment options for prenatal depression, many depressed women remain untreated. This study tested the effects of a low-intensity online training module on providers' attitudes, beliefs, and management practices of prenatal depression across a diverse group of providers. Methods: Health care providers who were providing care to pregnant women completed a 64-item survey consisting of items from the Management of Maternal Depression Inventory. Upon completion of the survey, providers were randomized into the intervention or the active control arm (wait-listed). The intervention consisted of an online training, which targeted knowledge and skills related to providing guidance on prenatal mood disorders. Approximately 6 to 8 weeks after randomization, all providers completed the survey again, and a general linear model framework was used to test change from baseline. Results: The final sample was comprised 74 compliant providers (intervention arm: n = 41; control arm: n = 33). Providers in the intervention arm reported significant increases in the sense of responsibility and self-efficacy when compared with their counterparts in the active control arm (all P < .001). Providers in the intervention arm also reported an increase in satisfaction related to communication with mental health specialists when compared with their counterparts in the active control arm (P = .05). Discussion: Our findings suggest that a brief, online training improved the attitudes, confidence, and communication of diverse providers related to the management of prenatal depression. Provider online training may help encourage patient-provider dialogue and in turn, enhance the management of prenatal depression.  © 2019 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071631422"

This article reports on knowledge gained and perceptions changed among 24 skilled nursing facility health workers who completed Teepa Snow's innovative Positive Approach to Care Certification course as a regional initiative. Methods: This pilot study used a quasi-experiment with a one-group pretest-posttest design to assess the dementia knowledge and perceptions of health workers who participated in the course. Paired responses (n = 22) for the 54-item dementia knowledge and training/coaching perceptions survey were compared using the McNemar test, Paired t test, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test to analyze the improvement in knowledge and perceptions of dementia. Results: Significant knowledge gain was found among health workers after completing the program (t(21) = 27.46, P < .001). Statistical differences (P < .05) were present in eight knowledge items (ie, working memory, mental health, temporal lobe, “sapphire”, “space and awareness”, personal space, binocular vision, and hippocampus) and four perception areas (ie, approaching, understanding, calming, and instructing) about dementia. Significant changes were also found in four areas of health workers' perceptions about dementia (P < .05). Discussion: The certification course can improve knowledge and facilitate perceptual change on dementia. Implementing this program as a novel regional initiative has robust potential in ensuring continuing workforce development in health care settings challenged with ever-changing people living with dementia needs and high staff turnover.

However, there is evidence that longer lectures can lead to both decreased attention and retention of information. The authors sought to identify trends in lecture duration, lecture types, and number of speakers at four national emergency medicine (EM) conferences over a 6-year period.Methods:The authors performed a retrospective analysis of the length, number of speakers, and format of didactic lectures at four different national EM conferences over 6 years. The authors abstracted data from the national academic assemblies for the four largest not-for-profit EM organizations in the United States: American Academy of Emergency Medicine, American College of Emergency Physicians, Council of Emergency Medicine Residency Directors, and Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.Results:There was a significant yearly decrease in the mean lecture lengths for three of the four conferences. There was an increase in the percentage of rapid fire sessions over the preceding 2 years with a corresponding decrease in the percentage of general educational sessions. There was no significant difference in the mean number of speakers per lecture.Discussion:An analysis of 4210 didactic lecture sessions from the annual meetings of four national EM organizations over a 6-year period showed significant decreases in mean lecture length.

Opportunities for professional staff to grow and network through attendance at national meetings and to share best practices are limited. We sought to describe a community of practice established to enhance the professional development of faculty affairs professionals and to document its impact. Methods: We outlined the process of formation of the New England Network for Faculty Affairs (NENFA), reviewed the pedagogical approaches to professional development, and surveyed members to evaluate the impact of NENFA on their activities, professional network and their institutions. Results: After a successful 2011 initial meeting, NENFA created an organizing committee and conducted a needs assessment among potential members. NENFA's charter, mission, goals, and structure were based on survey results. NENFA's regional community of practice grew to 31 institutions and held 10 meetings over 5 years. Meetings have examined a faculty development topic in depth using multiple learning formats to engage participants from academic medical centers and allied professions. Results from a 2015 member survey confirmed the value of NENFA. Multiple members documented changes in practice as a result of participating. Discussion: NENFA has been sustained by volunteer leadership, collaboration, and the value that the group has brought to its members. We propose that a ""community of practice"" offers an effective model for collaborative learning among individuals at different institutions within a competitive health care environment. We recommend that the approach be replicated in other regions. © 2018 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education,and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053918915"

However, empirical evidence presenting the use of collegial feedback to develop health professionals’ competence in clinical settings seems to be scarce. The aim of this study was to explore health professionals’ experiences of observing each other as critical friends in a clinical setting, as part of a continuous professional development initiative. Methods: The study was designed as a qualitative inductive study. Reflective journals written by health professionals (n = 57) were analyzed using thematic networks. The health professionals represented registered nurses and registered nurses with different specialist education (eg, in pediatrics, mental health, intensive care, and anesthesiology), biomedical scientists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, and dental hygienists. Results: Health professionals can successfully use collegial feedback and benefit from critical friendships in clinical settings as it offers ample opportunities for reflection before, during, and after the observation. A key finding was that to incorporate changes to professional practice, each individual needs to not only act as a critical friend but also experience being observed by a critical friend. Discussion: Based on the results of this study, it seems worthwhile to implement and further develop opportunities for health professionals to act as critical friends. We suggest that future research explore not only how professional competence develops over time but also how it impacts on health-related outcomes for patients.

Hence, the need and importance of training quality for HPC professionals are growing. This study evaluated the construct validity and reliability of the Evaluation Indicators for standard Hospice and Palliative Care Training (EIHPCT) program.Methods:As a framework to develop evaluation indicators, an invented theoretical model combining Stufflebeam's CIPP (Context-Input-Process-Product) evaluation model with PRECEDE-PROCEED model was used. To verify the construct validity of the EIHPCT program, a structured survey was performed with 169 professionals who were the HPC training program administrators, trainers, and trainees. To examine the validity of the areas of the EIHPCT program, exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were conducted.Results:First, in the exploratory factor analysis, the indicators with factor loadings above 0.4 were chosen as desirable items, and some cross-loaded items that loaded at 0.4 or higher on two or more factors were adjusted as the higher factor. Second, the model fit of the modified EIHPCT program was quite good in the confirmatory factor analysis (Goodness-of-Fit Index > 0.70, Comparative Fit Index > 0.80, Normed Fit Index > 0.80, Root Mean square of Residuals < 0.05). The modified model of the EIHPCT comprised 4 areas, 13 subdomains, and 61 indicators.Discussion:The evaluation indicators of the modified model will be valuable references for improving the HPC professional training program. © 2017 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042879370"

Little attention has been paid to wording of requests for comments, potentially limiting its utility to support physician performance. This study tested the phrasing of two different sets of questions. Methods: Two sets of questions were tested with family physicians, medical and surgical specialists, and their medical colleague and coworker respondents. One set asked respondents to identify one thing the participant physician does well and one thing the physician could target for action. Set 2 questions asked what does the physician do well and what might the physician do to enhance practice. Resulting free-text comments provided by respondents were coded for polarity (positive, neutral, or negative), specificity (precision and detail), actionability (ability to use the feedback to direct future activity), and CanMEDS roles (competencies) and analyzed descriptively. Results: Data for 222 physicians (111 physicians per set) were analyzed. A total of 1824 comments (8.2/physician) were submitted, with more comments from coworkers than medical colleagues. Set 1 yielded more comments and were more likely to be positive, semi specific, and very actionable than set 2. However, set 2 generated more very specific comments. Comments covered all CanMEDS roles with more comments for collaborator and leader roles. Discussion: The wording of questions inviting free-text responses influences the volume and nature of the comments provided. Individuals designing multisource feedback tools should carefully consider wording of items soliciting narrative responses. © 2018 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education,and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053919208"

Methods: A total of 5000 entries from 2195 psychiatrists were examined. A thematic analysis drawing on the framework analysis was undertaken of the 2016 entries. Results: There were 3841 entries for analysis; 1159 entries did not meet the criteria for assessment. The most commonly reported activities were self-assessment programs, feedback on teaching, regular performance reviews, and chart reviews. Less frequent were direct observation, peer supervision, and reviews by provincial medical regulatory authorities. In response to the data, psychiatrists affirmed that their practices were appropriate, identified gaps they intended to address, planned future learning, and/or planned or implemented changes. The assessment activities were internally or externally initiated and resulted in no or small changes (accommodations and adjustments) or redirections. Discussion: Psychiatrists reported participating in a variety of assessment activities that resulted in variable impact on learning and change.

Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) is a telementoring network designed for continuing professional development (CPD) and improving patient outcomes. The purpose of this article was to describe how the model has complied with recommendations from several authoritative reports about redesigning and enhancing CPD.; METHODS: This model links primary care clinicians through a knowledge network with an interprofessional team of specialists from an academic medical center who provide telementoring and ongoing education enabling community clinicians to treat patients with a variety of complex conditions. Knowledge and skills are shared during weekly condition-specific videoconferences.; RESULTS: The model exemplifies learning as described in the seven levels of CPD by Moore (participation, satisfaction, learning, competence, performance, patient, and community health). The model is also aligned with recommendations from four national reports intended to redesign knowledge transfer in improving health care. Efforts in learning sessions focus on information that is relevant to practice, focus on evidence, education methodology, tailoring of recommendations to individual needs and community resources, and interprofessionalism.; DISCUSSION: Project ECHO serves as a telementoring network model of CPD that aligns with current best practice recommendations for CME. This transformative initiative has the potential to serve as a leading model for larger scale CPD, nationally and globally, to enhance access to care, improve quality, and reduce cost.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048970275"

This article reports the development of a new practitioner training intervention, grounded in health psychology theory and evidence designed for practitioners in contact with patients with anaphylaxis to encourage adherence to AAIs. Potential implications for the design, implementation, and evaluation of future practitioner training in strategies they can use to encourage anaphylaxis patients' AAI adherence are discussed.

The teaching methods involved in health care simulation require substantial human, logistical, and financial investments that might preclude their spread in developing countries. The aim of this study was to analyze the health care simulation experiences in developing countries. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed from January 2000 to December 2016. Articles reporting studies on educational health care simulation in developing countries were included. Results: In total, 1161 publications were retrieved, of which 156 were considered eligible based on title and abstract screening. Thirty articles satisfied our predefined selection criteria. Most of the studies were case series; 76.7% (23/30) were prospective and comparative, and five were randomized trials. The development of dedicated task trainers and telesimulation were the primary techniques assessed. The retrieved studies showed encouraging trends in terms of trainee satisfaction with improvement after training, but the improvements were mainly tested on the training tool itself. Two of the tools have been proven to be construct valid with clinical impact. Conclusion: Health care simulation in developing countries seems feasible with encouraging results. Higher-quality studies are required to assess the educational value and promote the development of health care simulation programs.

Annual appraisal is mandatory for all practicing doctors in the United Kingdom as part of medical revalidation. Doctors submit a portfolio of supporting information forming the basis of their appraisal discussion where reflection on the information is mandated and evaluated by a colleague, acting as an appraiser.Methods:Using an in-depth case study approach, 18 online portfolios in Scotland were examined with a template developed to record the types of supporting information submitted and how far these showed reflection and/or changes to practice. Data from semistructured interviews with the doctors (n = 17) and their appraisers (n = 9) were used to contextualize and broaden our understanding of the portfolios.Results:Portfolios generally showed little written reflection, and most doctors were unenthusiastic about documenting reflective practice. Appraisals provided a forum for verbal reflection, which was often detailed in the appraisal summary. Portfolio examples showed that reflecting on continued professional development, audits, significant events, and colleague multisource feedback were sometimes considered to be useful. Reflecting on patient feedback was seen as less valuable because feedback tended to be uncritical.Discussion:The written reflection element of educational portfolios needs to be carefully considered because it is clear that many doctors do not find it a helpful exercise.

Clinicians may develop performance problems for numerous reasons, including health, personal factors, the workplace environment, or outdated knowledge/skills. Performance problems are often complex involving multifactorial issues, encompassing knowledge, skills, and professional behaviors. It is important that (where possible and appropriate) clinicians are supported through effective remediation to return them to safe clinical practice. A review of the literature demonstrated that research into remediation is in its infancy, with little known about the effectiveness of remediation programs currently. Current strategies for the development of remediation programs are mostly ""intuitive""; a few draw upon established theories to inform their approach. Similarly, although it has been established that identification of the nature/scope of performance problems through assessment is an essential first step within remediation, the need for a more widespread ""diagnosis"" of why the problems exist is emerging. These reasons for poor performance, particularly in the context of experienced practicing clinicians, are likely to have an impact on the potential success of remediation and should be considered within the ""diagnosis."" A new model for diagnosing the performance problems of the clinicians has been developed, using behavioral change theories to explore known barriers to successful remediation, such as insight, motivation, attitude, self-efficacy, and the working environment, in addition to addressing known deficits regarding knowledge and skills. This novel approach is described in this article. An initial feasibility study has demonstrated the acceptability and practical implementation of our model.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053344965"

Employing a motivational theory framework, we investigated the relationships of psychological need satisfaction, clinical teaching involvement, and lifelong learning of physicians at different career stages and in various medical specialties. We also examined the associations of physician lifelong learning with stress, burnout, teaching enjoyment, and life satisfaction, all of which are essential for physician well-being and, ultimately, for the provision of quality patient care.Methods:This was a cross-sectional study. Using survey methodology, quantitative data were collected from 202 practicing physicians in Canada. The questionnaire contained validated scales of physician lifelong learning and psychological need satisfaction, measures of clinical teaching (involvement and enjoyment), stress level, burnout frequency, and life satisfaction. Analysis of covariance and correlational analysis were performed.Results:On average, participants reported moderate to moderately high levels of lifelong learning, psychological need satisfaction, teaching enjoyment, and life satisfaction. Irrespective of career stage and specialty, physicians' psychological need satisfaction and involvement in clinical teaching were significant in relation to lifelong learning. That is, physicians who experienced greater psychological need satisfaction at work and those who were involved in clinical teaching had, on average, higher lifelong learning scores. Physician lifelong learning had significant associations with life satisfaction and teaching enjoyment but not with stress level and burnout frequency.Discussion:Fulfilling physicians' basic psychological needs at work and supporting them in their teaching roles is likely to enhance physician lifelong learning and, ultimately, quality of patient care. © 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Grounded in Branch’s Teaching Professional and Humanistic Values model, the program prepares interprofessional faculty mentoring teams in humanistic communities of practice. The teams consist of physician-psychosocial professional pairs, each mentoring a small student group in their professional development course. Through GW-Gold workshops, faculty mentors develop interprofessional humanistic communities of practice, preparing them to lead second such communities with their students. This article describes the program and its evaluation. Methods: To assess outcomes and better understand the mentor experience, we used a mixed-method validating triangulation design consisting of simultaneous collection of quantitative (mentor and student surveys) and qualitative (open-ended survey questions and focus group) data. Data were analyzed in parallel and merged at the point of interpretation, allowing for triangulation and validation of outcomes. Results: Mentors rated the program highly, gained confidence in their humanistic skills, and received high scores from students. Three themes emerged that validated program design, confirmed outcomes, and expanded on the mentor experience: (1) Interprofessional faculty communities developed through observation, collaboration, reflection, and dialogue; (2) Humanistic mentors created safe environments for student engagement; and (3) Engaging in interprofessional humanistic communities of practice expanded mentors’ personal and professional identities. Discussion: Outcomes support the value of the GW-Gold program’s distinctive features in preparing faculty to sustain humanism in medical education: an interprofessional approach and small communities of practice built on humanistic values.

A frequently used and researched classification system for skill mastery is the Dreyfus and Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition. An alternative approach is the core competency framework that informs the assessment of residents and forms the foundation of the American Board of Medical Specialties Program for Maintenance of Certification. There are a number of methods of assessment of each competence. One of the most broadly employed and researched methods is a multisource assessment (360°) methodology.Methods:Three hundred sixty-degree data were collected from 264 raters of physicians holding supervisory roles. Raters included the physicians' leaders, peers, and support/reports. The scale items were taken from an instrument developed for the assessment of interpersonal and communications skills, professionalism, and system-based practice. The Dreyfus scale was purposely built for this application.Results:The Dreyfus scale was reduced to a single dimension, and raters assigned their score on that dimension as the indicator of their assessment of the physician's level of mastery. Results of a multivariate analysis of variance indicated a significant relationship between Dreyfus mastery score and competency items (P <.0001).Discussion:These findings demonstrate a relationship between a measure of Dreyfus skill acquisition and measures based on the American Board of Medical Specialties/Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education six core competency framework. Results have implication for continuing professional development design and assessment. © 2017 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85042885262"

The Group Monitor (GM) is a multisource feedback tool that evaluates the performance of specialty-specific physician groups in hospital settings, as perceived by four different rater classes. In this study, we explored the validity of this tool. Methods: We explored three sources of validity evidence: (1) content, (2) response process, and (3) internal structure. Participants were 254 physicians, 407 staff, 621 peers, and 282 managers of 57 physician groups (in total 479 physicians) from 11 hospitals. Results: Content was supported by the fact that the items were based on a review of an existing instrument. Pilot rounds resulted in reformulation and reduction of items. Four subscales were identified for all rater classes: Medical practice, Organizational involvement, Professionalism, and Coordination. Physicians and staff had an extra subscale, Communication. However, the results of the generalizability analyses showed that variance in GM scores could mainly be explained by the specific hospital context and the physician group specialty. Optimization studies showed that for reliable GM scores, 3 to 15 evaluations were needed, depending on rater class, hospital context, and specialty. Discussion: The GM provides valid and reliable feedback on the performance of specialty-specific physician groups. When interpreting feedback, physician groups should be aware that rater classes' perceptions of their group performance are colored by the hospitals' professional culture and/or the specialty.  © 2019 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071710684"

These challenges highlight the need for education strategies, including training and clinical consultation to support translation of new knowledge to practice. New England AIDS Education and Training Center (NEAETC) provides a range of educational modalities including academic peer detailing and distance support to HIV providers in six states. We describe the interprofessional perspectives of HIV providers who participated in this regional program to understand success and areas for strengthening pedagogical modality, content, and impact on clinical practice.Methods:This 2013 to 2014 mixed-methods study analyzed quantitative programmatic data to understand changes in training participants and modalities and used semistructured interviews with 30 HIV providers and coded for preidentified and emerging themes.Results:Since 2010, NEAETC evolved modalities to a greater focus on active learning (case discussion, clinical consultation), decreasing didactic training by half (18-9%). This shift was designed to move from knowledge transfer to translation, and qualitative findings supported the value of active learning approaches. Providers valued interactive trainings and presentation of cases supporting knowledge translation. On-site training encouraged peer networking and sharing of lessons learned. Diversity in learning priorities across providers and sites validated NEAETC's approach of tailoring topics to local needs and encouraging regional networking.Discussion:Tailored approaches resulted in improved provider-reported capacity, peer learning, and support. Future evaluations should explore the impact of this multipronged approach on supporting a community of practice and empowerment of provider teams. © 2017 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043230685"

The program evaluation consisted of end-of-program reflection reports and semistructured interviews conducted 3 months after the visit, which were thematically analyzed.Results:Three themes related to learning processes emerged: the benefits of observing clinical teaching in a familiar specialty but unfamiliar context; the value of reflection in linking previous experiences with observations; and the role of group interaction and verbalization in creating a sense of community. Three additional themes related to learning outcomes emerged: enhanced knowledge about teaching, with a renewed emphasis on the value of learner respect and trust; increased confidence in teaching competence; and a sense of frustration related to difficulty in changing the status quo.Discussion:An international faculty development program incorporating on-site observational learning in hospital settings with guided reflections can be effective in learning about clinical teaching; follow-up activities in the home country are also recommended. The key elements of this program, including international experiences, on-site observational learning, and guided reflections, should be considered more frequently in faculty development programs in medicine. © 2019 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067269832"

This article describes the program and reports on an evaluation of its impact on attitudes, knowledge, and confidence of the participants in managing diabetic patients. Methods: This study utilized a mixed-method design with focus group (FG), exit assessment, and survey. Ten participants were approached to complete the 2-week DIAMANTE program with hands-on training from a multidisciplinary diabetes team. In addition to an exit assessment and a pre-post online survey to assess attitudes of participants toward diabetes care, diabetes knowledge, and confidence in managing diabetic patients, FG was used to obtain the qualitative feedback of pharmacists. Feedback of the preceptors related to the program and pharmacist performance was also sought through an online survey. Survey data and FGs were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test and thematic analysis, respectively. Results: All participants completed the program successfully. The FGs revealed four themes: program design, participants’ view on preceptors, participants’ perceptions of program benefits, and program’s outlook. Participants perceived the program content as comprehensive and relevant. With experiential learning, the pharmacists reported improved counseling skills and increased understanding of the roles of different healthcare members. Their knowledge and confidence in managing diabetic patients was improved (P =.008). All participants passed the exit assessment. In general, the preceptors were satisfied with the program design, assessment content, and participant performance. Discussion: The overall view of DIAMANTE appeared positive. The program also improved knowledge and confidence of the participants in managing diabetic patients. © 2017 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021167998"

No studies have assessed the value of collaborating with standardized patients (SPs) and patient facilitators (PFs) in the process. In this work, we describe this collaboration in building a simulation and the key elements that facilitate reflection. Methods: Three simulation scenarios surrounding communication were built by teams of clinicians, a PF, and SPs. Six build sessions were audio recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed through an iterative process to (1) describe the steps of building a simulation scenario and (2) identify the key elements involved in the collaboration. Results: The five main steps to build a simulation scenario were (1) storytelling and reflection; (2) defining objectives and brainstorming ideas; (3) building a stem and creating a template; (4) refining the scenario with feedback from SPs; and (5) mock runthroughs with follow-up discussion. During these steps, the PF shared personal insights, challenging participants to reflect deeper to better understand and consider the patient's perspective. The SPs provided unique outside perspective to the group. In addition, the interaction between the SPs and the PF helped refine character roles. Discussion: A collaborative approach incorporating feedback from PFs and SPs to create a simulation scenario is a valuable method to enhance reflective practice for clinicians.

There is no clear understanding of the term Continuing Professional Development (CPD) engagement for allied health professionals and Nurses and Midwives in the UK, although it is becoming a frequently used term. This raises the challenge of creating measures of the impact of CPD engagement. This concept analysis therefore sought to operationalize the term CPD engagement. Methods: A theoretical concept analysis was undertaken, as part of a Professional Doctorate, using Walker and Avant's Concept Analysis Framework. Literature was accessed via OVID, PubMed, CINAHL, ERIC, ABI INFO, and PsychINFO using search terms engagement, work/employee, user, consumer, scholarly engagement, CPD, and life-long learning. Results: Defining attributes for CPD engagement included criteria based around the terms such as self-initiated, voluntary, applied, recorded, evaluated and shared, and continuation of learning beyond the initial activity. Antecedents focused around drive and availability of resources including time, money, and support. Discussion: There are potentially many positive consequences of CPD engagement, such as job satisfaction, employee retention, and quality of service provision, that may be more easily investigated and measured against the attributes defined from this study, which indicates that CPD engagement is characterized by the following five criteria: (1) self-initiated; (2) rewarded (either intrinsically or extrinsically); (3) applied in practice; (4) recorded, evaluated, and shared with others; and finally (5) continues beyond the initial learning activity.

This study examines the experiences and opinions of NKRDs in their attempts to acquire permission to legally practice medicine in South Korea and the opinions of South Korean experts regarding this matter.Methods:In-depth interviews were conducted among 23 participants divided into 2 groups. The first group comprised 16 NKRDs recruited through snowball sampling, whereas the second group included 7 South Korean doctors experienced in operating programs assisting NKRDs in license acquisition.Results:All participating NKRDs perceived that they face grave difficulties at every stage of acquiring a South Korean medical license and, particularly, in gaining recognition for their educational credentials. Furthermore, South Korean experts expressed the necessity of supporting, establishing, and expanding a system in the country whereby NKRDs can acquire a medical license.Discussion:Strengthening and changing their clinical competency to meet South Korean standards is the best option for NKRDs to acquire a medical license. Furthermore, the study reveals that the government should eliminate the obstacles in medical license acquisition by NKRDs and support the latter in their efforts to improve and demonstrate their competency. © 2019 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067269432"

However, little is known about how to develop these platforms to support the implementation of best practices for health care professionals. The aim of this article is to explore pediatric physiotherapists' (PTs) perspectives regarding the utility and usability of the characteristic of a web platform developed to support virtual communities of practice (vCoP). Methods: This study adopted an explanatory sequential mixed methods design. A web platform supporting the interactions of vCoP members was developed for PTs working with children with developmental coordination disorder. Specific strategies and features were created to support the effectiveness of the platform across three domains: social, information-quality, and systemquality factors. Quantitative data were collected from a cross-sectional survey (n = 41) after 5 months of access to the web platform. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Qualitative data were also collected from semistructured interviews (n = 9), which were coded, interpreted, and analyzed by using Boucher's Web Ergonomics Conceptual Framework. Results: The utility of web platform characteristics targeting the three key domain factors were generally perceived positively by PTs. However, web platform usability issues were noted by PTs, including problems with navigation and information retrieval. Discussion: Web platform aiming to support vCoP should be carefully developed to target potential users' needs. Whenever possible, users should co-construct the web platform with vCoP developers. Moreover, each of the developed characteristics (eg, newsletter, search function) should be evaluated in terms of utility and usability for the users. © 2018 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education,and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053428263"

However, limited empirical research has been performed to characterize the relationship and integration between CME and QI/patient safety in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). To explore health care leaders' perceptions and experiences of collaboration between the CME department (CME-D) and the quality management administration (QMA), we conducted an exploratory qualitative study at a large governmental health care center-King Abdullah Medical City (KAMC) in Makkah, KSA. Methods: The health care managers at KAMC were asked to identify their perception on the state of collaboration between the CME-D and QMA. Data collection, in the form of one-to-one semistructured interviews, was directed by an interview guide. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and the participants' perspectives were analyzed thematically using a theoretical framework. Results: Fifteen participants were recruited: One top manager of the CME-D, three top managers from the QMA, seven representatives from the medical board, and four representatives from the executive board. Key findings of the interviews were the presence of some shared ad hoc goals between the CME-D and QMA. However, insufficiency of other collaborative factors reflected a ""potential collaboration"" (level 1) based on D'Amour's model of collaboration. Discussion: This is the first qualitative study to explore the perceptions and experiences of CME and QI health care managers on their collaboration at one of the largest health centers in the KSA. Further research should investigate the feasibility of implementing interventions to intensify collaboration between CME and QI. © 2018 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057551502"

A mentoring approach is used to deliver individualized educational opportunities over the course of a year focused on preparing clinicians to provide high-quality patient-centered HIV care. Evaluation of the program has illustrated increases in knowledge, skills, and practice behavior, yet critical domains remain unexplored, particularly the potential for the program to affect professional identity formation and networking between individual clinicians. Methods: Qualitative exit interviews (N = 50) were conducted over 4 years of the Clinician Scholars Program. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using an open-coding process with multiple coders. Interrater reliability was assessed. Themes related to professional development and networking emerged. Results: Thematic analysis revealed changes in several professional development domains, including self-efficacy, HIV care clinician identity, and career development. In addition, clinicians began to develop key connections with mentors, other clinicians, and health systems-gaining a foundation in the HIV care community, enabled and strengthened by growth in professional confidence and competence within the clinician's care context. Discussion: Evaluations of clinical training programs often focus on knowledge and skill gains without addressing professional identity development and place within the care community. This study illustrates that a longitudinal clinician training program has the potential to influence professional identify development, particularly affect how clinicians view themselves as a resource in the HIV care community and begins to facilitate necessary connections to other clinicians and the wider care system.

During the preceding years, the continuing education (CE) accreditors in the health professions identified a need for a strategic, coordinated effort that would involve an interprofessional coalition of multiple stakeholders to respond to this emerging public health challenge. The Conjoint Committee on Continuing Education, a national coalition of organizations in the professions of medicine, nursing, dentistry, pharmacy, and physician assistants, stepped up to assume a leadership position. To address the scope of safety issues involved in opioids, the US Food and Drug Administration required that extended-release and long-acting opioid analgesic product manufacturers make training available to prescribers of their products and recommended that the training should be conducted by accredited, independent CE providers. CE accreditors in the health professions initiated an unprecedented collaboration that leveraged the accredited CE community to deliver prescriber education as part of the Food and Drug Administration Opioid Analgesics Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy.

In order to address this issue, a change in how health care professionals are trained may be essential. However, the majority of the few reports published on this field’s training programs do not discuss the characteristics associated with the success or failure of these strategies. The purpose of this review was to systematically examine the literature about mental health training programs designed for health care professionals in order to identify the relevant factors associated with their effective implementation. Methods: The MEDLINE/PubMed, SciELO, and Virtual Health Library databases were used to search for articles published before February 2017 and reviewed by two double-blind reviewers. Results: We found 77 original papers about mental health educational programs. Many of these studies were conducted in the USA (39%), addressed depression as the main subject (34%), and applied a quasi-experimental design (52%). Effective interventions were associated with the following characteristics: the use of learner-centered and interactive methodological approaches; a curriculum based on challenges in the trainees’ daily routines; the involvement of experts in the program’s development; the enrollment of experienced participants; interdisciplinary group work; flexible timing; the use of e-learning resources; and optimizing the implementation of knowledge into the participants’ routine work practices. Implications for Practice: These results will be helpful for planning and improving the quality of future educational programs in mental health.

Within medical education, many new techniques have been employed in the undergraduate setting, with less utilization thus far in the continuing medical education (CME) sphere. This paper discusses the use of a new method for CME—the “flipped classroom,” widely used in undergraduate medical education. This method engages learners by providing content before the live (“in class”) session that aids in preparation and fosters in-class engagement. Methods: A flipped classroom method was employed using an online image-rich case-based module and quiz prior to a live CME session at a national nuclear medicine meeting. The preparatory material provided a springboard for in-depth discussion at the live session—a case-based activity utilizing audience response technology. Study participants completed a survey regarding their initial experience with this new instructional method. In addition, focus group interviews were conducted with session attendees who had or had not completed the presession material; transcripts were qualitatively analyzed. Results: Quantitative survey data (completed by two-thirds of the session attendees) suggested that the flipped method was highly valuable and met attendee educational objectives. Analysis of focus group data yielded six themes broadly related to two categories—benefits of the flipped method for CME and programmatic considerations for successfully implementing the flipped method in CME. Discussion: Data from this study have proven encouraging and support further investigations around the incorporation of this innovative teaching method into CME for nuclear imaging specialists.

We suggest that a continuing education through a brief gatekeeper suicide training program could be a suitable platform to improve suiciderelated knowledge, self-efficacy, and attitudes. This study aimed at examining the effectiveness of the Question, Persuade, Refer gatekeeper program on improving the knowledge, self-efficacy in suicide prevention, and understanding of/willingness to help suicidal patients of Malaysian hospital health professionals. Methods: The Question, Persuade, Refer program materials were translated and adapted for implementation in the hospital setting for nonpsychiatric health professionals. There were 159 (mean age = 35.75 years; SD = 12.26) participants in this study. Most participants were female (84.9%), staff/community nurses (52.2%), who worked in the general medical department (30.2%) and had no experience managing suicidal patients (64.2%). Intervention participants (n = 53) completed a survey questionnaire at pretraining, immediately after training, and after three months. Control participants (n = 106) were not exposed to the training program and completed the same questionnaire at baseline and three months later. Results: Significant improvement occurred among intervention participants in terms of perceived knowledge, self-efficacy, and understanding of/willingness to help suicidal patients immediately after training and when compared with the control participants 3 months later. Improvements in declarative knowledge were not maintained at the 3-month follow-up. Discussion: This study confirmed the short-term effectiveness of the gatekeeper training program. Gatekeeper suicide training is recommended for implementation for nonpsychiatric health professionals nationwide. © 2018 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057567321"

Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 42 monoscopic color optic disc images were presented to 46 orthoptists who assessed the likelihood of glaucoma as well as optic disc size, shape, tilting, vertical cup-to-disc ratio, cup shape, depth, presence of hemorrhage, peripapillary atrophy, and retinal nerve fiber layer. The level of agreement with specialist ophthalmologists was assessed. Participants were then randomly assigned to an experimental group (targeted postgraduate education on optic disc assessment) or to no intervention. The educational program was designed to increase knowledge of the characteristic features associated with glaucomatous optic neuropathy. All participants re-examined the included optic disc images after a period of 6 to 8 weeks. The primary outcome measure was a change in agreement between attempts. Results: The education group showed significant improvements between attempts for identifying hemorrhages (P = .013), retinal nerve fiber layer defects (0.035), disc size (P = .001), peripapillary atrophy (P = .030), and glaucoma likelihood (P = .023). The control group did not show any statistically significant improvement. The intervention group showed significantly more improvement when identifying hemorrhages (P = .013), disc size (P = .001), disc shape (P = .033), and cup shape (P = .020) compared with the control group. Discussion: Orthoptists who received additional postgraduate online education based on principles of adult learning were more accurate at assessing the optic disc for glaucoma.

The authors assessed participants' views about the educational value of learning with colleagues of mixed health care professions in communication and relational skills training focused on challenging conversations. Methods: Between 2010 and 2013, 783 participants enrolled in 46 workshops hosted by the Institute for Professionalism and Ethical Practice at Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, USA. Participants received pre-, post-, and 3-month follow-up questionnaires with quantitative and qualitative questions about their experiences learning with clinicians of varying professions (""interprofessional learning""). Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used to compare participant groups. Responses to open-ended questions were coded according to standard principles of content analysis. Results: Seven hundred twenty-two (92%) participants completed surveys. Previous interprofessional learning was reported by 60% of respondents, but generally comprised <30% of their education. Clinicians with <3 years of work experience were least likely to have previous interprofessional learning. Nearly all (96%) participants reported interprofessional colleagues contributed valuably to their learning. Asked specifically what they learned, participants described five themes: Stronger Teamwork, Patient-Centered Focus, Specific Communication Skills, Content-Specific Knowledge, and Shared Global Values. After 3 months, 64% of respondents reported that workshop participation helped make their interactions with interprofessional colleagues more collaborative. Discussion: Communication skills training for challenging health care conversations is a valuable opportunity for interprofessional learning and generates sustained positive attitudes about collaboration.

This study's purpose was to determine factors that influence physician engagement with practice data to advance competence and drive practice change.Methods:A practice-based, pan-Canadian survey was administered to three physician subspecialties: psychiatrists (Psy), radiation oncologists (RO), and general surgeons (GS). The survey was distributed through national specialty society membership lists. The survey assessed factors that influence the use of data for practice improvement and orientation to lifelong learning, using the Jefferson Scale of Physician Lifelong Learning (JeffSPLL). Linear regression was used to model the relationship between the outcome variable frequency of data use and independent predictors of continuous learning to improving practice.Results:A total of 305 practicing physicians (Psy = 203, RO = 53, GS = 49) participated in this study. Most respondents used data for practice improvement (n = 177, 61.7%; Psy = 115, 40.1%; RO = 35; 12.2%; GS = 27, 9.4%) and had high orientation to lifelong learning (JeffSPLL mean scores: Psy = 47.4; RO = 43.5; GS = 45.1; Max = 56). Linear regression analysis identified significant predictors of data use in practice being: frequency of assessing learning needs, helpfulness of data to improve practice, and frequency to develop learning plans. Together, these predictors explained 42.9% of the variance in physicians' orientation toward integrating accessible data into practice (R2= 0.426, P <.001).Discussion:This study demonstrates an association between practice data use and perceived data utility, reflection on learning needs and learning plan development. Implications for this work include process development for data-informed action planning for practice improvement for physicians. © 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This study evaluated an implementation intervention that targeted teams' perceptions of evidence-based practice (EBP), implementation leadership, and team functioning that might facilitate PROM use.Methods:We compared clinicians' perceptions on three inpatient rehabilitation units, with sequential implementation across units. Clinicians completed the EBP Attitudes Scale, Implementation Leadership Scale, and the Team Functioning Survey before, shortly after, and 1 month after training.Results:Forty-seven clinicians participated, including nurses (27.7%), occupational (21.3%) and physical therapists (21.3%), and two physicians. They worked on spinal cord injury (46.8%), neurologic (40.4%), or pediatric (12.8%) units. EBP Attitude Scale scores improved from preintervention to postintervention and remained above baseline levels at follow-up. The interaction between time and unit was statistically significant for the Divergence subscale such that Pediatric Unit scores increased from preintervention to postintervention and follow-up, while on the spinal cord injury, unit scores increased from preintervention to postintervention, and on the Neurologic Unit scores declined from preintervention to postintervention and follow-up. The EBP Attitudes Requirements score increased at postintervention and follow-up. The Implementation Leadership Scale Proactive score and team functioning survey scores decreased slightly.Discussion:Implementing PROMs had varied effects on EBP attitudes and perceptions of leadership and team functioning. Perceptions across units were distinctive on the Evidence-Based Practice Attitudes Scale Divergence subscale. Introduction of PROMs should consider clinician attitudes regarding EBP as well as implementation leadership and team functioning. © 2019 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067267910"

Identifying what impedes clinicians’ use of a SAT can help tailor strategies promoting its use in clinical practice. This article presents the development of the “Measure of potential barriers and facilitators to the Use of a Standardized assessment Tool (MUST)” questionnaire. Preliminary findings are also reported from pilot testing in which the MUST was used to investigate occupational therapists’ (OTs) perceptions of potential barriers and facilitators to the use of the Activities of Daily Living Profile (ADL Profile), a SAT evaluating independence in everyday activities of cognitively impaired adults. Methods: The MUST was administered to 41 OTs attending continuing education workshops on the ADL Profile. Internal consistency was explored using Chronbach alpha. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze scores for each statement. Results: Internal consistency for subscales related to clinicians’ characteristics (a = 0.7) and to the SAT’s characteristics (a = 0.8) were adequate but lower for the subscale related to the clinical setting (a = 0.6). OTs’ perceptions of potential barriers were associated with: OTs’ perceived self-efficacy; ADL Profile’s applicability to OTs’ clienteles; ADL Profile’s compatibility with values promoted in the work setting and with clients’ preferences; limited peer support; time to implement the ADL Profile. Discussion: The MUST, a theory-informed questionnaire, may prove useful in identifying potential barriers needing to be addressed in continuing education training promoting the use of SATs by clinicians. The MUST is quick to administer and initial testing provides support for its internal consistency.

This evaluation of a continuing medical education workshop, to enhance family physicians' clinical approach by including social and cultural dimensions within diabetes management, was conducted to determine whether participation in the workshop improved self-reported knowledge, skills, and confidence in working with Indigenous patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: The workshop, developed from rigorous national research with Indigenous patients, diabetes care physicians, and Indigenous health medical educators, was attended by 32 family physicians serving Indigenous populations on three sites in Northern Ontario. A same-day evaluation survey assessed participants' satisfaction with workshop content and delivery. Preworkshop and postworkshop surveys consisting of 5-point Likert and open-ended questions were administered 1 week before and 3 month after the workshop. Descriptive statistics and t test were performed to analyze Likert scale questions; thematic analysis was used to elicit and cluster themes from open-ended responses. Results: Participants reported high satisfaction with all aspects of the workshop. Reporting improved understanding of socioeconomic (P = .002), psychosocial, and cultural factors (P = .001), participants also described adapting their clinical approach to more actively incorporating social and cultural factors and focusing on patient-centered care. Discussion: The workshop was effective in shifting physician's self-reported knowledge, attitudes, and skills resulting in clinical approach modifications within social, psychosocial, and cultural domains for their Indigenous patients with diabetes. © 2018 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education,and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053918442"

This article presents the findings of a systematic rapid evidence assessment that aimed to investigate the impact of FD on clinical teachers. Methods: We searched the published and gray literature for systematic reviews of FD to identify evidence to help inform judgments about which kinds of FD activities are effective for which groups of clinical teachers. Results: After screening the literature, we found seven systematic reviews met our inclusion criteria. Following a critical analysis of these reviews, we found that they contained a number of limitations in relation to their use of review methods and reporting of results. Discussion: On the basis of the analysis presented in this systematic rapid evidence assessment, we conclude that the included reviews do not provide high-quality evidence to effectively support decisions about choices of FD activities, even where the review authors made positive claims about impact. Suggestions are provided to improve the quality of systematic reviews in this area.

This dynamic learning process takes a substantial commitment from professionals and requires a positive attitude toward EBP. The main objective of this research was to explore the following: 1) distinct dimensions of attitudes toward adoption of EBP among physical therapists and social workers and 2) the relationship between these dimensions of attitudes and selected background characteristics of the compared professions.Methods:Cross-sectional web-based surveys were conducted in 2012 and 2013 on a population-based sample from the Icelandic Physical Therapy Association and the Icelandic Association of Social Workers. The participants were 214 physical therapists (76.3% women) and 163 social workers (92.2% women). The Evidence-Based Practice Attitude Scale (EBPAS) and its four subscales were used to survey dimensions of attitudes toward EBP. Scores on the total EBPAS range from zero to five, with a higher score indicating a more positive attitude toward EBPs. Linear regression was used to explore the relationship between the EBPAS scales and selected background variables.Results:The overall response rate was 39%. Both professions generally held positive attitudes toward adoption of EBP, with an average EBPAS total score of 3.06 (SD = 0.46). The professionals' background characteristics were independently related to at least one dimension of attitudes toward EBP. More positive attitudes were associated with being a physical therapist, a woman, in a younger age group, having a graduate degree, working with individual clients, and having at least five same-profession coworkers.Discussion:The results may be useful to design continuing education focusing on EBP. Such inventions should be targeted to professional attitudes, background, and other contextual factors. © 2017 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85043329025"

Most faculty development programs focus on supporting individual projects, which helps faculty members who are already pursuing an intellectual question to locate useful resources. Those programs provide limited benefit, however, to faculty members without an identified academic project. An independent, health sciences graduate school designed and implemented a solution to create scholarship groups in which early career faculty members joined ongoing projects led by an experienced investigator. Groups presented internally at a midyear check-in and an end of the academic year poster session. Of the four groups launched in September 2017, three pursued systematic reviews or analyses of existing data. At the end of 9 months, all 4 groups had drafted a manuscript for peer review. Collectively, members of the group had made five poster presentations at national or international conferences and hosted one continuing education workshop. The experience suggests that collaborative projects are a viable form of faculty development to enhance scholarly productivity. Borrowing from the postdoctoral model of scientific mentoring, early career faculty members sacrifice some autonomy of intellectual pursuits in exchange for expert guidance. Senior investigators invest time in coaching novice researchers in exchange for additional intellectual labor and perspectives.  © 2019 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071715087"

Methods: During 2014 to 2016, two consecutive cohorts of nurses and physicians completed the MAP-IT program. Participants included 169 high potential mentors (HPMs) and 61 facilitator leaders. Each 10-month program consisted of small group work, experiential learning, and critical reflection aimed at enhancing humanistic mentoring skills. Throughout the program, facilitator leaders served as mentors for the HPMs. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected to measure changes in skill levels specific to humanistic teaching practices, as well as overall evaluation of the program's curriculum and logistics. Quantitative data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, descriptive statistics, and Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Qualitative data assessing the overall impact and applicability of the program to the clinical setting were analyzed using content analysis methodology. Results: Across cohorts, HPMs demonstrated significant increases in perceptions of humanistic teaching skills. During objective structured teaching simulations, significant increases were also found in HPMs' self-reported mentoring skills and their skills as rated by a standardized RN/MD. Qualitative analyses revealed themes of the program to be skill development and application, mentorship, humanism, mindfulness, self-care, and acknowledgment of overlapping interprofessional roles. Discussion: Utilizing an interprofessional education approach, the MAP-IT program was determined to be a feasible strategy to positively impact the personal and professional development of nurses and physicians. © 2018 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education,and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053871246"

This article aims to explore the self-perceived competency levels and the professional educational needs of pharmacists in Qatar and to compare these with observations of pharmacy students undergoing experiential training in pharmacies (students) and pharmacy academics, directors, and managers (managers). Methods: Three questionnaires were developed and administered to practicing pharmacists, undergraduate pharmacy students who have performed structured experiential training rotations in multiple pharmacy outlets in Qatar and pharmacy managers. The questionnaires used items extracted from the National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities (NAPRA) Professional competencies for Canadian pharmacists at entry to practice and measured self-and observed pharmacists’ competency and satisfaction with competency level. Results: Training and educational needs were similar between the pharmacists and observers, although there was trend for pharmacists to choose more fact-intensive topics compared with observers whose preferences were toward practice areas. There was no association between the competency level of pharmacists as perceived by observers and as self-assessed by pharmacists (P ≤.05). Pharmacists’ self-assessed competency level was consistently higher than that reported by students (P ≤.05). Discussion: The results suggest that the use of traditional triangulation might not be sufficient to articulate the professional needs and competencies of practicing pharmacists as part of a strategy to build continuing professional development programs. Pharmacists might have a limited ability to accurately self-assess, and observer assessments might be significantly different from self-assessments which present a dilemma on which assessment to consider closer to reality. The processes currently used to evaluate competence may need to be enhanced through the use of well-designed rubrics or other strategies to empower and to better inform respondents and subsequently improve their ability to self-assess their competencies. © 2017 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021149182"

Health care professions training at the undergraduate and graduate levels in managing chronic pain is insufficient. The Chronic Pain and Headache Management TeleECHO Clinic (ECHO Pain) is a telehealth approach at Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes), which supports clinicians interested in improving their knowledge and confidence in treating patients with chronic pain and safe opioid management. It is a vehicle for educating practicing clinicians (at the ""spoke"") based on work-place learning with cases selected by participants from their patient panels combined with short lectures by experts (at the ""hub""). ECHO Pain has designed an innovative, interprofessional longitudinal curriculum appropriate for individual and team-based clinicians which includes relevant basic and advanced pain topics. The specific design and delivery of the curriculum enhances its relevance and accessibility to busy clinicians in practice, yet also satisfies statutory requirements for CME in New Mexico. Specific features which balance hub-and-spoke needs are presented in this descriptive article, which is intended to serve as a guide to other clinician educators interested in developing or implementing similar telehealth curricula.

This study describes providers' reflections on their data and evaluates the hospitalist physicians' impressions about receiving this feedback derived from a new survey metric specifically designed to obtain patient assessment of their treating hospitalist provider coupled with reflective sessions. Methods: Participants were 26 hospitalists from one institution. These physicians' data were used for the development and validation of a new metric, Tool to Assess Inpatient Satisfaction with Care from Hospitalists (TAISCH). Participants received a summary of ratings from patients for whom they were the primary provider. This was followed by a 15-minute semistructured telephone interview to discuss the data. Participants then completed an online survey to assess their perceptions about the data and the efficacy of the feedback. Both quantitative and qualitative results were analyzed. Results: All 26 providers reviewed their evaluation data, participated in the discussion of results by phone, and completed the online survey. Most (54%) agreed that TAISCH was superior to Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems in providing hints on how to improve the quality of the care and in providing detailed information about the performance in specific areas (62%). After stratifying hospitalists according to their performance, it was observed that those who scored better responded more favorably to the data. The two main themes that emerged from the qualitative analysis were ""reflection on one's performance"" and ""feedback using TAISCH."" Discussion: Most hospitalists in our study felt that TAISCH provided meaningful feedback.

This qualitative study explored the experience of building and participating in a simulation as an educational intervention with experienced clinicians. Methods: Pediatric rehabilitation clinicians, along with a patient facilitator and standardized patients, created simulations and subsequently participated in a live simulation. The educational content of the simulation was culturally sensitive communication. We collected participants’ perspectives about the process from individual journal entries and focus groups. A thematic analysis of these data sources was conducted. Results: Participants described a process of building and participating in a simulation that provided: 1) a unique opportunity for clinicians to reflect on their current practice; 2) a venue to identify different perspectives through discussion and action in a group; and 3) a safe environment for learning. Discussion: The combined process of building and participating in a simulation stimulated reflection about the clinicians’ own abilities in culturally sensitive communication through discussion, practice, and feedback. It provided a safe environment for participants to share their multiple perspectives and to develop new ways of communicating.

Methods: From September 2015 to April 2016, we administered a survey to 4648 randomly sampled licensed US physicians. Survey items addressed perceived barriers to CPD, factors that might influence participation in four prototypical CPD activities (reading an article, or completing a local activity, online course, or far-away course), and frequency of CPD engagement. Results: Nine hundred eighty-eight (21.6%) physicians responded. The most important barriers were time (mean [SD] 3.5 [1.3], 1 = not important, 5 = extremely important) and cost (2.9 [1.3]). In prioritizing factors influencing participation in four prototypical CPD activities, topical relevance consistently had the highest average rank. Quality of content and time to complete the activity were also frequently selected. Over the past 3 years, most physicians reported having participated in patient-focused learning and selfdirected learning on a weekly basis; quality improvement and local continuing medical education (CME) activities several times per year; online learning, on-site courses, and national board-related activities a few times per year; and interprofessional learning less than once per year. Physicians believed that they ought to engage more often in all of these activities except board-related activities. They would like CME credit for these activities much more often than currently obtained. Discussion: The reasons physicians select a given CPD activity vary by activity, but invariably include topic and quality of content. Physicians want CME credit for the CPD activities they are already doing.

Use of implementation science (IS) frameworks designed to convert evidence-based intervention methods into effective health care practice may help PD developers translate proven educational methods and models into successful, well-run programs. Implementation of the national Educational Scholars Program (ESP) is used to illustrate the value of the IS model. Methods: Four adaptable elements of IS are described: (1) replication of an evidence-based model, (2) systematic stages of implementation, (3) management of implementation using three implementation drivers, and (4) demonstration of program success through measures of fidelity to proven models and sustainability. Results: Implementation of the ESP was grounded on five established principles and methods for successful PD. The process was conducted in four IS stages over 10 years: Exploration, Installation, Initial Implementation, and Full Implementation. To ensure effective and efficient processes, attention to IS implementation drivers helped to manage organizational relationships, build competence in faculty and scholars, and address leadership challenges. We describe the ESP’s fidelity to evidence-based structures and methods, and offer three examples of sustainability efforts that enabled achievement of targeted program outcomes, including academic productivity, strong networking, and career advancement of scholars. Discussion: Application of IS frameworks to program implementation may help other PD programs to translate evidence-based methods into interventions with enhanced impact. A PD program can follow systematic developmental stages and be operationalized by practical implementation drivers, thereby creating successful and sustainable interventions that promote the academic vitality of health professions educators. © 2017 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021055581"

A new paradigm for CE is necessary in order to change clinician behavior and to improve patient outcomes in an increasingly patient-centered, quality-oriented care context. The authors assert that a new paradigm should focus attention on an expanded and prioritized list of educational outcomes, starting with those that directly affect patients. Other important components of the paradigm should provide educational leaders with guidance about what interventions work, reasons why interventions work, and what contextual factors may influence the impact of interventions. Once fully developed, a new paradigm will be helpful to educators in designing and implementing more effective CE, an essential component of quality improvement efforts, and in supporting policy trends and in promoting CE scholarship. The purpose of this article is to rekindle interest in CE theory and to suggest key components of a new paradigm.

Interprofessional education is particularly important for IEHPs to integrate into the Canadian health care system. We designed an online interprofessional education curriculum for IEHPs. The curriculum is designed to cover the six interprofessional competency domains defined in the Canadian Interprofessional Health Collaborative National Interprofessional Competency Framework. In this article, we are presenting findings from the pilot testing of the curriculum with a cohort of IEHPs and educators. Methods: We conducted surveys and interviews with IEHPs and educators from four provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba). We aimed to include seven healthcare professionals: licensed practical nurses, registered nurses, registered psychiatric nurses, pharmacists, physicians, occupational therapists, and physical therapists. We also used a pre- post- self-assessment tool and a set of reflective questions to measure the effectiveness of the curriculum. Results: Thirty IEHPs and five educators reviewed the online curriculum and participated in this evaluation. Postintervention confidence scores for all items under the role clarification and patient-centered care domains increased significantly (P = <0.01) after module completion. The scores also increased for most questions in team functioning, collaborative leadership, and communication domains. The postassessment scores increased for only half of the questions in conflict management domains. Participants agreed with the appropriateness of the content in terms of language, scenarios, and cultural aspects covered in the online curriculum on interprofessional education. Discussion: The content of the curriculum improved IEHPs' understanding of interprofessional collaboration in Canada. The interprofessional curriculum is a creative and useful resource to improve collaborative practice among internationally educated health professionals in Canada. © 2017 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049073971"

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) reduces risk of progression to diabetes, yet implementation has been elusive within health disparities populations. Methods: This community-based, collaborative project piloted the NDPP in the South Bronx and evaluated implementation challenges and enablers. The New York State training group prepared community peer lifestyle coaches recruited by a community organization. A professional society trained academic detailers from local faculty. An interview process evaluated community needs and public health officials’ beliefs. A portal managed by the New York State training group collected demographic and biometric data from the community participants and facilitated online registration. Data from interviews and observations were coded systematically using a thematic analysis framework. Results: We were successful at recruiting and training 14 lifestyle coaches and 7 academic detailers, as well as recruiting members of the health disparities population in the South Bronx into the program. Fifty-two individuals completed the first 6 months of the yearlong program, attending an average of 12.7 of 16 sessions. By week 16, weight loss averaged 7.4 lbs and many had doubled their minutes of physical activity. Local electronic referral and feedback systems were developed. Discussion: Health professionals, their teams, public health centers, and communities can work together to prevent diabetes by enhancing the reach of the NDPP to health disparities populations. Peer education using lifestyle coaches can provide a trustworthy process for crossing the boundaries between health teams and community support groups. © 2016 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006511963"

One of the most broadly used frameworks for assessing skills is Miller’s Pyramid. This Pyramid has a series of levels of achievement beginning with knowledge (at the base) and ending with routine application in the clinical setting. Methods: The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of convergence of two measurement methods, one based on Miller’s framework, the second using the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education/American Board of Medical Specialties (ACGME/ ABMS) Core Competency framework. The data were gathered from the faculty of a large, Midwestern regional health care provider and hospital system. Data from 264 respondents were studied. The 360° data were from raters of physicians holding supervisory roles in the organization. The scale items were taken from an instrument that has been validated for both structure and known group prediction. Results: The Miller scale was purposely built for this application. The questions were designed to describe each level of the model. The Miller scale was reduced to a single dimension. This result was then regressed on the items from the 360° item ratings. Results of a multivariate analysis of variance isolated a significant relationship between the Miller’s Pyramid score and the competency items (P < 0.001). Discussion: These findings demonstrate a relationship between measures based on Miller’s framework and behavioral measures based on the ABMS/ACGME core competencies. Equally important is the finding that while they are related they are not identical. These findings have implications for continuous professional development programing design. © 2016 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006381788"

The aims of this study were to refine a previously published version of the Interprofessional Socialization and Valuing Scale (the ISVS-24) and create two shorter equivalent forms to be used in pre–post studies. Methods: A graded response model was used to identify ISVS items in a practitioner data set (n = 345), with validation (measure invariance) conducted using a separate student sample (n = 341). Results: Analyses indicated a unidimensional 21-item version with excellent measurement properties, Cronbach alpha of 0.988, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.985–0.991. There was evidence of measure invariance, as there was excellent agreement of the factor scores for the practitioner and student data, intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.993, 95% CI 0.991–0.994. This indicates that the ISVS-21 measures IP socialization consistently across groups. Two 9-item equivalent versions for pre–post use were developed, with excellent agreement between the two forms. The student score agreement for the two item sets was excellent: intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.970, 95% CI 0.963–0.976. Discussion: The ISVS-21 is a refined measure to assess existing levels of IP socialization in practitioners and students, and relate IP socialization to other important constructs such as IP collaboration and the development of an IP identity. The equivalent versions can be used to assess change in IP socialization as a result of interprofessional education.

In this article, we examine the changing context in which CPD is provided and explain how graduate programs in health professions education can be used as a strategy to strengthen the preparation of individuals for CPD practice and advance the delivery of CPD through evidence-based and innovative strategies. © 2017 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Note","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021110425"

The GenetiKit trial demonstrated effectiveness of a knowledge translation intervention on family physicians’ (FP) genetics referral decision-making. Most wanted to continue receiving Gene Messengers (GM), evidence-based summaries of new genetic tests with primary care recommendations. Our objective was to determine the value of GMs as a continuing education (CE) strategy in genomic medicine for FPs. Methods: Using a “push” model, we invited 19,060 members of the College of Family Physicians of Canada to participate. Participants read GMs online, receiving 12 emailed topics over 6 months. Participants completed an online Information Assessment Method questionnaire evaluating GMs on four constructs: cognitive impact, relevance, intended use of information for a patient, and expected health benefits. Results: One thousand four hundred two FPs participated, 55% rated at least one GM. Most (73%) indicated their practice would be improved after reading GMs, with referral to genetics ranked highly. Of those who rated a GM relevant, 94% would apply it to at least one patient and 79% would expect health benefits. This method of CE was found useful for genetics by 88% and 94% wanted to continue receiving GMs. Discussion: FPs found this novel CE strategy, brief individual reflective e-learning, to be valuable for learning about genetics. This method of information delivery may be an especially effective method for CE in genomic medicine where discoveries occur at a rapid pace and lack of knowledge is a barrier to integration of genetic services.

Understanding how health care practitioners adopt mindfulness practices is limited, which poses a hurdle to the development of effective mindfulness training programs. To explore how health professionals use and perceive mindfulness practices at work, we conducted an exploratory qualitative study at a large multicomponent inner-city health system. Methods: All participants were self-selected health professionals who attended at least one mindfulness training. Training content was derived from the Tergar Meditation Community’s nonsectarian Joy of Living program and focused on calming the mind using a flexible and broadly applicable approach. Transcribed interview data were examined using thematic analysis. Results: Individuals receiving mindfulness training varied substantially in their subsequent adoption and utilization of these practices. Interviewees’ experiences overall suggest that the workplace presents a relatively challenging but nonetheless viable environment for being mindful. Health care workers relied on more informal practice models than on formal meditation practice routines while at work. Factors reported by some individuals to inhibit effective mindfulness practice supported mindfulness for others, and overall displayed equivocal effects. Discussion: Adoption and integration of mindfulness practices within the workplace are feasible yet vary significantly by practice type, situation, and the individual. Greater understanding of how individuals adopt workplace mindfulness training could improve future intervention research while clarifying optimal mindfulness training approaches. © 2016 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006507858"

Adding to these pressures is an emerging discourse of dissatisfaction by physicians participating in MOC programs suggesting physicians themselves are seeking programs that are relevant to their scope of practice. The object was to determine Canadian specialists’ views of a redesigned Royal College of Physician and Surgeons of Canada’s MOC program in five priority areas: complexity, motivation, impact, credit sufficiency, and enhancement. Methods: A national, cross-specialty, survey of Royal College of Physician and Surgeons of Canada’s MOC program users who had participated for at least 1 year. Results: Five thousand two hundred fifty nine respondents were included in the analysis. A majority of participates either “agreed” (2258, 43%) or “strongly agreed” (631, 12%) that the new framework was simpler to understand and the redesigned submission templates were simpler to use (“agree” 2297 [43.7%], “strongly agree” 701 [13.3%]). A total of 64.5% had a good understanding of the program purposes; however, some respondents believe the program does not yet deliver intended outcomes. Maintaining Fellowship designation, regulatory requirements, and a desire to remain up-to-date were indicated as the primary motivators for engaging in MOC. The program has had a modest influence on users’ approach to lifelong learning (“neither agree nor disagree”). Discussion: The program redesign reduced the perceived complexity of the MOC framework however it is described by some, as additional work (an add-on) by necessitating the documentation of participation in learning activities. An important “disconnect” between the program purposes and how physicians operationalize engagement was also illuminated by our study. Further attention needs to be paid to shifting the culture of continuing professional development to one that enables physicians to sufficiently demonstrate their continuing competence and enhanced performance meaningfully through participation in MOC programs. © 2016 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038355540"

DSMTs are increasingly used to facilitate learning across the continuum of health professional education (HPE). Given the diverse characteristics of DSMTs and the formal, informal, and nonformal nature of health professional learning, a review of the literature on DSMTs and HPE could inform more effective adoption and usage by regulatory organizations, educators, and learners. Methods: A scoping review of the literature was performed to explore the effectiveness and implications of adopting and using DSMTs across the educational continuum in HPE. A data extraction tool was used to review and analyze 125 peer-reviewed articles. Common themes were identified by thematic analysis. Results: Most articles (56.0%) related to undergraduate education; 31.2% to continuing professional development, and 52.8% to graduate/postgraduate education. The main DSMTs described include mobile phones, apps, tablets, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Approximately half of the articles (49.6%) reported evaluative outcomes at a satisfaction/reaction level; 45.6% were commentaries, reporting no evaluative outcomes. Most studies reporting evaluative outcomes suggest that learners across all levels are typically satisfied with the use of DSMTs in their learning. Thematic analysis revealed three main themes: use of DSMTs across the HPE continuum; key benefits and barriers; and best practices. Discussion: Despite the positive commentary on the potential benefits and opportunities for enhancing teaching and learning in HPE with DSMTs, there is limited evidence at this time that demonstrates effectiveness of DSMTs at higher evaluative outcome levels. Further exploration of the learning benefits and effectiveness of DSMTs for teaching and learning in HPE is warranted.

Methods: The RAC Communiqué is a PEM that contains case narratives from Coroners' investigations into potentially preventable deaths in nursing homes. A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted, using an anonymous electronic survey distributed to all subscribers of the RAC Communiqué. The questionnaire consisted of 40 questions in five sections, such as respondent characteristics, respondent preferences and reading behavior, respondent opinion about the RAC Communiqué content, and the mode of its delivery, impact of the RAC Communiqué, and the details of changes in professional practice. Results: The response rate was 58.3% (367/630). Respondents were mostly women aged 45 years and older (n = 319, 86.9%) with more than 10 years of experience (n = 241, 65.7%) in management (n = 171, 46.6%) or nursing (n = 65, 17.7%).

Reasons include the emotional impact on clinicians and limited knowledge of systems thinking in establishing why events happen and formulating improvements. To enhance SEA effectiveness, we developed and tested “guiding tools” based on human factors principles. Methods: Mixed-methods development of guiding tools (Personal Booklet—to help with emotional demands and apply a human factors analysis at the individual level; Desk Pad—to guide a team-based systems analysis; and a written Report Format) by a multiprofessional “expert” group and testing with Scottish primary care practitioners who submitted completed enhanced SEA reports. Evaluation data were collected through questionnaire, telephone interviews, and thematic analysis of SEA reports. Results: Overall, 149/240 care practitioners tested the guiding tools and submitted completed SEA reports (62.1%). Reported understanding of how to undertake SEA improved postintervention (P < .001), while most agreed that the Personal Booklet was practical (88/123, 71.5%) and relevant to dealing with related emotions (93/123, 75.6%). The Desk Pad tool helped focus the SEA on systems issues (85/123, 69.1%), while most found the Report Format clear (94/123, 76.4%) and would recommend it (88/123, 71.5%). Most SEA reports adopted a systems approach to analyses (125/149, 83.9%), care improvement (74/149, 49.7), or planned actions (42/149, 28.2%). Discussion: Applying human factors principles to SEA potentially enables care teams to gain a systems-based understanding of why things go wrong, which may help with related emotional demands and with more effective learning and improvement.

Methods: Guided by the theory of planned behavior (TPB), predictors of intention to provide survivorship care, including credentials, experience, perception of barriers, and personal survivorship status, were evaluated using logistic regression with a cohort of physicians, nurse practitioners, and registered nurses participating in an unprecedented online continuing medical education/continuing education survivorship care course. Results: Results showed that physicians were significantly less likely to express intent to provide survivorship care (odds ratio [OR] = .237, p = .0001) compared to the other groups. Overall, clinicians with 6-10 years of experience were 3 times more likely to express intent to provide survivorship care (OR = 2.86, p = .045) than those with less or more experience. When clinicians perceived the presence of a barrier, they were nearly twice as likely to have diminished intent (OR = 1.89, p = .035). Most participants (66%; n = 1185) selected two barriers: lack of survivorship care plans and treatment summaries (45.4%; n = 821) and lack of education (20.1%; n = 364). Discussion: Barriers to the delivery of survivorship care can influence clinicians' intention to provide survivorship care, which varied by years of experience in this study. Interdisciplinary educational strategies featuring midcareer provider champions who have successfully incorporated survivorship care and can offer specific solutions to these barriers are recommended for future interventions. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on Continuing Medical Education, Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925014964"

It supports the integration of best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values into the decision-making process for patient care. Competence in this process is essential to delivery of optimal care. There is no objective tool that assesses EBDM across HCP groups. This research aimed to develop a content valid tool to assess knowledge of the principles of evidence-based medicine and the EBDM process, for use with all HCPs. Methods: A Delphi process was used in the creation of the tool. Pilot testing established its content validity with the added benefit of evaluating HCPs’ knowledge of EBDM. Descriptive statistics and multivariate mixed models were used to evaluate individual survey responses in total, as well as within each EBDM component. Results: The tool consisted of 26 multiple-choice questions. A total of 12,884 HCPs in Nova Scotia were invited to participate in the web-based validation study, yielding 818 (6.3%) participants, 471 of whom completed all questions. The mean overall score was 68%. Knowledge in one component, integration of evidence with clinical expertise and patient preferences, was identified as needing development across all HCPs surveyed. Discussion: A content valid tool for assessing HCP EBDM knowledge was created and can be used to support the development of continuing education programs to enhance EBDM competency.

Therefore, contemporary pharmaceutical care requires an effective and sustainable system for pharmacists to maintain and improve competencies. Although motivation plays an important role both as a facilitator (desire to learn) and a barrier (lack of motivation), there is little investigated about this specific factor. The aim of the study was to explore what factors influence pharmacists’ participation in CE with a focus on motivation. Methods: The theoretical framework was self-determination theory (SDT), which describes autonomous motivation (AM) representing motivation from an internal locus of causality, controlled motivation (CM) originating from an external locus of causality, and relative autonomous motivation (RAM) that measures the AM in an individual after correcting for the CM. The relationship between pharmacists’ characteristics, especially their motivation (AM, CM and RAM) in CE, and their participation in CE activities was explored using the AMS-questionnaire and the Dutch online portfolio system. Results: RAM was positively correlated with CE participation of pharmacists and explained 7.8% of the variance. The correlations between the independent variables AM and CM and CE hours were negative (20.301 and 20.476, respectively). Other factors influencing CE participation were pharmacy school (6.8%), traineeship (10.9%), and work experience (7.8%). Pharmacists participated for 27.0 hours on average in CE during 11 months and preferred face-to-face-learning (85.5%) above e-learning (13.8%). Discussion: Our findings show a positive relationship between RAM and CE participation. The current CE system is probably not conducive to stimulation of AM. Further research is needed to understand the factors that stimulate pharmacists’ motivation and participation in CE.

In response, a team of health academics at an Australian university developed and evaluated the continuing education Graduate Certificate in Health Professional Education Program using an interprofessional learning model. Methods: The model was informed by Collins interactional expertise and Knowles adult learning theories. The team collaboratively developed and taught four courses in the program. Blended learning methods such as web-based learning, face-to-face workshops, and online discussion forums were used. Twenty-seven multidisciplinary participants enrolled in the inaugural program. Focus group interview, self-report questionnaires, and teacher observations were used to evaluate the program. Results: Online learning motivated participants to learn in a collaborative virtual environment. The workshops conducted in an interprofessional environment promoted knowledge sharing and helped participants to better understand other discipline roles, so they could conduct clinical education within a broader health care team context. Work-integrated assessments supported learning relevance. The teachers, however, observed that some participants struggled because of lack of computer skills. Discussion: Although the interprofessional learning model promoted collaboration and flexibility, it is important to note that consideration be given to participants who are not computer literate. We therefore conducted a library and computer literacy workshop in orientation week which helped. An interprofessional learning environment can assist health professionals to operate outside their “traditional silos” leading to a more collaborative approach to the provision of care. Our experience may assist other organizations in developing similar programs.

CPD is essential in efforts to ensure effectiveness of new models of health care delivery, improve outcomes and value in health care, address external regulations, and foster patient engagement. The unique features of CPD; the use of special mastery-based teaching, learning, and assessment methods, and other special interventions to promote excellence; and direct involvement of a variety of key stakeholders differentiate CPD from undergraduate medical education and graduate medical education. The needs of procedural specialties relating to CPD are different from those of primary care disciplines and require special attention for the greatest impact. Simulation-based education and training can be very useful in CPD aimed at improving outcomes and promoting patient safety. Preceptoring, proctoring, mentoring, and coaching should be used routinely to address specific needs in CPD. Distinct CPD strategies are necessary for retraining, reentry, and remediation. Participation in CPD programs can be encouraged by leveraging the joy of learning, which should drive physicians and surgeons to strive continually to be the best in their professional work.

Individual competence is conceptualized as a stable possession that, once acquired, holds across contexts. Individual competence is necessary; however, it is insufficient for quality health care. We also need to attend to collective competence in order to grapple with paradoxical truths about teamwork, such as: competent individuals can form incompetent teams. Collective competence is conceptualized as a distributed capacity of a system, an evolving, relational phenomenon that emerges from the resources and constraints of particular contexts. This article outlines a set of paradoxical truths about teamwork in health care and uses the concept of collective competence to explain how they can hold true. It then considers a set of persistent myths about teamwork which have their roots in an individualist orientation, exploring how they hold us back from meaningful change in how we educate for, and practice as, health care teams. Finally, the article briefly considers the implications of these truths and myths for educational issues such as interprofessional education and competency-based health professional education. © 2016 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034802556"

Improvements in the way practicing physicians are taught so as to optimally perform differential diagnosis can increase patient safety and lower the costs of care. This study represents a comparison of the effectiveness of two approaches to CME training directed at improving the primary care practitioner's diagnostic capabilities against seven common and important causes of joint pain. Methods: Using a convenience sampling methodology, one group of primary care practitioners was trained by a traditional live, expert-led, multimedia-based training activity supplemented with interactive practice opportunities and feedback (control group). The second group was trained online with a multimedia-based training activity supplemented with interactive practice opportunities and feedback delivered by an artificial intelligence-driven simulation/tutor (treatment group). Results: Before their respective instructional intervention, there were no significant differences in the diagnostic performance of the two groups against a battery of case vignettes presenting with joint pain. Using the same battery of case vignettes to assess postintervention diagnostic performance, there was a slight but not statistically significant improvement in the control group's diagnostic accuracy (P = .13). The treatment group, however, demonstrated a significant improvement in accuracy (P < .02; Cohen d, effect size = 0.79). Discussion: These data indicate that within the context of a CME activity, a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy can be achieved by the use of a web-delivered, multimedia-based instructional activity supplemented by practice opportunities and feedback delivered by an artificial intelligence-driven simulation/tutor.

Today it is now clear that new areas of focus, such as interprofessional teamwork, care coordination, quality improvement, system science, health information technology, patient safety, assessment of clinical practice, and effective use of clinical decision supports are essential to 21st century medical practice. These areas of need helped to spawn an intense interest in competency-based models of professional education at the turn of this century. However, many of today’s practicing health professionals were never educated in these newer competencies during their own training. Co-production and co-creation of learning among interprofessional health care professionals across the continuum can help close the gap in acquiring needed competencies for health care today and tomorrow. Co-learning may be a particularly effective strategy to help organizations achieve the triple aim of better population health, better health care, and lower costs. Structured frameworks, such as the Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence (SQUIRE) guidelines, provide guidance in the design, planning, and dissemination of interventions designed to improve care through co-production and co-learning strategies.

This report, part of a larger initiative to disseminate evidence summaries of systematic reviews, demonstrates the feasibility of disseminating a comparative effectiveness module to physicians using peer detailers and examines the development of faculty for this process. We describe planning and implementation of a train-the-detailer session, detailer reactions to the process, and results of the dissemination project. Methods: We recruited 10 experienced primary care clinical faculties in Family and Social Medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Detailers attended a 90-minute train-the-detailer session and detailed 150 practitioners at community practices. We evaluated the experiences of the learners and detailers with questionnaires, a focus group, and individual interviews of the detailers. Results: The experiences of detailing in different contexts were uniformly positive. Learners felt the materials were valuable, and that they would implement them or already had implemented them. In the postsurvey completed by 65 of the 150 detailed learners, 97% percent stated that they changed their practice or had already incorporated the practice change before the detailing. All detailers reported a change in their own practice. Detailers found the teaching materials and detailers’ guide helpful. Some initially expressed a concern about not knowing enough, which lessened with detailing experience. Discussion: Peer detailing seems doable and well received, especially with the availability of high quality, previously prepared, and tested evidence-based content and materials. Detailers were easily recruited and trained to apply their teaching skills in this new format. The amount of time spent in training sessions on detailing training as opposed to content mastery can be adjusted depending on faculty needs. © 2016 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.

Methods: Thirteen syllabi from annual refresher continuing medical education (CME) events offered to family physicians in Canada were collected and their session titles and descriptions entered into a database. Titles and descriptions were coded using the International Classification for Primary Care version 2 (ICPC-2). Titles and descriptions were further coded depending on whether the sessions involved a drug treatment/medication component. Syllabi content was compared to previously determined questions asked by physicians at the point of care. Results: Of the original 701 session titles, 625 (89.2%) were suitable for analysis. CME sessions focused on musculoskeletal, digestive, skin, urologic, and general categories were underrepresented in comparison to point-of-care questions. The reverse was true for the psychological/mental health category. Discussion: Differences between questions asked by physicians at the point of care and the content of contemporaneous CME refresher courses can be analyzed to identify gaps in CME offerings. This knowledge could be used to develop CME curricula and highlight areas of need for inclusion in refresher courses. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on Continuing Medical Education, Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925004902"

Novel education methods, specifically the ""flipped classroom"" (FC) and ""train-the-trainer"" (TTT), have the potential to address these delirium training gaps. This study evaluates the effect of a TTT FC interprofessional delirium training program on participants' perceived ability to manage delirium, delirium knowledge, and clinicians' delirium assessment behaviors. Methods: FC Delirium TTT sessions were implemented in a large four-hospital network and consisted of presession online work and a 3-hour in-session component. The 156 TTT interprofessional participants who attended the sessions (ie, trainers) were expected to then deliver delirium training to their patient care units. Delirium care self-efficacy and knowledge test scores were measured before, after, and 6 months after the training session. Clinician delirium assessment rates were measured by chart audits before and 3 months after trainer's implementation of delirium training sessions. Results: Delirium knowledge test scores (7.8 ± 1.6 versus 9.7 ± 1.2, P < .001) and delirium care self-efficacy were significantly higher immediately after the TTT session compared with those of presession and these differences remained significant at 6-month after the TTT session. Trainer sessions significantly improved clinician delirium assessment rates from 53% for pretraining to 66% for posttraining. Discussion: Our data suggest that a TTT FC delirium training approach can improve participants' perceived delirium care skills and confidence, and delirium knowledge up to 6 months after the session. This approach provides a model for implementing hospitalwide delirium education that can change delirium assessment behavior while minimizing time and personnel requirements.

The main purpose of this study was to explore the relationships between pharmacists’ Internet self-efficacy (ISE) and their SRL in online continuing education. Methods: A total of 164 in-service pharmacists in Taiwan were surveyed with the Internet Self-Efficacy Survey, including basic ISE (B-ISE), advanced ISE (A-ISE) and professional ISE (P-ISE), as well as the Self-Regulated Learning Questionnaire consisting of preparatory SRL (P-SRL) and enactment SRL (E-SRL). Results: Results of a 1-by-3 (educational levels: junior college versus bachelor versus master) analysis of variance and a 1-by-4 (institutions: community-based versus hospital versus clinic versus company) analysis of variance revealed that there were differences in ISE and SRL among different education levels and working institutions. The hierarchical regression analyses indicated that B-ISE and P-ISE were significant predictors of P-SRL, whereas P-ISE was a critical predictor of E-SRL. Moreover, the interaction of P-ISE · age was linked to E-SRL, implying that P-ISE has a stronger influence on E-SRL for older pharmacists than for younger pharmacists. However, the interactions between age and ISE (A-ISE, B-ISE, and P-ISE) were not related to P-SRL. Discussion: This study highlighted the importance of ISE and age for increasing pharmacists’ SRL in online continuing education. © 2016 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.

Whether participation in quality improvement (QI) through Maintenance of Certification for Family Physicians Performance in Practice Modules (PPMs) is useful and results in practice change remains unknown. Methods: All PPM feedback data from inception to April 2014 were analyzed using descriptive statistics by year, topic, and number of PPMs completed. Qualitative content analysis was applied to analyze responses to open-ended questions on practice changes. Results: Of note, 29,755 diplomates completed 38,201 PPMs; median 1 interquartile range (1, 1). Nearly two-thirds (65.8%, n = 25,150) of PPMs had completed feedback surveys. Of note, 78.7% of respondents indicated that they would change patient care and 90.2% indicated that they would continue QI activities after completing the PPM. Respondents endorsed high relevance to practice (90.5%), high currency of clinical information (86.4%), and high usefulness of clinical information (80.5%). When feedback was analyzed by the number of PPMs completed, respondents were less likely to change care but reported increased usefulness to practice and stable intention to continue QI efforts with more PPMs completed. Of note, 86.0% of respondents who said that they would change care provided examples: these varied by PPM topic but ""doing more,"" focusing on patients, and education were common. Discussion: These findings suggest that QI completed through the PPMs may assist family physicians in improving the care they provide. Furthermore, ratings by the number of PPMs completed suggest that repeated exposure to QI efforts produce continued relevance and usefulness, even when changes in practice decline.

Evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI), which involves adapting evidencebased practices to meet local needs, may improve uptake and effectiveness of a variety of health care innovations. Yet, to our knowledge, EBQI has not yet been applied to cultural competence training. To evaluate whether EBQI could enhance the impact of an evidence-based training intended to improve veterans affairs health care staff gender sensitivity and knowledge (Caring for Women Veterans; CWV), we compared the reach and effectiveness of EBQI delivery versus standard web-based implementation strategies of CWV and assessed barriers and facilitators to EBQI implementation. Methods: Workgroups at four diverse veterans affairs health care sites were randomized to either an EBQI or standard web-based implementation condition (SI). All EBQI sites selected a group-based implementation strategy. Employees (N = 84) completed pretraining and posttraining assessments of gender sensitivity and knowledge, and focus groups/interviews were conducted with leadership and staff before and after implementation. Results: Reach of CWV was greater in the EBQI condition versus the SI condition. Whereas both gender sensitivity and knowledge improved in the EBQI condition, only gender sensitivity improved in the SI condition. Qualitative analyses revealed that the EBQI approach was well received, although a number of barriers were identified. Discussion: Findings suggest that EBQI can enhance the uptake and effectiveness of employee trainings. However, the decision to pursue EBQI must be informed by a consideration of available resources. © 2016 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.

However, little is known about the relationships between reflection and behavior change in CME. Our objectives were to measure associations between validated reflection scores and behavior change among CME participants and to identify associations between reflection and characteristics of CME presentations. Methods: This was a cohort study of attendees at a national hospital medicine CME course. Participants provided reflection scores for each presentation and planned commitment-to-change (CTC) statements at the conclusion of the course. Reflection scores from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) were averaged for each presentation. CTC statements were linked to their accompanying presentations. A 3-month postcourse survey was conducted to assess if planned CTCs were successfully implemented. Results: In all, 223 of 281 participants (79.4%) returned evaluations. Of the 195 planned CTC statements available for postcourse analysis, 128 (65.6%) were implemented. Reflection scores correlated with the number of planned CTC statements across all presentations (Pearson correlation, 0.65; P < .001). In addition, higher reflection scores (mean [SD]) were associated with the presence of audience response opportunities (Yes: 4.13 [0.18] versus No: 3.96 [0.16]; P = .01) and the use of clinical cases (Yes: 4.09 [0.18] versus No: 3.86 [0.12]; P < .01). Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to show a relationship between participant reflection and CTC in conferencebased CME. Presentations that incorporate clinical cases and audience response systems seem to stimulate participant reflection and behavior change. © 2017 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049089829"

The purpose of this study was to explore physician's perceptions of their access to assessment activities, barriers to participation in assessment, and the need for the Royal College to further support its fellows in gaining access to assessment activities. Methods: A questionnaire-based survey was sent to all participants of the MOC program as part of a program evaluation examining recent changes to the MOC program. Results: 5259 respondents contributed responses. Most physicians were comfortable with the revised framework for assessment while approximately 40% were neutral regarding whether lack of access to self-assessment activities was a problem. Respondents expressed a need for more self-assessment programs particularly those developed outside of Canada. Neither a lack of feedback about performance or discomfort with recording performance gaps was perceived as a barrier to participation in assessment activities. Physician comments were consistent with the quantitative data and elaborated on the need to develop and recognize more assessment activities. Discussion: Physicians accepted the revised MOC program framework but perceived difficulty in accessing assessment programs, activities, and tools. As the framework changed again January 2014, requiring all fellows and MOC program participants to completion of at least 25 credits in each section of the MOC program (including assessment) during their new 5-year MOC cycle, additional resources will be needed to support opportunities for physicians to engage in assessment. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on Continuing Medical Education, Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924995326"

Method: A multicenter single-blinded controlled trial involving pharmacists at 2 metropolitan teaching hospitals was used for this investigation. Pharmacists were allocated to either (a) an interactive presentation incorporating multiple-choice questions (MCQs) answered using an ARS, or (b) the same, but noninteractive, presentation using summary points instead of MCQs. Baseline knowledge was evaluated using a 10-item questionnaire, which was also used to evaluate immediate and long-term (6 weeks later) knowledge acquisition. Learner reactions were evaluated through feedback questionnaires. Results: The control and ARS intervention presentations were attended by 44 and 35 pharmacists, respectively. The 6-week follow-up questionnaire was completed by 35 control (80%) and 27 (77%) ARS group participants. Baseline knowledge was similar across groups (5.0 ± 1.6 SD vs 5.2 ± 1.6; p = .44) with no differences in immediate (8.3 ± 1.5 vs 7.9 ± 1.5; p = 0.30) or long-term (7.0 ± 1.6 vs 7.0 ± 1.5; p = 0.93) knowledge acquisition. Feedback regarding the use of an ARS was overwhelmingly positive, with participants feeling more strongly that the ARS enabled them to compare knowledge to that of their peers (p < .001). Discussion: There was no observed benefit of an ARS in relation to immediate or long-term knowledge acquisition. The use of an ARS, however, appeared to facilitate enhanced interactivity and participant self-reflection of knowledge, with strong participant desire to continue their use in future CE activities. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on Continuing Medical Education, Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924989690"

The TEAM (Teamwork Effectiveness Assessment Module) is a new Web-based teamwork assessment module for practicing hospital physicians. The module combines self-assessment, multisource feedback from members of other professions and specialties with whom the physician exercises teamwork, and a structured review of those data with a peer to develop an improvement plan. Methods: We conducted a pilot test of this module with hospitalist physicians to evaluate the feasibility and usefulness of the module in practice, focusing on these specific questions: Would physicians in hospitals of different types and sizes be able to use the module; would the providers identified as raters respond to the request for feedback; would the physicians be able to identify one or more ""trusted peers"" to help analyze the feedback; and how would physicians experience the module process overall? Results: 20 of 25 physicians who initially volunteered for the pilot completed all steps of the TEAM, including identifying interprofessional teammates, soliciting feedback from their team, and identifying a peer to help review data. Module users described the feedback they received as helpful and actionable, and indicated this was information they would not have otherwise received. Conclusions: The results suggest that a module combining self-assessment, multisource feedback, and a guided process for interpreting these data can provide help practicing hospital physicians to understand and potentially improve their interprofessional teamwork skills and behaviors. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on Continuing Medical Education, Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924987392"

Research results to date are mixed with some studies finding negative associations between age and various measures of competency and others finding no or minimal relationships. Methods: Four groups of multiple choice test items that were independently developed for certification and MOC examinations in psychiatry and neurology were administered to certification and MOC examinees within each specialty. Percent correct scores were calculated for each examinee. Differences between certification and MOC examinees were compared using unpaired t tests, and logistic regression was used to compare MOC and certification examinee performance on the common test items. Results: Except for the neurology certification test items that addressed basic neurology concepts, the performance of the certification and MOC examinees was similar. The differences in performance on individual test items did not consistently favor one group or the other and could not be attributed to any distinguishable content or format characteristics of those items. Discussion: The findings of this study are encouraging in that physicians who had recently completed residency training possessed clinical knowledge that was comparable to that of experienced physicians, and the experienced physicians’ clinical knowledge was equivalent to that of recent residency graduates.

Some hospitals and health systems have initiated age-based screening, but there is no agreed upon assessment process. Licensing and certifying organizations generally do not require that senior physicians pass additional assessments of health, competency, or quality performance. Studies suggest that physician performance, on average, declines with increasing years in medical practice, but the effect of age on an individual physician's competence is highly variable. Many senior physicians practice effectively and should be allowed to remain in practice as long as quality and safety are not endangered. Stakeholders in the medical profession should consider the need to develop guidelines and methods for monitoring and/or screening to ensure that senior physicians provide safe and effective care for patients. Any screening process needs to achieve a balance between protecting patients from harm due to substandard practice, while at the same time ensuring fairness to physicians and avoiding unnecessary reductions in workforce.

This attention to patient safety has highlighted the importance of a learning approach and a systems approach to quality measurement and improvement. Balanced with the need for public disclosure of performance, confidential reporting with feedback is one of the prime ways that nations such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia have approached this challenge. In the United States, the Quality Interagency Coordination Task Force has convened federal agencies that are involved in health care quality improvement for a coordinated initiative. Based on an investment in a strong research foundation in health care quality measurement and improvement, there are eight key lessons for continuing education if it is to parlay the interest in patient safety into enhanced continuing education and quality improvement in learning health care systems. The themes for these lessons are (1) informatics for information, (2) guidelines as learning tools, (3) learning from opinion leaders, (4) learning from the patient, (5) decision support systems, (6) the team learning together, (7) learning organizations, and (8) just-in-time and point-of care delivery.

As such, there is a need for effective, valid tools and processes to accurately assess and identify deficiencies in competence or performance. Although scores on multiple-choice questions have been shown to be predictive of some aspects of physician performance in practicing physicians, their relationship to overall clinical competence is somewhat uncertain particularly after the first 10 years of practice. As such, the purpose of this study was to examine how a general medical knowledge multiple-choice question examination is associated with a comprehensive assessment of competence and performance in experienced practicing physicians with potential competence and performance deficiencies. Methods: The study included 233 physicians, of varying specialties, assessed by the University of California, San Diego Physician Assessment and Clinical Education Program (PACE), between 2008 and 2012, who completed the Post-Licensure Assessment System Mechanisms of Disease (MoD) examination. Logistic regression determined if the examination score significantly predicted passing assessment outcome after correcting for gender, international medical graduate status, certification status, and age. Results: Most physicians (89.7%) received an overall passing assessment outcome on the PACE assessment. The mean MoD score was 66.9% correct, with a median of 68.0%. Logistic regression (P = .038) was significant in indicating that physicians with higher MoD examination scores had an increased likelihood of achieving a passing assessment outcome (odds ratio = 1.057). Discussion: Physician MoD scores are significant predictors of overall physician competence and performance as evaluated by PACE assessment. © 2016 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.

Substantive equivalency is intended to support the mobility of learners, allowing them to access accredited learning activities that are recognized by various CPD accreditation systems in a manner that maximizes the value of those accreditation systems, while minimizing the burden of adhering to their requirements. In this article, we propose a set of core principles that all CPD accreditation systems must express as the basis for determining substantive equivalency between CPD accreditation systems. The article will illustrate how five CPD accreditation systems (two in the USA, two in Canada, and one in Qatar), differing in focus (activity-based versus provider-based), context, and culture, express these values and metrics, and concludes by identifying the value of substantive equivalency for learners, medical regulators, and CPD accreditation systems.

Barriers include lack of awareness, familiarity, and access. Efforts to promote utilization have focused on reaching practicing clinicians, leaving unexplored the roles of continuing medical education (CME) directors and faculty in promoting systematic review use. This study explored the feasibility of working with CME directors and faculty for that purpose. Methods: A convenience sample of five academic CME directors and faculty agreed to participate in a feasibility study exploring use in CME courses of systematic reviews from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ-SRs). AHRQ-SR topics addressed the comparative effectiveness of health care options. Participants received access to AHRQ-SR reports, associated summary products, and instructional resources. The feasibility study used mixed methods to assess 1) implementation of courses incorporating SR evidence, 2) identification of facilitators and barriers to integration, and 3) acceptability to CME directors, faculty, and learners. Results: Faculty implemented 14 CME courses of varying formats serving 1700 learners in urban, suburban, and rural settings. Facilitators included credibility, conciseness of messages, and availability of supporting materials; potential barriers included faculty unfamiliarity with SRs, challenges in maintaining review currency, and review scope. SR evidence and summary products proved acceptable to CME directors, course faculty, and learners by multiple measures. Discussion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of approaches to use AHRQ-SRs in CME courses/programming. Further research is needed to demonstrate generalizability to other types of CME providers and other systemic reviews. © 2016 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.

We describe the development of a self-rated mixed methods skills assessment and provide validity evidence. The instrument taps six research domains: “Research question,” “Design/approach,” “Sampling,” “Data collection,” “Analysis,” and “Dissemination.” Respondents are asked to rate their ability to define or explain concepts of mixed methods under each domain, their ability to apply the concepts to problems, and the extent to which they need to improve. Methods: We administered the questionnaire to 145 faculty and students using an internet survey. We analyzed descriptive statistics and performance characteristics of the questionnaire using the Cronbach alpha to assess reliability and an analysis of variance that compared a mixed methods experience index with assessment scores to assess criterion relatedness. Results: Internal consistency reliability was high for the total set of items (0.95) and adequate (≥0.71) for all but one subscale. Consistent with establishing criterion validity, respondents who had more professional experiences with mixed methods (eg, published a mixed methods article) rated themselves as more skilled, which was statistically significant across the research domains. Discussion: This self-rated mixed methods assessment instrument may be a useful tool to assess skills in mixed methods for training programs. It can be applied widely at the graduate and faculty level. For the learner, assessment may lead to enhanced motivation to learn and training focused on self-identified needs. For faculty, the assessment may improve curriculum and course content planning. © 2017 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021097176"

We define collaborative clinical reasoning (CCR) as the process in which two or more health care team members negotiate diagnostic, therapeutic, or prognostic issues of an individual patient resulting in an illness or treatment plan (and to reduce uncertainty). In a systematic review, we aimed to answer the following research question: Which empirically observable factors are considered crucial influences on performance in CCR in current empirical research? Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted. We included empirical studies taking place in a hospital setting, with a clear focus on CCR and published between January 1990 and September 2014. The studies were only included when at least one physician was part of the team. Nine articles were included in the review. Results: The factors crucially influencing the CCR performance (ie, diagnosis or treatment plan of patients) are (1) the initial distribution of information over team members, (2) clinical experience of physicians within a team, (3) information exchange within a team, and (4) individual retrieval of information from the team or information representation. Discussion: Despite the sparse empirical evidence on CCR, four factors influencing performance were extracted from the literature. Overall, there is little evidence though how each of these factors actually influences CCR performance. Thus, we need more empirical studies to better understand and foster CCR performance. © 2017 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021075421"

The purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions of psychiatry residents and faculty about LLL implementation, motivation, and training needs. Methods: This qualitative study was conducted in a large, urban, multisite psychiatry training program as part of a larger mixed methods study of LLL in psychiatry education. Using a purposive sampling approach, psychiatry residents were recruited to participate in focus groups; early career psychiatrists and psychiatry educators were recruited to participate in semistructured interviews. Content analysis of interviews and focus groups was done using the iterative, inductive method of constant comparative analysis. Results: Of the 34 individuals participating in the study, 23 were residents, six were psychiatry educators, and five were early career psychiatrists. Three predominant themes were identified in participants’ transcripts related to (1) the need for LLL training in residency training; (2) the implementation of LLL in residency training and practice; and (3) the spectrum of motivation for LLL from residency training into practice. Discussion: This study identified the lack of preparation for LLL in residency training and the impact of this gap for psychiatrists transitioning into practice. All participants described the importance of integrating LLL training within clinical rotations and the importance of grounding LLL within the clinical workplace early in residency training to support the delivery of effective, high-quality patient care. © 2017 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021132666"

The main aim of this study was to propose a competency framework and questionnaire used to conduct a needs analysis to identify and prioritize family physicians’ real educational needs regarding the health impacts of CC. Methods: A mixed method combining a qualitative interview and a quantitative online questionnaire was used (n = 24 physicians). The interview assessed key beliefs related to participating in an online continuing medical education (eCME) activity on the health impacts of climate change, and the perception of the key factors or conditions required to ensure the family physicians’ satisfaction with this eCME activity. The questionnaire assessed the current and desired levels of competency on five general training themes: general knowledge about CC; heat-related illnesses; CC, extreme weather events and modification of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases; CC, extreme weather events and modification of water-borne diseases; and mental health impacts of natural disasters. Results: Results revealed the need for improved medical education on climate change and health. Results also add to the literature by showing that a 3-hour eCME activity covering these topics would be useful and would allow family physicians to use this knowledge in their daily practice, notably through prevention and counseling. Discussion: Introducing a CME needs assessment framework and a generic instrument that reflects family physicians’ needs regarding the health impacts of CC has the added advantage of standardizing the assessment procedure.

The aim of this study was to identify whether and how an outreach program targeting interprofessional health care teams can improve self-efficacy and interprofessional collaboration (IPC). Methods: A cohort study was conducted to explore the effect of the program on individual self-efficacy and perceived IPC and investigate factors affecting interprofessional learning and collaboration. The program was a two-year IPE program consisting of workshops, educational materials, and interworkshop support. Participants were physicians, nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, and social workers at two primary care teams in Toronto. Self-efficacy and team function were measured five times throughout the program. We used analysis of variance and t-tests to compare between teams and used Pearson correlations to estimate the relationship between self-efficacy and team function. One-on-one interviews investigated factors affecting IPC and the program's effect on IPC. Results: Team function improved as the program progressed (P = .02); although it did not affect self-efficacy, there was an increasing correlation between self-efficacy and team function as the program progressed (P < .01 for workshop 5). Interviews revealed that trust, liability concerns, and geographic proximity were mediators of IPC. The workshops were perceived to enable trust building by increasing knowledge and allowing nonphysician team members to showcase their expertise. Discussion: Our findings demonstrate that an IPE workshop, through role clarification, cultivation of trust, and a community of practice, can promote these elements. Trust in team members and geographic proximity are potential facilitators to IPC developed during an interprofessional program.

We explored knowledge of these terms among clinical faculty who instruct and mentor a continuum of medical learners to inform medical faculty learning needs. Methods: This was a mixed methods study that used a questionnaire to measure a health professional’s understanding of measures of treatment effect and a focus group to explore perspectives on learning, applying, and teaching these terms. We analyzed questionnaire data using descriptive statistics and focus group data using thematic analysis. Results: We analyzed responses from clinical faculty who were physicians and completed all sections of the questionnaire (n = 137). Overall, approximately 55% were highly confident in their understanding of statistical terms; self-reported understanding was highest for number needed to treat (77%). Only 26% of respondents correctly responded to all comprehension questions; however, 80% correctly responded to at least one of these questions. There was a significant association among self-reported understanding and ability to correctly calculate terms. A focus group with clinical/medical faculty (n = 4) revealed themes of mentorship, support and resources, and beliefs about the value of statistical literacy. Discussion: We found that half of clinical faculty members are highly confident in their understanding of relative and absolute terms. Despite the limitations of self-assessment data, our study provides some evidence that self-assessment can be reliable. Recognizing that faculty development is not mandatory for clinical faculty in many centers, and the notion that faculty may benefit from mentorship in critical appraisal topics, it may be appropriate to first engage and support influential clinical faculty rather than using a broad strategy to achieve universal statistical literacy. Second, senior leadership in medical education should support continuous learning by providing paid, protected time for faculty to incorporate evidence in their teaching. © 2016 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006377809"

Printed educational materials (PEMs), which synthesize evidence, are often ineffective at improving knowledge, possibly due to poor design and limited uptake. In this study, we collected PCP preferences for the design and content of physician-oriented PEMs and determined key attributes that may increase their usability and uptake. Methods: We held 90-minute focus groups with PCPs in Toronto, ON, Canada. Focus groups included discussion about whether and how participants use PEMs, feedback on three examples of PEMs, and a discussion on general format and design preferences in PEMs. We analyzed focus group transcripts using a thematic analysis and summarized results in a list of user preferences. Results: Four focus groups were held with 13 PCPs. We found that participants only read PEMs relevant to their patients and prefer short, concise documents, with links to sources that can provide more detailed information. Simplicity of materials was important, with many participants preferring PEMs without lengthy backgrounds or scientific explanations. Most participants wanted to see key messages highlighted to easily assess the relevance of the materials to their practice. Some participants shared physician-oriented PEMs with patients. Discussion: This study shows that PCPs may prefer shorter, simpler, and more concise documents that have less scientific detail but provide references to further information sources. It is important to understand end user preferences for the design and content of these materials to enhance their uptake. © 2016 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006381108"

Although these practices have been observed in several institutes, careful assessment of top-cited articles may provide more insight into exploring their characteristics. The aim of this study was to analyze the top-cited articles in medical education identified by Azer 2015 and explore the characteristics of these articles that can provide insight into their assessment. Methods: The most frequently cited articles identified by searching the Web of Science under the category “Education, Scientific Discipline” were included in the analysis. The following issues were further analyzed: 1) comparing the mean yearly citations received by articles published before the year 2000 and those published after, 2) assessing whether there was a correlation between the number of grants, number of authors, number of institutes, or number of countries involved and the number of citations received, 3) assessing the number of female representation in authorship, 4) assessing the representation of none-medical staff in the authorship, and 5) exploring any association between top authors identified and those who were awarded the Karolinska Institutet Prize for research in medical education. Results: Although there was no correlation between the number of citations and the number of years since publications, the mean number of citations received by articles published before the year 2000 varied from zero to 18.2 6 16.6, whereas for those published after the year 2000 the mean varied from 2.0 6 2.1 to 35.3 6 26.8. No correlation was found between the number of citations obtained and number of grants, number of authors, number of institutes, or number of countries involved. Females comprised 50% of the total number of authors. However, no correlation was found between the number of females in authorship and the number of citations obtained. Similarly, the number of authors with non-medical degrees did not correlate with the number of citations obtained. An association was found between authoring more than one article in the list and receiving the Karolinska Institutet Prize for research in medical education. Discussion: The analysis shows that the higher number of citations received are not necessarily related to funding, working collaboratively with a big team from several institutes or from several countries. The finding that authors of more than one top-cited article received the Karolinska Institutet Prize for research in medical education indicates that this could be a parameter in selecting the candidates for the award.

Knowledge translation (KT) is a conceptual framework for putting evidence to work in health care. This narrative literature review examined the question: What does the field KT offer, conceptually and practically, for education of health professionals in dementia care? It seeks to identify the types of strategies currently used within education to facilitate effective KT for the wide range of health professionals who may be involved in the care of people with dementia, plus explore enablers and barriers to KT in this context. Methods: From 76 articles identified in academic databases and manual bibliographic searching, 22 met review criteria. Results: The literature synthesis indicated four hallmarks of successful KT-oriented dementia education for health professionals: (1) multimodal delivery, (2) tailored approaches, (3) relationship building, and (4) organizational support for change in the work setting. Participatory action frameworks were also favored, based on interactive knowledge exchange (eg, blended learning) rather than passive unidirectional approaches alone (eg, lectures). Discussion: The following six principles are proposed for educating health professionals in dementia care: (1) Match the education strategy to the KT goal and learner preferences; (2) Use integrated multimodal learning strategies and provide opportunities for multiple learning exposures plus feedback; (3) Build relationships to bridge the research-practice gap; (4) Use a simple compelling message with formats and technologies relevant to the audience; (5) Provide incentives to achieve KT goals; and (6) Plan to change the workplace, not just the individual health professional.

Methods: The teachers were interviewed after they had been observed in both clinical and classroom settings. Results: The study showed the teachers’ reliance on the relational aspects of pedagogy more than on technical pedagogical knowledge. Teachers referred to their aims and approaches as “interactive,” but this does not refer to any deliberate pedagogical design or acts. Asking questions was the technique used most commonly but not always skillfully, and they cited influences from the past rather than the present or the future. Discussion: This research suggests the pedagogic approach of these medical teachers is “humanistic.” It emphasizes personal and interpersonal factors, meaningful learning, and the affective, as well as cognitive aspects of clinical knowledge. It also captures a commitment to nonthreatening, nonhumiliating environments. Acknowledgment of this particular pedagogical perspective, it is argued, could better connect the health professional teachers with the education and development missions of universities, professional bodies, and governments. The teachers’ expressed values and goals offer a new starting point for faculty development. Their reliance on the relational over the technical and on their own biographical experience, could be more respectfully valued and addressed to advance a more productive balance with the technical pedagogical elements that often concern educationalists, researchers, and administrators.

Interprofessional education has been demonstrated in clinical contexts to enhance interprofessional collaboration, patient care, and health outcomes. With curriculum design, teaching methods, and educational strategies in faculty development, it is possible to enhance the impact of IPE in clinical contexts. Faculty development activities themselves can model effective interprofessional education methods and practice. An IPE curriculum and teaching and education strategies are outlined. Strategic planning, including the application of a systems approach, attention to the principles of effective learning, and an outcomes-based curriculum design are recommended for the development of continuing IPE faculty development programs that enhance interprofessional collaboration.

We engaged 21 Harvard Medical School faculty members in our pilot and implementation studies to determine the effectiveness of using FOR training to assess health professionals’ teaching performances. Methods: All faculty were novices at rating their peers’ teaching effectiveness. Before FOR training, we asked participants to evaluate a recorded lecture using a criterion-based peer assessment of medical lecturing instrument. At the start of training, we discussed the instrument and emphasized its precise behavioral standards. During training, participants practiced rating lectures and received immediate feedback on how well they categorized and scored performances as compared with expert-derived scores of the same lectures. At the conclusion of the training, we asked participants to rate a post-training recorded lecture to determine agreement with the experts’ scores. Results: Participants and experts had greater rating agreement for the post-training lecture compared with the pretraining lecture. Through this investigation, we determined that FOR training is a feasible method to teach faculty how to accurately and reliably assess medical lectures. Discussion: Medical school instructors and continuing education presenters should have the opportunity to be observed and receive feedback from trained peer observers. Our results show that it is possible to use FOR rater training to teach peer observers how to accurately rate medical lectures. The process is time efficient and offers the prospect for assessment and feedback beyond traditional learner evaluation of instruction.

We aimed to enhance clinicians' well-being by offering a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) course that teaches mindfulness and stress management and then determine whether this impacted their subsequent medical encounters. Methods: In a longitudinal cohort study with 27 clinicians, MBSR was taught by a certified instructor. Pre-MBSR and post-MBSR online questionnaires assessed burnout, depression, stress, meaningfulness, and mindfulness. Patients independently rated their clinicians using the Rochester Communication Rating Scale (RCRS) after a clinical encounter before and after their clinician took the MBSR course. Nine medical doctors audiorecorded the consultations before and after MBSR; the tapes were coded and analyzed by an independent team using the Roter interaction analyses system. Results: Significant reductions in stress and burnout were found, and increases in mindfulness and meaningfulness. The decrease in stress was correlated with less judgmental attitudes and less reactivity-facets of mindfulness. The decrease in emotional exhaustion was correlated with more acting with awareness and less judgmental attitudes-facets of mindfulness. Patients' perceptions of the clinical encounter suggested that patient-centered care improved after MBSR. Decreased depersonalization was significantly associated with the RCRS subscale, ""understanding of the patient's experience of illness."" At both time points, doctors dominated the exchange and were patient-centered. Discussion: Mindfulness has a direct and positive impact on clinicians' well-being. When clinicians' experienced less depersonalization, their patients reported being better understood.

Using the education of rheumatologists on rheumatoid arthritis management as a model, this study demonstrates how the combined methodology has the ability to not only characterize learning gaps but also identify those proficiency areas that have the greatest impact on clinical behavior. Methods: The meta-analysis included seven curricula with 25 activities. Learners who identified as rheumatologists were evaluated across multiple learning domains, using a uniform methodology to characterize learning gains and gaps. A performance composite variable (called the treatment individualization and optimization score) was then established as a target upon which predictive analytics were conducted. Results: Significant predictors of the target included items related to the knowledge of rheumatologists and confidence concerning 1) treatment guidelines and 2) tests that measure disease activity. In addition, a striking demographic predictor related to geographic practice setting was also identified. Discussion: The results demonstrate the power of advanced analytics to identify key predictors that influence clinical behaviors. Furthermore, the ability to provide an expected magnitude of change if these predictors are addressed has the potential to substantially refine educational priorities to those drivers that, if targeted, will most effectively overcome clinical barriers and lead to the greatest success in achieving treatment goals. © 2016 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006356955"

It is, therefore, an opportune time to critique the UK experience with remediation policy. This article frames, for the first time, the UK remediation policy as developing from a central policy aim that was articulated in the 1990s: to accelerate the identification of underperformance and, subsequently, remedy any problems identified as soon as possible. In pursuit of this aim, three policy trajectories have emerged: professionalizing and standardizing remediation provision; linking remediation with other forms of regulation, namely relicensure (known in the UK as medical revalidation); and fostering obligations for doctors to report themselves and others for remediation needs. The operationalization of policy along these trajectories, and the challenges that have arisen, has relevance for anyone seeking to understand or indeed improve remediation practices within any health care system. It is argued here that the UK serves as an example of the more general challenges posed by seeking to integrate remediation policy within broader frameworks of medical governance, in particular systems of relicensure, and the need to develop a solid evidence base for remediation practices. © 2017 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049111906"

Although these technologies present opportunities for greater ""just-in-time"" information seeking, there are issues for ensuring effective and efficient usage to compliment one’s repertoire for continuous learning. The purpose of this study was to explore the SDL experiences of rural physicians and the potential of DSMTs for supporting their continuing professional development (CPD). Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of rural physicians. Interview data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using NVivo analytical software and thematic analysis. Results: Fourteen (N = 14) interviews were conducted and key thematic categories that emerged included key triggers, methods of undertaking SDL, barriers, and supports. Methods and resources for undertaking SDL have evolved considerably, and rural physicians report greater usage of mobile phones, tablets, and laptop computers for updating their knowledge and skills and in responding to patient questions/problems. Mobile technologies, and some social media, can serve as ""triggers"" in instigating SDL and a greater usage of DSMTs, particularly at ""point of care,"" may result in higher levels of SDL. Social media is met with some scrutiny and ambivalence, mainly because of the ""credibility"" of information and risks associated with digital professionalism. Discussion: DSMTs are growing in popularity as a key resource to support SDL for rural physicians. Mobile technologies are enabling greater ""point-of-care"" learning and more efficient information seeking. Effective use of DSMTs for SDL has implications for enhancing just-in-time learning and quality of care. Increasing use of DSMTs and their new effect on SDL raises the need for reflection on conceptualizations of the SDL process. The ""digital age"" has implications for our CPD credit systems and the roles of CPD providers in supporting SDL using DSMTs. © 2016 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006372224"

The learning model of communities of practice (COPs) is increasingly being used in the field of health care. This study explores the establishment and maintenance of COPs among PCPs in Hong Kong. Methods: Sequential, semi-structured individual interview and focus group interview were conducted to explore the purposes for partaking in continuous learning, as well as barriers and facilitators for attendance among private nonspecialist PCPs in Hong Kong. Data were drawn from the discourses related to COPs. Thematic analysis with constant comparison was performed until data saturation was reached. Results: PCPs voluntarily established COPs to solve clinical problems from the existing networks. Clinical interest, practice orientation, and recruitment of new members through endorsement by the existing members fostered group coherence. Conversation and interaction among members generated the “best” practice with knowledge that was applicable in specific clinical scenarios in primary care setting. COPs rejected commercial sponsorship to minimize corporate influences on learning. Updating medical knowledge, solving clinical problems, maintaining openness, engendering a sense of trust and ownership among members, and fulfilling psychosocial needs were integral to sustainability. Seeking secretariat support to aid in the logistics of meetings, enhancing external learning resources, and facilitation skills training of facilitators from professional bodies may further incentivize members to maintain COPs. Discussion: Autonomy of group learning activities, recruiting specialists and allied health professionals, training facilitators, and undertaking discussion in multimedia may achieve the sustainability of COPs. © 2017 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021155823"

As a result, physicians often find themselves trying to bridge the gap between the chronic pain patient’s expectations and harsh biomedical reality. The typology of Emanuel and Emanuel of four models for the patient–physician relationship is used in this article as a conceptual tool to examine the possible roles of physicians in the context of chronic noncancer pain. Their typology is reconceptualized as a “pathway” along which the physician is able to walk more or less far, starting from the “information” end of the path. The other end of the pathway is “caring deliberation.” I then propose that, in pain medicine today, consumerism is a powerful incentive for physicians to stay at the information end of the spectrum. Against this background, I discuss the current opioid epidemic in the United States and the need for what has been called a new medical professionalism. I conclude by challenging educators involved in pain medicine continuing professional development to not only design adequate biomedical–educational programs, but also consider issues like professionalism, personal development, critical self-reflection, and the ethics of engaging in caring deliberation with chronic pain patients. © 2016 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.

In the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system, women veterans are a numerical minority, preferably assigned to designated women's health primary care providers (DWHPs). DWHPs need to maintain their knowledge and skills in women's health topics, in addition to general internal medicine topics. We explored drivers of VA DWHPs' learning preferences for women's health topics-ie, factors which influence greater and lesser learning interest. Methods: We conducted semistructured telephone interviews with DWHPs across six VA health care systems. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded in ATLAS.ti. We synthesized results by grouping relevant coded sections of text to form emergent themes. Results: Among the 31 DWHPs interviewed, reported drivers of learning interests among women's health topics were (1) high frequency of clinical incidence of particular issues; (2) perceived appropriateness of particular issues for management in primary care settings; and (3) perceived appropriateness of particular issues for partial management in primary care. Lower interest in particular women's health topics was associated with (1) perceived existing competency or recent training in an issue and (2) perceived need for specialty care management of an issue. Discussion: Understanding drivers of DWHPs' CE learning priorities lays a foundation for developing CE programming that will be of interest to women's health primary care providers. Attention to drivers of learning interests may have applicability beyond women's health, suggesting a general approach for CE programming that prioritizes high-volume topics within the practice scope of target providers.

In flipped classrooms, coursework is completed beforehand and applied during class time. Studies of flipped classrooms and their potential benefits in CME have not been published. We sought to develop and validate an instrument measuring flipped classroom perceptions, identify whether participation changed perceptions, and determine which flipped classroom components were perceived as most effective. Methods: In this cross-sectional validation study, 167 participants in the Mayo Clinic’s 2015 Internal Medicine Board Review course received surveys. Online modules were developed to deliver content before flipped classroom courses on acid-base disorders and electrolyte disorders. A flipped classroom perception instrument (FCPI) was developed and validated. The FCPI, with eight items structured on 5-point Likert scales, was given to participants before and after their flipped classroom experiences. Results: Of the 167 participants, 111 returned surveys. Flipped classroom perceptions improved, with mean (SD) FCPI scores increasing from 3.74 (0.75) to 3.94 (0.76) (P <.001). The percentage of participants who preferred flipped classrooms increased from 38% before the course to 53% after (P =.002). Positive changes in FCPI scores were unrelated to module completion. Most participants thought knowledge was enhanced by in-class sessions and online modules equally. Discussion: The FCPI, the first validated measure of participants’ perceptions of a CME flipped classroom, has strong validity evidence. Participants’ perceptions of and preference for the flipped classroom improved after experiencing the flipped CME classroom. These findings support the need to further explore flipped classroom models in CME. © 2016 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006385007"

The use of knowledge brokers (KBs) is one such strategy noted to promote clinician behavior change. The success of using KBs to transfer knowledge relies on their ability to adapt to ever-changing clinical contexts. In addition, with the rapid growth of online platforms as knowledge transfer forums, KBs must become effective in virtual environments. Although the role of KBs has been studied in various clinical contexts, their emerging role in specific online environments designed to support evidence-based behavior change has not yet been described. Our objective is to describe the roles of, and strategies used by, four KBs involved in a virtual community of practice to guide and inform future online KB interventions. Methods: A descriptive design guided this study and a thematic content analysis process was used to analyze online KB postings. The Promoting Action on Research in Health Sciences knowledge transfer framework and online andragogical learning theories assisted in the coding. A thematic map was created illustrating the links between KBs’ strategies and emerging roles in the virtual environment. Results: We analyzed 95 posts and identified three roles: 1) context architect: promoting a respectful learning environment, 2) knowledge sharing promoter: building capacity, and 3) linkage creator: connecting research-to-practice. Strategies used by KBs reflected invitational, constructivism, and connectivism approaches, with roles and strategies changing over time. Discussion: This study increases our understanding of the actions of KBs in virtual contexts to foster uptake of research evidence in pediatric physiotherapy. Our results provide valuable information about the knowledge and skills required by individuals to fulfill this role in virtual environments.

A systematic review was conducted to provide an information system perspective on the current state of WCPD-IPE program evaluation and how current evaluations capture essential theoretical constructs in promoting technology adoption. Methods: Six databases were searched to identify studies evaluating WCPD-IPE. Three investigators determined eligibility of the articles. Evaluation items extracted from the studies were assessed using the Kirkpatrick-Barr framework and mapped to the Benefits Evaluation Framework. Results: Thirty-seven eligible studies yielded 362 evaluation items for analysis. Most items (n = 252) were assessed as Kirkpatrick-Barr level 1 (reaction) and were mainly focused on the quality (information, service, and quality) and satisfaction dimensions of the Benefits Evaluation. System quality was the least evaluated quality dimension, accounting for 26 items across 13 studies. WCPD-IPE use was reported in 17 studies and its antecedent factors were evaluated in varying degrees of comprehensiveness. Discussion: Although user reactions were commonly evaluated, greater focus on user perceptions of system quality (ie, functionality and performance), usefulness, and usability of the web-based platform is required. Surprisingly, WCPD-IPE use was reported in less than half of the studies. This is problematic as use is a prerequisite to realizing any individual, organizational, or societal benefit of WCPD-IPE. This review proposes an integrated framework which accounts for these factors and provides a theoretically grounded guide for future evaluations. © 2017 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021093671"

This is slowly beginning to change. The purpose of this paper is to describe and compare the dominant conceptual models informing each field with the view of increasing understanding and appreciation of the two fields, how they are similar and where they differ, and the current and potential points of intersection. The models include the “knowledge-to-action” (KTA) cycle informing KT, models informing CPD curriculum design and individual self-directed learning, and the Kirkpatrick model for evaluating educational outcomes. When compared through the perspectives of conceptual designs, processes, and outcomes, the models overlap. We also identify shared gaps in both fields (eg, the need to explore the influence of the context in which CPD and KT interventions take place) and suggest opportunities for synergies and for moving forward.

Although simulation education has surged in medical training over the last two decades, several ethically challenging educational methods have arisen. Simulated death has arisen as one of these challenging issues and currently there is no consensus regarding how to best manage this controversial topic in the simulated environment. The goal of this review is to analyze how simulated mortality has been used and discover whether or not this tool is beneficial to learners. Methods: In May 2016, the authors performed a literature search on both Pubmed and the Cochrane database using multiple variations of keywords; they then searched bibliographies and related articles. Results: There were 901 articles acquired in the initial search. The authors eliminated articles that were not relevant to the subject matter. After adding articles from bibliographies and related articles, the authors included the 43 articles cited in this article. Discussion: As a result, the authors of this article believe that death, when used appropriately in simulation, can be an effective teaching tool and can be used in a responsible manner. © 2016 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006395723"

Although lack of motivation is one of the most important barriers of pharmacists' participation in CE, we know little about the quality or the quantity of motivation. We used the self-determination theory, which describes autonomous motivation (AM) as originating from within an individual and controlled motivation (CM) as originating from external factors, as a framework for this study. Our aim was to obtain insight into the quality and quantity of pharmacists' motivation for CE. Methods: The scores of 425 pharmacists on Academic Motivation Scale were subjected to K-means cluster analysis to generate motivational profiles. Results: We unraveled four motivational profiles: (1) good quality with high AM/low CM, (2) high quantity with high AM/high CM, (3) poor quality with low AM/high CM, and (4) low quantity with low AM/low CM. Female pharmacists, pharmacists working in a hospital pharmacy, pharmacists working for more than 10 years, and pharmacists not in training were highly represented in the good-quality profile. Pharmacists working in a community pharmacy, pharmacists working for less than 10 years, and pharmacists in training were highly represented in the high-quantity profile. Male pharmacists were more or less equally distributed over the four profiles. The highest percentage of pharmacy owners was shown in the low-quantity profile, and the highest percentage of the nonowners was shown in the good-quality profile. Discussion: Pharmacists exhibit different motivational profiles, which are associated with their background characteristics, such as gender, ownership of business, practice setting, and current training. Motivational profiles could be used to tailor CE courses for pharmacists.

We developed a tool to assess mentoring activities experienced by faculty and evaluated evidence for its validity. Methods: The National Initiative on Gender, Culture, and Leadership in Medicine-""C-Change""-previously developed the C-Change Faculty Survey to assess the culture of academic medicine. After intensive review, we added six items representing six components of mentoring to the survey-receiving help with career and personal goals, learning skills, sponsorship, and resources. We tested the items in four academic health centers during 2013 to 2014. We estimated reliability of the new items and tested the correlation of the new items with a mentoring composite variable representing faculty mentoring experiences as positive, neutral, or inadequate and with other C-Change dimensions of culture. Results: Among the 1520 responding faculty (response rate 61-63%), there was a positive association between each of the six mentoring activities and satisfaction with both the amount and quality of mentoring received. There was no difference by sex. Cronbach a coefficients ranged from 0.89 to 0.95 across subgroups of faculty (by sex, race, and principal roles). The mentoring responses were associated most closely with dimensions of Institutional Support (r = 0.58, P <.001), Institutional Change Efforts for Faculty Support (r = 0.52, P <.001), Values Alignment (r = 0.58, P <.001), Self-efficacy (r = 0.43; P <.001), and Relationships/ Inclusion/Trust (r = 0.41; P <.001). Discussion: Data demonstrated that the Mentoring scale is a valid instrument to assess mentoring.

This is an important area of work, and initial research with nonprofessional groups has found that practicing compassion through a variety of experiential practices and meditations can lead to higher levels of compassion for others, sensitivity to suffering, motivation to help, and altruism. This study examines outcome measures after a 3-day introductory workshop on compassion-focused therapy provided to health care providers and educators. The aim of the research is to explore whether the training would increase self-compassion and reduce self-criticism and self-persecution. Methods: A total of 28 participants who were classified into three groups ""nurses and midwives,"" ""counselors/psychotherapists,"" and ""other health care providers"" completed the Self-Compassion Scale and Functions of Self-Criticizing and Self-Attacking Scale before and after training. Results: Results reveal an overall statistically significant increase in self-compassion and statistically significant reduction in self-critical judgment after training. There was no statistically significant reduction in self-persecution or self-correction scores after training. Discussion: Developing self-compassion and compassionately responding to our own ""self-critic"" may lead the way forward in the development of more compassionate care among health care professionals. Training people in compassion-based exercises may bring changes in levels of self-compassion and self-critical judgment. The findings are exciting in that they suggest the potential benefits of training health care providers and educators in compassion-focused practices.

We sought to design and evaluate a novel mentorship-based intervention to improve the usage of spirometry in primary care. Methods: This was a prospective one-year study of a pragmatic intervention across Canadian primary care sites. We established mentor-mentee pods, each including physician and nurse/allied health mentors and mentees, and enabled communication through a secure online portal; email; telephone; teleconference; videoconference; fax; and/or in person. We measured (1) change in intention to perform spirometry (through a questionnaire based on the theory of planned behavior, administered before and after the intervention); (2) mentoring uptake; and (3) feedback/satisfaction. Results: Twenty-five of 90 (28%) nurse/allied health and 23/68 (34%) physician mentees consented across seven sites. There were no statistically significant changes in behavioral intention after the intervention. Mentors logged 56.5 hours, with most preferred communication modalities being in person (6/11; 55%) and email (4/11; 36%). Mentees most commonly used email (9/18; 50%), followed by in-person communication (6/18; 33%). Mentees were highly satisfied with the experience, and most (89%) would participate in a similar program again. Discussion: A mentorship-based intervention can successfully engage physicians, nurses, and allied health practitioners through multiple communication platforms. Email seems to be an important medium for this activity. Such interventions can be highly satisfying and may affect certain constructs underlying mentees' behavioral intentions. Such a program can be replicated across diseases, and future research should measure effects on behavior, patient outcomes, and the sustainability of effects. © 2017 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education and the Society for Academic Continuing.

We aimed to (1) validate a measure of participant attitudes toward using a conference app and (2) determine associations between participant characteristics and attitudes toward CME apps with conference app usage. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional validation study of participants at the Mayo Clinic Selected Topics in Internal Medicine Course. A conference app was developed that included presentation slides, note-taking features, search functions, social networking with other attendees, and access to presenter information. The CME app attitudes survey instrument (CMEAPP-10) was designed to determine participant attitudes toward conference apps. Results: Of the 602 participants, 498 (82.7%) returned surveys. Factor analysis revealed a two-dimensional model for CMEAPP-10 scores (Cronbach α, 0.97). Mean (SD) CMEAPP-10 scores (maximum possible score of five) were higher for women than for men (4.06 [0.91] versus 3.85 [0.92]; P = .04). CMEAPP-10 scores (mean [SD]) were significantly associated (P = .02) with previous app usage as follows: less than once per month, 3.73 (1.05); monthly, 3.41 (1.16); weekly, 4.03 (0.69); and daily or more, 4.06 (0.89). Scores were unrelated to participant age, specialty, practice characteristics, or previous app use. Discussion: This is the first validated measure of attitudes toward CME apps among course participants. App usage was higher among younger participants who had previously used educational or professional apps. Additionally, attitudes were more favorable among women and those who had previously used apps. These findings have important implications regarding efforts to engage participants with portable and accessible technology.

To optimize the adoption of eCME and develop efficient and costeffective eCME programs, factors explaining GPs’ intention to use eCME must first be elucidated. Methods: Using the Theory of Planned Behavior as a framework, we developed a questionnaire and administered it to GPs in seven CME seminars in Isfahan, Iran, in 2014. Three domains of GPs’ intention to use eCME were measured: attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms. We used linear and logistic regression to identify the main predictors of intention and behavior. Results: GPs who had high score in perceived behavioral control and a more positive attitude toward e-learning had a higher intention to adopt it for CME. In contrast, subjective norms (eg, social pressures to use eCME) were not a predictor. Attitude toward usefulness of eCME was the main predictor of being an actual eCME user. Discussion: Perceived behavioral control and attitude constitute the main predictors of the intention to use eCME. Establishing discussions forums and strengthening organizational support for eCME through an increased awareness among clinical superiors and CME managers would be expected to increase GPs’ intention to use eCME. © 2016 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006371808"

An important element of bridging is the opportunity for internationally educated health professionals to practice in a clinical environment. To support these health professionals and their clinical instructors, a Clinical Practice Facilitator (CPF) role was created. This study aimed to examine the CPF from internationally educated health professionals and clinical instructors’ perspective. Methods: A quantitative survey was conducted with two cohorts (2013 and 2015) of internationally educated physical therapists and clinical instructors who were asked about the nature of interaction with CPFs, mentor, and education roles and the benefits and challenges of the role. Results: Thirty-five internationally educated physical therapists and 37 clinical instructors participated and were satisfied with the interaction with CPFs via face-to-face or e-mail communication. There was strong agreement (>80%) that the CPF educator role was to facilitate learner’s reflection on clinical practice while the mentor role (>70%) was to answer questions, provide feedback, and investigate clinical concerns and conflicts. There was insufficient time for access to CPFs and resolution of learners’ learning needs. There were differences (P = 0.04) in perspective on the benefit of the CPF in assisting with cultural differences. Discussion: An innovative CPF role provided support encouragement, clinical, and professional advice. There were discordant views regarding the benefits of the CPF role in addressing cultural issues, which requires further examination. © 2016 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006341613"

The objective of this review was to synthesize the research related to prescribers’ critical appraisal knowledge and skills— defined as the understanding of statistical methods, biases in studies, and relevance and validity of evidence. Methods: We searched PubMed and other databases from January 1990 through September 2015. Two reviewers independently screened and selected studies of any design conducted in the United States, the United Kingdom, or Canada that involved prescribers and that objectively measured critical appraisal knowledge, skills, understanding, attitudes, or prescribing behaviors. Data were narratively synthesized. Results: We screened 1204 abstracts, 72 full-text articles, and included 29 studies. Study populations included physicians. Physicians’ extant knowledge and skills were in the low to middle of the possible score ranges and demonstrated modest increases in response to interventions. Physicians with formal education in epidemiology, biostatistics, and research demonstrated higher levels of knowledge and skills. In hypothetical scenarios presenting equivalent effect sizes, the use of relative effect measures was associated with greater perceptions of medication effectiveness and intent to prescribe, compared with the use of absolute effect measures. The evidence was limited by convenience samples and study designs that limit internal validity. Discussion: Critical appraisal knowledge and skills are limited among physicians. The effect measure used can influence perceptions of treatment effectiveness and intent to prescribe. How critical appraisal knowledge and skills fit among the myriad of influences on prescribing behavior is not known. © 2017 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021088408"

SC is also home to a large military and veteran population, and prescription opioid use for chronic pain is alarmingly common among veterans, especially those returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. This article describes the background and development of an academic detailing (AD) educational intervention to improve use of a Prescription Drug Monitoring Program among SC physicians who serve military members and veterans. The aim of this intervention was to improve safe opioid prescribing practices and prevent prescription opioid misuse among this high-risk population. Methods: A multidisciplinary study team of physicians, pharmacists, psychologists, epidemiologists, and representatives from the SC’s Prescription Monitoring Program used the Medical Research Council complex interventions framework to guide the development of the educational intervention. The theoretical and modeling phases of the AD intervention development are described and preliminary evidence of feasibility and acceptability is provided. Results: Ninety-three physicians consented to the study from 2 practice sites. Eighty-seven AD visits were completed, and 59 one-month follow-up surveys were received. Participants rated the AD intervention high in helpfulness of information, intention to use information, and overall satisfaction with the intervention. The component of the intervention felt to be most helpful was the AD visit itself. Characteristics of the participants and the intervention, as well as anticipated barriers to behavior change are detailed. Discussion: Preliminary results support the feasibility of AD delivery to veteran and community patient settings, the feasibility of facilitating Prescription Drug Monitoring Program registration during an AD visit, and that AD visits were generally found satisfying to participants and helpful in improving knowledge and confidence about safe opioid prescribing practices. The component of the intervention felt to be most helpful to the participants was the actual AD visit, and most participants rated their intentions high to use the information and tools from the visit. Intervention key messages, preliminary outcome measures, and successes and challenges in developing and delivering this intervention are discussed to advance best practices in developing educational interventions in this important area of public health. © 2017 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021156810"

It also provided the focus for one of the five keynote lectures presented during the 2016 World Congress on Continuing Professional Development. As the planners of this keynote session, we sought to evoke answers to the question, not from the speaker, but from the audience itself, a process enabled by a highly engaging presentation style and powered by interactive digital technologies. Further, we believed that the session would not directly lead to suggestions to improve the theory and practice of CPD, but rather to create the biopsychosocial context—a sort of platform—on which such discussions can occur.

In our AMC, we undertook a collaborative approach to achieve better vertical and horizontal integration of our QI education efforts. This article provides a case example describing our organizational context, what was done, and with what effect and makes our example and lessons learned available to others. Methods: We developed a new educational QI program that was jointly planned and implemented by a group comprising major QI stakeholders. This project was intended to create horizontal organizational linkages between continuing professional development, clinicians, the hospital, and QI department and produce QI activities that aligned with the strategic objectives of senior management. Results: The group developed and implemented a curriculum based on Lean methodology and concepts from the Institute for Health Care Improvement Model for Improvement. Two cohorts (27 teams) completed the training and planned and implemented QI projects. All projects were aligned with organizational quality, safety, and patient experience goals. The majority of projects met their aim statements. Discussion: This case description provides an example of successful horizontal integration of an AMCs’ QI functions to disseminate knowledge and implement meaningful QI aligned with strategic objectives (vertical integration). © 2016 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Association for Hospital Medical Education, and the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006381039"

Appraisal works best with many sources of information on performance. Multisource feedback (MSF) is widely used in business and in other clinical disciplines to provide such information. It has also been incorporated into nursing appraisals, but, so far, none of the instruments in use for nurses has been validated. We set out to develop an instrument aligned with the UK Knowledge and Skills Framework (KSF) and to evaluate its reliability and feasibility across a wide hospital-based nursing population. Methods: The KSF framework provided a content template. Focus groups developed an instrument based on consensus. The instrument was administered to all the nursing staff in 2 large NHS hospitals forming a single trust in London, England. We used generalizability analysis to estimate reliability, response rates and unstructured interviews to evaluate feasibility, and factor structure and correlation studies to evaluate validity. Results: On a voluntary basis the response rate was moderate (60%). A failure to engage with information technology and employment-related concerns were commonly cited as reasons for not responding. In this population, 11 responses provided a profile with sufficient reliability to inform appraisal (G = 0.7). Performance on the instrument was closely and significantly correlated with performance on a KSF questionnaire. Discussion: This is the first contemporary psychometric evaluation of an MSF instrument for nurses. MSF appears to be as valid and reliable as an assessment method to inform appraisal in nurses as it is in other health professional groups. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on Continuing Medical Education, Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84932083957"

A project was designed to inform and understand knowledge translation and application of this novel tool in multiple health-related settings. Lacking published studies in this area, the authors conceived a conceptual map to guide the project that integrates and adapts elements from several planned action theories. This paper describes the rationale and basis for constructing the Population Health Planning Knowledge-to-Action Model and elaborates on the 2 connected structures of the framework: the Tool Creation Path and the Action Cycle. Although created for an express purpose, this model has the potential to inform application of other tools. This work demonstrates how a research team can adapt and integrate existing frameworks to better align with novel real-world knowledge translation issues. Furthermore, the integration of a population risk tool to support health decision making highlights the interaction between continuing education and knowledge translation. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on Continuing Medical Education, Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84932124307"

This study provides evidence that virtual humans can be used in simulated critical incidents to assess the learning needs of health professionals, and provide important information that can inform the development of continuing education programs in patient safety. We explored the effectiveness of information transfer during a devolving medical situation between postanesthesia care unit (PACU) nurses and a virtual attending physician. Methods: We designed a three-stage scenario: tutorial, patient transfer, and critical incident. We developed 2 checklists to assess information transfer: Critical Patient Information and Interprofessional Communication Skills. All participants were videotaped; 2 raters reviewed all videos and assessed performance using the checklists. Results: Participants (n = 43) who completed all 3 stages scored 62.3% correct on critical patient information transfer and 61.6% correct on interprofessional communication skills. Almost 87% missed a fatal drug error. The checklists measured each item on a 1/0 (done/not) calculation. Additionally, no relationship was found between years of nursing experience and performance on either checklist. Discussion: The PACU nurses in this study did not consistently share critical information with an attending (virtual) physician during a critical incident, and most missed a fatal dosage error. These findings strongly suggest a crucial need for additional structured team training among practicing health care teams, and they demonstrate the utility of using virtual humans to simulate team members. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on CME, Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942040277"

Within cognitive psychology, theories of learning and knowledge acquisition, such as test-enhanced learning (TEL), may be used to enhance the effectiveness of CME protocols and delivery. The present study examined whether the pedagogical benefits of testing can be observed in practicing physicians. Methods: A total of 83 physicians were recruited following an education session on constipation management and were randomized to either (a) the test condition (n = 43), where learners wrote a short test consisting of 10 short-answer questions (SAQs), or (b) the study condition (n = 40), where learners studied the same information. Four weeks later, 56 (68%) physicians completed a final test with 10 new SAQs, with 27 being from the initial test condition and 29 belonging to the initial study condition. Results: Performance on the final SAQ test was equivalent for both test (42.5%) and study-only (41.2%) conditions (p =.71). Discussion: The null findings in the present study are inconsistent with previous research showing the pedagogical benefits of testing relative to studying. Given that most TEL research focuses on novice learners, who lack strong associative memory networks, it is possible that TEL is specific to novices and not generalizable to experts. Alternative explanations focus on the importance of repeated, distributed testing with feedback. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on Continuing Medical Education, Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84932169698"

To get more insight into the reasons of care providers to underuse professional interpreters, we studied fallacies in their arguments. Fallacies in reasoning may explain why care providers avoid changing their behavior even if they are aware of evidence in favor of such behavior. Methods: We did a secondary analysis of interviews about immigrant patients with care providers collected in two studies on inhospital pediatric care. Interviews (N = 37) were held in 2009, in the Netherlands. Interviews were analyzed using a contextual approach to fallacious argumentation: a method that can identify fallacies as “wrong” arguments compared with the context in they are made. Results: We identified six main fallacies that care providers used to argue that they prefer not to use a professional interpreter while having free access to professional interpreters: 1) There are also some negative side effects to using professional interpreters, 2) there is no language problem, 3) it is such an enormous hassle to organize it, 4) I am a good doctor, 5) my medical information is not complex, and 6) patients do not want it. Discussion: Familiarizing care providers with these fallacies can raise their awareness of the wrong arguments to defend their underuse of professional interpreters and can be made part of their training. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84976391734"

The current study sought to understand what factors predicted health care professionals completing the online component of a sexual assault forensic examiner (SAFE) blended learning training program (12-week online course and 2-day in-person clinical skills workshop). Methods: The study used a Web-based survey to examine participant characteristics, motivation, and external barriers that may influence training completion. Hierarchical logistic regression was utilized to examine the predictors of training completion, while the Cox proportional hazards (Cox PH) regression model helped determine the factors associated with the timing of participant attrition. Results: Results show that 79.3% of the enrolled professionals completed the online component. The study also found that clinicians who work in rural communities and those who were interested in a 2-day clinical skills workshop were more likely to complete the online course. In terms of when attrition occurred, we found that participants who were motivated by the 2-day clinical workshop, those who worked in a rural community, and participants interested in the training program because of its online nature were more likely to complete more of the online course. Discussion: Blending an online course with a brief in-person clinical component may serve as a motivator for completing an online course because it provides the opportunity to develop clinical skills while receiving immediate feedback. Participant attrition appears to be less of a concern for rural clinicians because this modality can reduce their barriers to accessing continuing education. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on Continuing Medical Education, Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84932090852"

Clinical care guidelines and educational resources on management of the diseases and devices prevalent in CMC are scarce. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a web-based curriculum on care of CMC for hospitalists at our institution using a novel approach to validate educational content. Methods: Junior faculty collaborated with senior hospitalist peer mentors to create multimedia learning modules on highlydesired topics as determined by needs assessment. Module authors were encouraged to work with subspecialty experts from within the institution and to submit their modules for external peer review. Pilot study participants were asked to complete all modules, associated knowledge tests, and evaluations over a 4-month period. Results: Sixteen of 33 eligible hospitalists completed the curriculum and associated assessments. High scores with respect to satisfaction were seen across all modules. There was a significant increase in posttest knowledge scores (P < 0.001) with sustained retention at 6 months posttest (P < 0.013). Participants were most likely to make changes to their teaching and clinical practice based on participation in this curriculum. Conclusions: We used a novel approach for content development in this curriculum that incorporated consultation with experts and external peer review, resulting in improved knowledge, high satisfaction, and behavior change.

This study examined the validity of a structured abstract rating instrument, evaluated interrater variability, and modeled the impact of interrater variability on abstract ranking decisions. Additionally, we examined whether a more efficient rating process (abstracts rated by two rather than three raters) supported valid abstract rankings. Methods: Data were 4016 sets of abstract ratings from the 2011 and 2013 national scientific conferences for a health discipline. Many-faceted Rasch analysis procedures were used to examine validity of the abstract rating instrument and to identify and adjust for the presence of interrater variability. The two-rater simulation was created by the deletion of one set of ratings for each abstract in the 2013 data set. Results: The abstract rating instrument demonstrated sound measurement properties. Although each rater applied the rating criteria consistently (intrarater reliability), there was significant variability between raters. Adjusting for interrater variability changed the final presentation format for approximately 10-20% of abstracts. The two-rater simulation demonstrated that abstract rankings derived through this process were valid, although the impact of interrater variability was more substantial. Discussion: Interrater variability exerts a small but important influence on overall abstract acceptance outcome. The use of many-faceted Rasch analysis allows for this variability to be adjusted for. Additionally, Rasch processes allow for more efficient abstract ranking by reducing the need for multiple raters. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on Continuing Medical Education, Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924970879"

Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted on primary research studies published up until August 2014. Studies were identified by database searching (Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsychInfo), citation searching, and reference list checking. Studies were restricted to those evaluating the use of clickers as part of the provision of postgraduate education or continuing education programs and were evaluated according to Kirkpatrick’s four levels of training evaluation (reaction, learning, behavior, and results). Results: Seventeen studies met the eligibility criteria. Twelve studies assessed learner and/or speaker reactions, with feedback overwhelmingly positive in all studies. Reported learner benefits included increased attentiveness, engagement, and enjoyment of presentations. Speakers reported that using clickers engaged the audience and assisted in assessing audience comprehension. Eight studies assessed learning outcomes. Higher level evidence obtained from four randomized studies demonstrated significant improvements in knowledge with the use of clickers compared with traditional didactic presentations, but no differences when clickers were compared with an interactive lecture with integrated questions. No studies adequately assessed higher level educational outcomes (behavior and results). Conclusion: Although the use of clickers improves learning environment and learner satisfaction, the limited high-quality data for improvements in learning and behavior outcomes make it uncertain whether the acceptance and implementation of clickers within routine practice-based education programs are warranted at this stage. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84976346949"

In this commentary, we first summarize evidence supporting enhanced practitioner engagement through the creation of a work environment that builds on mutually respectful relationships and valued interdependencies. We then propose a phased, collaborative process that employs practice talk, a term that describes naturally occurring, collegial conversations among members of clinical teams. Planned interactions among team members, facilitated by individuals trained in dialogic techniques, enable health care providers and support staff to share their experiences and expertise, agree on what improvements they would like to make, and test the success of these changes. Participants would be encouraged to express their own suggestions for better practice and disclose strategies that are already working. Dissent would be regarded as an opportunity rather than a barrier. Iterative, sense-making conversations would generate a shared vision, enabling team members to engage in the entire process. Given that practice improvement ultimately depends on frontline providers, we encourage the exploration of innovative engagement strategies that will enable entire clinical teams to develop the collaborative learning skills needed to accomplish their goals. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on Continuing Medical Education, Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924972093"

Therefore, CE meetings could be utilized to enhance nurses' competencies. Methods: In a 3-armed randomized controlled trial, 496 nurses, working in a tertiary medical center, were randomly allocated to a didactic lecture, brainstorming workshop, or the control group (delayed education). Similar instructors (2 clinical pharmacists) prepared and delivered the educational content to all 3 groups. Outcomes were declarative/procedural knowledge (primary outcome), participation rate, and satisfaction. Knowledge was evaluated using a validated researcher-made questionnaire in 3 time points: immediately before, immediately after, and 3 months after each session. Participants' satisfaction was assessed immediately after each meeting via a standard tool. Data were analyzed using appropriate parametric and nonparametric tests. Results: Rate of participation was 37.7% for the lecture group and 47.5% for the workshop group. The workshop participants were significantly more satisfied in comparison with the lecture group (p <.05). Mean knowledge scores were similar at baseline in the 3 study groups (43-47). Immediately after the meeting, knowledge was significantly higher in the lecture group (79.1 ± 11.9 vs 73.7 ± 11.3; p =.01). At the follow-up, knowledge scores of the lecture and workshop groups were similar, while significantly higher than the control group. However, the reduction of knowledge score was significantly higher in the lecture group (-13.0 ± 15.9% vs -5.7 ± 15.1%, p =.02). Discussion: Educational interventions can improve nurses' knowledge of adverse drug reactions. Short-term learning could be achieved with lecture, but the retention of knowledge will be enhanced by simple interactive techniques. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on Continuing Medical Education, Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84932088276"

Our hypothesis was that deeper learning would be positively associated with implementation of planned practice changes. Methods: Thirty-five family physicians were recruited from existing practice-based small learning groups. They were asked to use their usual small-group process while exploring an educational module on peripheral neuropathy. Part of this process included the completion of a practice reflection tool (PRT) that incorporates CTC statements containing a broader set of practice change options-considering change, confirmation of practice, and not convinced a change is needed (""enhanced"" CTC). The statements were categorized using Bloom's taxonomy and then compared to reported practice implementation after 3 months. Results: Nearly all participants made a CTC statement and successful practice implementation at 3 months. By using the ""enhanced"" CTC options, additional components that contribute to practice change were captured. Unanticipated changes accounted for one-third of all successful changes. Categorizing statements on the PRT using Bloom's taxonomy highlighted the progression from knowledge/comprehension to application/analysis to synthesis/evaluation. All PRT statements were classified in the upper 2 levels of the taxonomy, and these higher-level (deep learning) statements were related to higher levels of practice implementation. Conclusion: The ""enhanced"" CTC options captured changes that would not otherwise be identified and may be worthy of further exploration in other CME activities. Using Bloom's taxonomy to code the PRT statements proved useful in highlighting the progression through increasing levels of cognitive complexity-reflecting deep learning. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on CME, Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942014240"

Quality medical education must be available when the health care provider is ready to learn, provide feedback, and maximize translation of knowledge from desk to clinic. To best accomplish these goals, medical education must be personalized to clinicians' needs. Research has defined multiple knowledge/performance gaps among oncologists who manage advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A study was conducted to determine the effectiveness with which a personalized learning approach for oncologists will diminish these gaps. Methods: The authors undertook development, online distribution, and impact measurement of an NSCLC curriculum in which learners' responses to a preeducation self-assessment of knowledge, skills, and attitudes resulted in receipt of a personalized curriculum. Upon completion of the assessment, each learner received a personalized curriculum, which included up to 5 distinct activities selected to address identified knowledge and practice gaps. Feedback was provided at the completion of each activity. Results: Ninety-two oncologists completed an individualized learning plan. Analysis shows that completion of the learning plan was associated with a high effect size (d =70).

Methods: A randomized controlled trial and a simple pre-post design were used, respectively, for each of the two phases of the study. Outcome measures included the Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire and the Maslach Burnout Questionnaire. HR and BP measures were also obtained in the experimental group by means of a digital monitor. Results: After the initial 8 weeks of treatment, significant improvements for the experimental group in mindfulness levels and reductions in emotional exhaustion, HR, and BP were obtained. Effect sizes (Cohen d) significantly increased over the 10-month maintenance period, especially for mindfulness and systolic BP. Acceptance was notably high (low attrition rate and high compliance with program activities).

In the form of a summary report, performance measurement and feedback is an opportunity for clinicians to view data about the care they provide compared with some standard and often with peer and benchmark comparisons. Based on a review of recent evidence and a facilitated discussion with the US and Canadian experts, we describe proper terminology for performance measurement and feedback and other important information about the intervention. We encourage leaders and researchers to consider and build on this guideline as they plan, implement, evaluate, and report efforts with performance measurement and feedback. Clear and consistent use of terminology is imperative, along with complete and accurate descriptions of interventions, to improve the use and study of performance measurement and feedback.

Methodology: Five Bangladeshi therapists from a rehabilitation center participated in the course, which was facilitated online by an Australian university. They completed 8 prerecorded modules over a 3-month period, and were assessed in situ on their ability to deliver a tutorial to their peers. A qualitative explanatory case study design was used to evaluate outcomes, drawing on data gathered from precourse and 1-year follow-up surveys, observations (including interactions during the course and final participant presentations), and a postcourse focus group. Results: The course achieved 6 of its 9 objectives, with all participants satisfactorily planning and delivering an evidence-based interactive tutorial to their peers. Participants noted improved competence and confidence in searching for evidence and developing and executing a teaching plan. This was sustained at 1-year review. The key theme was a shift in participants' capacity for teaching and learning. Enablers were multimodal teaching techniques, the presence of a local leader, and the establishment of informal peer support. Barriers were logistical issues such as access to reliable Internet services and late delivery of course materials. Discussion: Online distance education can be effective in producing sustainable change in practitioner skills in developing countries.

This research reports the relationship among self-efficacy, motivation to change, and the acquisition of knowledge in a continuing medical education (CME) activity. Methods: The measure of individual sense of self-efficacy was a 4-item scale. The measure of motivation was a 6-item scale following on the work of Prochaska and colleagues. The knowledge acquisition was measured in a simple post measure. The participants were enrolled in a CME activity focused on HIV. Results: The CME activities had a significant effect on knowledge. Preliminary analysis demonstrates a relationship among the self-efficacy measure, the motivation to change measure, and global intent to change. Specifically, as reported earlier, the sense of efficacy in effecting change in the practice environment is predictive of a high level of motivation to change that, in turn, is predictive of formation of intent to change practice patterns. Interestingly, there were also relationships among the self-efficacy measure, the motivation to change measure, and knowledge acquisition. Finally, as expected, there was a significant relationship between knowledge and intent to change practice. Discussion: Further inspection of the motivation to change construct suggests that it mediates the self-efficacy constructs' effect on intent as well as its effect on knowledge acquisition. This new finding suggests that the proximal construct motivation completely masks an important underlying causal relationship that appears to contribute to practice change as well as learning following CME-self-efficacy. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on Continuing Medical Education, Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84932111534"

Confusion and inconsistency surrounding many of the terms contributes to this challenge. This international study was commissioned by the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education to use expert opinion to improve the consistency of important educational terminology by describing the essential components of a set of educational interventions, such as educational meetings. This article will describe how this project uses the literature and an expert consensus process to improve precision around the conceptualization and implementation of educational interventions. This article will offer an in-depth description of a hybrid methodology that blends the Chaffee framework for concept explication with a modified Delphi technique that constitutes a novel expert consensus process.

A shortterm postcourse comentoring program was developed with the aim of facilitating workplace implementation of learning after a 3-day course for occupational therapists. The program was evaluated for usefulness, successes, challenges, recommended improvements, and associations with changes in self-rated knowledge and confidence. Method: Two months after the course, 42 participants completed an evaluation of the comentoring program with closed-and open-ended questions addressing usefulness, successes, challenges, pairing preferences, and recommendations. They also completed a record on whether or not they had worked on goals nominated in their comentoring contract. Before and 2 months after the course, they completed a self-rated questionnaire on knowledge and confidence. Results: The comentoring program was recommended by 80% of participants. Benefits included opportunities for information and resource sharing, debriefing, problem solving, reassurance, and implementation of ideas. Ninety-five percent of participants worked on some or all their comentoring goals. Although there were significant improvements in knowledge (P < 0.001) and confidence (P < 0.001), the total comentoring evaluation score was not significantly associated with these changes. It is therefore possible that these improvements related to the course itself rather than the comentoring program. Challenges related to time, scheduling, distance, and pairing of comentors. Conclusion: Reported benefits of the program included enhanced psychosocial support and prompting to trial newly learned strategies. Effectiveness may be improved by setting aside time for comentoring in the workplace and better matching of comentors. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84976416789"

Few programs provide reeducation, and data are limited about these experiences. We describe the physician refresher/reentry program at Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, and the lessons learned in our efforts to facilitate obstetrician-gynecologists' clinical reentry. Methods: In 2006, Drexel relaunched the Medical College of Pennsylvania's physician reentry course. This structured yet individualized program provides reeducation and assessment for physicians who have left clinical medicine for any reason and are hoping to return. We report the results achieved for 9 obstetrician-gynecologists who successfully completed Drexel's course between November 2006 and November 2012. Results: The 6 men and 3 women had left their practices for different reasons. Seven were reentry candidates, and 2 were remediating; none had left practice for medical negligence. Of the reentering physicians, 5 achieved their goal within 1 month. Of the remediating physicians, 1 achieved his/her goal. Discussion: Through continual self-assessment and participant feedback, we have learned to expand our staff and faculty career advisory roles and seek specialty-specific assessment. Despite our small sample size, Drexel's experience may provide guidance to the growing field of obstetrician/gynecologist reentry in the United States. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on Continuing Medical Education, Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924972118"

The article's purpose is to synthesize the systematic review literature about CME effectiveness published since 2003. Methods: We identified 8 systematic reviews of CME effectiveness published since 2003 in which primary research studies in CME were reviewed and physicians' performance and/or patient health outcomes were included as outcome measures. Results: Five systematic reviews addressed the question of ""Is CME Effective?"" using primary studies employing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or experimental design methods and concluded: (1) CME does improve physician performance and patient health outcomes, and (2) CME has a more reliably positive impact on physician performance than on patient health outcomes. The 8 systematic reviews support previous research showing CME activities that are more interactive, use more methods, involve multiple exposures, are longer, and are focused on outcomes that are considered important by physicians lead to more positive outcomes. Discussion: Future research on CME effectiveness must take account of the wider social, political, and organizational factors that play a role in physician performance and patient health outcomes. We now have 39 systematic reviews that present an evidence-based approach to designing CME that is more likely to improve physician performance and patient health outcomes. These insights from the scientific study of CME effectiveness should be incorporated in ongoing efforts to reform systems of CME and health care delivery. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on Continuing Medical Education, Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84932187175"

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of continuing medical education (CME) on health care professionals' clinical decision making with regard to HSA administration and the costs of quality (COQ). A quasi-experimental study of time series association of CME intervention with COQ and use of HSA solution was conducted at the Surgery Department of the Hospital Valjevo, Serbia. The CME contained evidence-based criteria for HSA solution administration in surgical patients. The preintervention period was defined as January 2009 to May 2011. CME was provided in June 2011, with the postintervention period June 2011 to May 2012. Methods: Total mortality rate, the rate of nonsurgical mortality, the rate of surgical mortality, the rate of sepsis patient mortality, index of irrational use of HSA solutions, and number of hospital days per hospitalized patient were collected for each month as quality indicators. Statistical analysis was performed by multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average (MARIMA) modeling. The specification of the COQ was performed according to a traditional COQ model. Results: The CME intervention resulted in an average monthly reduction of the hospital days per hospitalized patient, the rate of sepsis patient mortality, index of irrational use of HSA solutions, and COQ for $593,890.77 per year. Discussion: Didactic CME presenting evidence-based criteria for HSA administration was associated with improvements in clinical decisions and COQ. In addition, this study demonstrates that models combining MARIMA and traditional COQ models can be useful in the evaluation of CME interventions aimed at reducing COQ. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on Continuing Medical Education, Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84932085829"

Methods: The mentoring program aimed to facilitate faculty in their career planning, and targeted either early-career or midcareer faculty in 5 cohorts over 4 years, from 2010 to 2014. Each cohort of 9-12 faculty participated in a yearlong program with foundations in adult learning, relationship formation, mindfulness, and culture change. Participants convened for an entire day, once a month. Sessions incorporated facilitated stepwise and values-based career planning, skill development, and reflective practice. Early-career faculty participated in an integrated writing program and midcareer faculty in leadership development. Results: Overall attendance of the 51 participants was 96%, and only 3 of 51 faculty who completed the program left the medical school during the 4 years. All faculty completed a written detailed structured academic development plan. Participants experienced an enhanced, inclusive, and appreciative culture; clarified their own career goals, values, strengths and priorities; enhanced their enthusiasm for collaboration; and developed skills. Discussion: The program results highlight the need for faculty to personally experience the power of forming deep relationships with their peers for fostering successful career development and vitality. The outcomes of faculty humanity, vitality, professionalism, relationships, appreciation of diversity, and creativity are essential to the multiple missions of academic medicine. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on CME, Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942065976"

Formative feedback regarding team performance is an essential component. While effective use of simulation for assessment or training requires accurate rating of team performance, examples of rater-training programs in health care are scarce. We describe our rater training program and report interrater reliability during phases of training and independent rating. Methods: We selected an assessment tool shown to yield valid and reliable results and developed a rater training protocol with an accompanying rater training handbook. The rater training program was modeled after previously described high-stakes assessments in the setting of 3 facilitated training sessions. Adjacent agreement was used to measure interrater reliability between raters. Results: Nine raters with a background in health care and/or patient safety evaluated team performance of 42 in-situ simulations using post-hoc video review. Adjacent agreement increased from the second training session (83.6%) to the third training session (85.6%) when evaluating the same video segments. Adjacent agreement for the rating of overall team performance was 78.3%, which was added for the third training session. Adjacent agreement was 97% 4 weeks posttraining and 90.6% at the end of independent rating of all simulation videos. Discussion: Rater training is an important element in team performance assessment, and providing examples of rater training programs is essential. Articulating key rating anchors promotes adequate interrater reliability. In addition, using adjacent agreement as a measure allows differentiation between high- and low-performing teams on video review. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on Continuing Medical Education, Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84932084612"

The new approaches take into account related phenomena such as ""uncertainty,"" ""ambiguity,"" and ""chaos."" To illustrate these approaches, we will use the example of assessment of clinical reasoning, although the principles we outline may apply equally well to assessment of other constructs in medical education. Theoretical perspectives include a discussion of script theory, assimilation theory, self-regulated learning theory, and situated cognition. Assessment examples to include script concordance testing, concept maps, self-regulated learning microanalytic technique, and work-based assessment, which parallel the above-stated theories, respectively, are also highlighted. We conclude with some practical suggestions for approaching nonlinearity. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on CME, Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942067829"

However, although context is considered significant in the success (or lack thereof) of an intervention, there is a lack of consensus on what exactly context is. This scoping review arises from concerns surrounding the opaque, complex, and potentially problematic relationship between context and the effective design and implementation of CME interventions. In this article, we present a protocol for examining how context is discussed within the CME literature. The specific purpose of this scoping review is to summarize the breadth of existing evidence on context within the North American CME literature. The scoping review methodology will also highlight gaps in the current literature, which can inform future research endeavors.

In postgraduate medical education we have traditionally had a faculty-centric model. That is, faculty knew what needed to be taught and who were the best teachers to teach it. They built the agenda, and worked with staff to follow Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) accreditation criteria and manage logistics. Changes in the health care marketplace now demand a learner-centric model-one that embraces needs assessments, identification of practice gaps relative to competency, development of learning objectives, contemporary adult learning theory, novel delivery systems, and measurable outcomes.

Methods: During 2007-2009, our National Initiative on Gender, Culture and Leadership in Medicine (C - Change) conducted a cross-sectional study of faculty from 26 representative AHCs in the United States using the 74-item C - Change Faculty Survey to assess relationships of faculty characteristics and various aspects of the institutional culture (52% response rate). Among the 2178 eligible respondents (assistant, associate, and full professors), we classified their mentoring experience as either inadequate, neutral, or positive. Results: In this national sample, 43% of the 2178 respondents had inadequate mentoring; only 30% had a positive assessment of mentoring. There was no statistical difference by sex, minority status, or rank. Inadequate mentoring was most strongly associated with less institutional support, lower self-efficacy in career advancement, and lower scores on the trust/relationship/inclusion scale. The percent of faculty who had seriously considered leaving their institution was highest among those who had inadequate mentoring (58%), compared to those who were neutral (28%) or had positive mentoring (14%) (all paired comparisons, p < .001). Discussion: In a national survey of faculty of US AHCs, mentoring was frequently inadequate and this was associated with faculty contemplating leaving their institutions. Positive mentoring, although less prevalent, was associated with many other positive dimensions of AHCs. © 2015 The Alliance for Continuing Education in the Health Professions, the Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education, and the Council on CME, Association for Hospital Medical Education.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942021828"
